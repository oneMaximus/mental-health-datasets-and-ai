2025-11-08 22:41:13;Depressed and unable to find a purpose in life;"In the past 1 year, my life has changed completely. I (27F) now find myself dealing with depression, constant pressure, and a meaningless existence with no will to live.

Uptil 6 months ago, I had a thriving career in a very niche field, being paid well above all my peers. For the first time in my 5 year-long career, I was at a job that I absolutely loved, with a wonderful manager, great colleagues, and a work-life balance. I got my own little rented place an hour away from my parents to be closer to my boyfriend, and make some new friends.

Additionally, I have always grown up with a wonderful social circle. Uptil a few months ago, I had solid friendships that were 10+ years old with people I trusted with my life. I have gained some weight over the last few years but overall I was healthy. However, my relationship with my boyfriend has been rocky over the last 1 year, with us constantly fighting.

Today, I have close to nothing. I got laid off from this amazing job in June, got yelled at/cut off by most of my friends, got backstabbed, and got diagnosed with a hoard of health issues. My love life hasn't gotten any better- I constantly feel inadequate and unsure about where I am. I feel unloved all the time.

Every morning I wake up with no purpose. I no longer feel like finding a purpose, either. I spend the entire day in bed with hardly anyone to talk to. I had to leave my rented place and move back in with my parents to save money, and now I feel so embarrassed to be a burden on them again. I still haven't found a job despite trying so damn hard. I still cry for hours on end, and cannot get over how much I have lost so quickly. I don't know what to do anymore. Everybody keeps telling me 'You'll find a job soon' 'It takes time' but its easy to say when you're not in this situation. I am not used to not working. I have no will to do anything anymore. Not even to take care of myself.

I don't have a specific purpose of posting this, maybe someone out there relates.";r/depression;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1orr2aa/depressed_and_unable_to_find_a_purpose_in_life/
2025-11-08 22:01:26;"I don't seem to ""want anything""";"I'm in my mid-40s and have never had clear ""self-defining desires"". What do you think this pattern looks like?

**Some curious absences:**

* No personal signature, clothing style, or interest in home decor.
* Still live in my mother's house; no desire to move or travel. Only went on holidays when pushed, and never helped plan them.
* Had no plan after university; stayed for a PhD just to avoid deciding anything. Picked a supervisor at random, did very little for 2.5 years, then dropped out.
* No ambitions or identity-forming goals. Spent 20s underemployed. In 30s fell into a sysadmin job via nepotism, still doing junior work and struggling with motivation.
* No sustained hobbies - just “procrastination hobbies” like language-learning or recreational maths puzzles, without purpose.

**Socially:**

* As an undergraduate, barely spoke to anyone; didn’t socialize outside brief small talk before lectures.
* I now have a few friends but rarely initiate contact. Happy when they reach out.
* Care a lot about others’ opinions. Not Schizoid - it’s not indifference.

**Other traits:**

* Poor at reading others’ minds; scored low on Baron-Cohen’s “eyes” test.
* Slow at learning physical skills; terrible at team sports.
* No real nightmares or erotic dreams. Generally low self-esteem; occasional suicidal ideation, but still able to enjoy humor.
* Broadly ASD-like traits, but without sensory issues or routines. “Special interests” were always directionless, and now absent.
* Used to say: “The deepest truth about me is that I don’t want anything at all” and later, “Life and I have nothing to offer one another.”
* Some preferences exist (cooking, comedy, film, abstract philosophy) but nothing tied to identity.

**I haven’t fully ""given up"":**

* Use Bumble; sometimes make connections but self-sabotage by dropping conversations.
* Tried Betterhelp six times, quitting early each time.
* Recently got an ADHD diagnosis, mostly to try medication. Methylphenidate didn't help much - mainly it helped me to ""procrastinate with greater focus"".
* Start projects (cybersecurity, drone flying, assembly language) but seem to abandon them very quickly.";r/mentalhealth;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1orq5d1/i_dont_seem_to_want_anything/
2025-11-08 21:41:52;Ive been depressed my whole life;"( sorry if it's unorganized.)
I dont know if it's a write place to write all these things. Im a 18 y old female and I was diagnosed with BPD,OCD, and PTSD. Ive been suicidal many times in my life ( when i was 6,13,14). Every day is a struggle for me because i obsses and panick over anythinf. My body is stressed 7/24. Ive been bullied and sexually insulted many times when i was 13-15. I always obsess over things such as body image, person, or a hobby. Im obssesed over my ex for 3 years. I dont want him back but I always dream about him and there is a different version of him in my brain. However, I wanna lose weight 7/24. I was overweight but now im in a healthy range but my mind tells me to lose weight. Im a pretty girl and a get a lot of attention from people but some days i feel horribly ugly. I also feel really guilty for being a person like this. I wanna get better and live my life peacefully. Ive grown up in an extremely traumatic family but now our family is quiet ( my dad passed away). I love my mom and have a good relationship with her. Im also a people pleaser ";r/depression;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1orppm0/ive_been_depressed_my_whole_life/
2025-11-08 21:05:58;Feeling the most alone and isolated;"In my 30s and feeling the most alone and isolated ever. Since I was a kid I’ve always felt alone. I had no dad and my mother is an addict. I suffered a lot of traumatic shit. School was hell, I barely had friends and had severe social anxiety which I found out more recently it’s due to being Neurodivergent. 

I am diagnosed with BPD and other mental health conditions. I am sober for over 8 years and found while I was using, it’s the best I’ve ever felt because despite the wrong people around me, for once in my life I didn’t feel alone. 

Earlier this year I attempted for the first time as I was going thru a severe mental health episode. I was bad for a couple months but then felt support coming to me from my program. I felt really good, the best in a while for 6 months. However the last 2 months I’ve felt severely lonely again.

I have no family. I had to cut them off due to drugs and abuse. I have a sister who doesn’t respond or initiate msgs unless she needs to vent about our mother. I am single, I work full time but everyone at work is quite fake and has no interest in being friends. I have two friends from high school that I’ve grown apart from, they both live the other side of the country and we barely talk. My last two best friends cut me off, one because I was busy with work for three weeks and wouldn’t play games with her and the other because of my mental health when I attempted said I was a lot. I had two friends from my program, one I was the most vulnerable to and I ended up catching feelings. I told them and it was one sided and now the dynamic has changed even though I’m over them, and we are no longer close and I can’t use them for support. The other has been controlling to me so I felt the need to distance. 

I have tried for years, to make friends and better myself. I have joined random events, groups, posted on reddit, facebook etc. I’ve just been ghosted mostly when I’ve made plans to catch up from them. I’ve tried dating apps, apps for friendship and had no luck. When I do attract friendship/relationships, it’s always a one sided. I’ve been described as loving and loyal, yet I end up getting manipulated. 

I have no one in my life I could just msg or call and ask for support/have a conversation with. I don’t feel close to anyone at all. I am feeling the most alone I’ve ever felt. I feel like a burden. I feel like a problem. I’ve tried therapy and everything but nothing gets better. The person who I had feelings for, I told them how alone I was feeling twice and they just didn’t respond to that at all. 

I feel I’m at my breaking point and I don’t know how much longer I can hold on. ";r/mentalhealth;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oroxxx/feeling_the_most_alone_and_isolated/
2025-11-08 20:48:39;Severely depressed for a decade. Got my hopes up about ADHD diagnosis, life still sucks;"Hello! This is going to be a bit of a doozy but definitely open to advice or hearing about your experiences. 



I have struggled with depression + anxiety for about 9 years. This has resulted in substance abuse; cannabis dependency since my teens and a blackout belligerent drunk on the weekends for 10 years (last drink on 8/31/25 tho!). Binge-eating disorder, like 40 lbs overweight. Diet in general has been garbage for the last 2 years. Avoidant tendencies due to low self-esteem, shame and rejection sensitivity. This leads to me being miserable at work because nobody likes me, it's a cycle/pattern that has happened for the last 5ish years. Been through so many jobs, like 30 in my life. Been at this one for 2 months and already solidified my reputation as antisocial. Emotional dysregulation, mostly manifesting as irrational anger. Horrible social anxiety around friends/family, authoritative figures, and those who I feel may be trying to ""read me"" or think of me as inadequate or unintelligent. I had a young cousin (also best friend) die at my apartment from an OD, which led to me getting blackout drunk for a good month and making a complete fool of myself in front of my whole hometown, family, friends. There's definitely more but I'll spare you.



Recently have gained enough motivation to seek therapy and treatment for my mental health, as well as an ADHD diagnosis. Leading up to starting treatment, I read every post on r/ADHD of folks starting meds and having their lives changed overnight. This did not happen to me, and it's been devastating. I have tried a few things to treat the anxiety/depression but nothing has stuck. I hate meds with 6-8 week onset periods. I hate the fact that SSRIs prevent me from feeling emotion, even when I'd like to cry I can't. I hate that I can't enjoy an orgasm on them. And it still didn't help my anxiety enough. I still didn't want to leave the house.

  
The ADHD meds give me energy (no shit, it's speed) and can def help improve my mood if things are going well, but I find that a bad day is amplified while medicated. I find that my mind still races, probably more, which is a root cause of my issues IMO. The social anxiety is pretty brutal. It just doesn't do what I thought it would, and I'm bummed. I was hoping it would calm the perpetual storm in my head. I have found myself being a bit abusive with the meds as well, to keep the energy/motivation going. 

  
I know what I have to do. Stay away from booze, work on my weight, which will naturally relieve some social anxiety due to a confidence boost. Probably cut way back on weed, because it can't be helping with brain fog/anxiety. Work on my behavior in social settings and my relationship with the workplace. Thing is, I've been at this point so many times before, and always slip back to my old ways. On the bright side, I think the adderall has been keeping me motivated enough to not even think about drinking, whereas in the past, if I found myself in as much stress and pain that I'm in now, I surely would be drinking. I would be hungover right now, absolutely hating my life. It's not so bad I guess!

2025-11-08 19:40:30;Not really sure whats up with myself;"For as long as I remember, I’ve always been pretty empathetic to other people, I’d say to a level greater than the average person. While this is nice and all, I find it weird how I can’t feel the same when it comes to myself. It’s like I’m incapable of feeling anger when I’m supposed to, or jealousy when someone I know does something great. It’s my thoughts in my head that make me realise later on, that I probably should be feeling this way.

This isn’t to say I have never felt angry for myself, but I think that feeling just doesn’t come to me naturally often. Like its pretty hard for me to get offended by anything.

It might be the reason why I feel little to no interest in a lot of things in my life. I don’t really know what my future looks like, and its like I feel nothing despite that. While I do get interested in things like playing sports, games, it never trespasses into becoming an actual hobby that I feel passionate about. I don’t think I have ever felt passionate about anything in regards to myself. I don’t really know anything about myself.

I’m in uni right now (first year) and I don’t even know if i want to continue doing it. I give up early on in my classes from a mixture of procrastination and anxiety, and the only thing that makes me feel bad is my group who have to deal with my problems. I feel nothing for ruining my own education.

 I also get called ‘easy-going’ a lot by my friends, and I have to admit I actually am pretty social when I’m around people. I can converse, joke around, go on a rant about random things, and I do these things with emotions behind them. I am well liked by most people I interact with. But thats it. Outside of that its as though I feel no desire, only towards whats happening externally.

I did recently get diagnosed with ADHD, but this seems a little more than just that. Either way I’m probably going to take a break from uni. It isn’t right to be pulling down other people for my own mishaps. Im just lost I guess";r/mentalhealth;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ornbw9/not_really_sure_whats_up_with_myself/

2025-11-08 14:17:45;I feel like I have forgotten how to be social.;"There was a time when I was social and confident. I could talk to anyone, fit in anywhere and never overthink what to say. I’m still confident in many ways but when it comes to being social, something just doesn’t click anymore.

It didn’t happen overnight. Until I was about 14, things were fine. Then slowly, I started feeling out of place. I didn’t fit in with my old friends and even when I tried changing circles, nothing changed. I was still the one getting ignored, left behind or just… unseen.

Now I’m in college. I have friends but my social skills are practically dead. Conversations feel forced and no matter how much I try by working on my body language, confidence or tone it just doesn’t feel right. Even around my family, I feel disconnected and have no idea what to do in social situations.

The thing is, I know I wasn’t always like this and that gives me hope. I’ve been diagnosed with a few mental disorders, so I understand why things ended up this way. But I don’t want to stay like this forever. I don’t need to be friends with everyone, I just want to be able to communicate like a normal person again.

2025-11-08 12:59:12;my “depression” is so selfish;On paper, I’ve got nothing to be depressed about. A great family that’s doing well financially, good grades, a few great friends, and more. I know that if a lot of people had these things, they wouldn’t be depressed in the slightest, but I still “am”. And I’m not even diagnosed, I just feel sad, lonely, and exhausted everyday. The main part of it is that I’ve got no one to talk to about my feelings. I can’t tell my parents because my siblings already have mental health issues and so they see me as their “break” or their “perfect, smart” child. I can’t talk to my friends either because I’m only in middle school and telling them about my feelings would probably just be worse for them overall because I’m not sure if they have the kind of care I want. This is so incredibly selfish of myself, and I know that, but I don’t know why I feel like this or why I’m not trying to find other help. I also feel so selfish because I know part of me is only making this post for attention, I just want to be noticed, but I feel so inconsiderate and I hate myself for it. I just don’t know what to do anymore because I feel so lonely. I just want a real person that I can genuinely talk to about my feelings, but I know that’s selfish and inconsiderate and will never happen anytime soon. I shouldn’t even need someone because I’ve got nothing to be “depressed” about in the first place.

2025-11-08 10:57:16;why am i so lazy? and how do i not be?;"(first and foremost, sorry if this doesn't count for this sub, and while i don't have an official diagnosis, several of my own traits align with depression (not to get ahead of myself, it could be coincidence), and i'd like to be told where to go if the post is taken down. also, r/mentalhealth was useless, so i resorted to this).

I'll sometimes say to myself (internally) ""you gotta study bro, notebook is right there just grab it and read for a good 2 hours, you had a 4 days free in a row c'mon"". and then just ignore myself entirely and busy myself with anything that isn't more work.

for example, i'm taking a programming course (which i like btw), and guess what, i'm not practicing or anything, even not doing the optional homework.

i have a whopping 3 or 4 subjects i have tests in next week, and i refuse to study, how absolutely amazing.

like, i'm willing to study strategies to clear levels in games, team comps., and tactics against enemies and such, even make whole theories on symbolisms in my favorite media and such, but not fulfill my one obligatory responsibility at least. my one.

and everytime i think of studying, i just grab something and distract myself.

i also have crazy mood swings. one moment i'll be smoking that hopium and hyped up, and seconds later i'm a complete nihilistic bastard. one moment i'm excited, the next everything goes to shit and i grow mad, or sad, etc.

so, i ask, why? and how do i not?

PS: therapy isn't an option for now, and i live in an emotionally dumb household, just so ya'll know";r/depression;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1orebli/why_am_i_so_lazy_and_how_do_i_not_be/
2025-11-08 09:00:07;My thoughts on defiance disorder and my cousin ❤️not just a kid being a stubborn kid;"when he was born, we had him until he was 4, after which he was taken by his abusive father who had sachildren/abuse He was with his father for a year probably a few weeks or months and then suffered severe separation trauma. He lived with his aunt until he was 8, when she passed away, and we finally got him back.

I deal with my cousin, who has the disorder, daily because he lives with me. I believe that defiant disorder is caused by trauma at least in some cases, because it can happen to anybody, and it is oddly more common in people with autism and people do tend to have a mild defiance.

Like, if someone asks you to do something and you say no, maybe joking or because you don’t want to directly, that’s mild defiance. You’re expressing your internal thoughts outwardly but not causing a big effect on people

Where defiance disorder becomes a problem when a child hurts themselves or others to avoid rules. They are hurting other people as well. Now my cousin does come from a traumatic background because of autism and him being a boy.

I feel like people were harsh with him without explaining things properly. In some households, children are told to do things because the adult says so. While many children accept this, autistic children often do not, and questioning for some childish parents will cause them to get angry.

A Child sees the way a adult dealing with their issues or anger about them, and even though it seems counterintuitive, mimicking this can cause bigger problems.

If defiance isn’t addressed, it might develop into conduct disorder, and if conduct left unchecked, possibly a personality disorder. That’s my view, considering my cousin’s impulsiveness, which may involve underlying issues not diagnosed yet.

Examples include him being stubborn enough to get hurt like eating too much until sick, ignoring rules about food amounts, or sneaking food and burning himself in the process.

He’s also been very sick him not listening to people's boundaries, and spread sickness around the house by touching others or himself, believing he was no longer contagious because he said so, just to be defiant. He was upset when we couldn’t go to a event. He had taken his own fun, trying to be stubborn, by crossing people's boundaries.

Him not wanting to tie his shoes, leading to slips, and ran off while trick or treating or crossing the street

Him refusing to do something very simple tasks, and during tantrums, spilled water, refused to clean, and kept touching me. I told him to stop, threatening to take away privileges each time he touched me 1hour from tv if he didn’t respect boundaries. After repeated reminders, he eventually got himself together because he knew I wouldn’t give in. Sometimes I do let him pass because of his anger issues, but he needs to learn boundaries for his safety and for other people's safety and said no for a whole day and next . These are extremely mild ones.

Dangerous examples as him not wanting to stop playing with knives, which are now out of reach. Parenting around this disorder is challenging. While trauma can cause it, I believe some children have multiple disorders. They might be dealing with something that can’t be diagnosed at such a young age and them not understanding social cues and then I think a lot of things can be worked out before it gets worse.

he sees no difference between a adult and child or doesn’t care. And are rude to both making his siblings distressed.";r/mentalhealth;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1orbvkw/my_thoughts_on_defiance_disorder_and_my_cousin/

Me and my husband have been together for about 6 years and married for a year. He has bipolar disorder and takes his meds regularly. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD about 4 years ago, but I had to stop taking my meds after losing my health insurance.

Lately, I’ve been struggling really bad with insecurity and paranoia. I keep feeling like he’s hiding something from me, even though he’s never actually given me a reason not to trust him. He always seems a little distant from me, and I can’t tell if it’s because something’s really wrong or if I’m just overthinking and driving myself crazy.

I hate that I keep checking his accounts and overanalyzing everything. I love him so much, but I can’t seem to quiet my mind or stop assuming the worst. I can’t afford insurance or medication right now, and it’s really starting to take a toll on me.

Sometimes I just feel hopeless — like I’m never enough for him, or anyone. I don’t want to feel like this anymore.

2025-11-08 08:27:36;Is this psychosis?;"TW: 

The voices In my head are not mine. They can sound like mumbling, talking to each other, commanding me to do horrible things, calling me names and laughing. They sound like there's two men behind me whispering or yelling. But they dont know If Its psychosis or what. Does anyone else deal with this? I feel I need to act on when they command me to do things, I've severely self harmed, attempted my life, tourted myself really. Sometimes I can also hear voices In the inside of my head..is this normal? I know everyone has a voice In there head but It still doesnt seem like mine. 

In 2020 I had what I can describe as a psychotic episode? I believed the universe would hurt my family and boyfreind some how, I had to sh In specific ways over and over again. Id be doing it till I pass out including making myself vomit. Eight times a day for two years. Ive been sh since little but not like this. I have flashbacks to horrible it was, I thought my mom was out to get me, said some horrible things to her. Hurt myself with glass off the street, ran away, didn't shower for a month cause I didn't wanna ""wash away the evidence."" Anyway anti psychotics helped me. 

Been In and out of the pyshc ward since little and Im a unique case like complex becuase of trauma and history I dont check all the boxes for just one thing. Been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, ptsd, different eating disorders,  Generalized anxiety disorder,  Cluster c trates,  Cluster b trates, major depression with psychosis then changed to unspecified psychotic features. My voices are always negative. 

Im not self harming anymore but Im still really mentally sick. I developed like paranoia or Severe anxiety Idk but someone will sexually assault me or kill me If I leave the room. Havent left the apartment by myself In three years, lost all my freinds. When Im with my boyfreind im still looking over my shoulder, getting panic attacks/mental breakdowns etc) im so alone and Isolated i used to be so dependent then this whole thing happened, Id run, id walk, go to store, now I cant. Like Im disabled. I have severe Obsessive thoughts, body self esteem. And now suicdel thoughts. I havent thougjt of an attempt in so long, but today I really did. I dont wanna die I just wanna escape but I've been trying to get help for years and nothings worked. I just wanna know if anyone else has these symptoms. Does it sound like psychosis? My voices are all the time but often just random things or mumbles. But it can be annoying and scary. All these disorders make me suffer a great deal. Im on disabilty and get 200$ a month but That's not very much for living so others pay for me. :( I hate that.

2025-11-08 07:58:44;GP thinks i may have ptsd;"Long story short I was in a relationship for about 4yrs. It was very toxic and horrible time. Ex has recently gone to jail due things he has done. 

I left him 10yrs ago. Not too long after leaving him my mental health went bad and still isn't great. I have panic attacks most nights because of things he said just echo's in my head. I can't watch anything I used like watching. The same goes for games. There places i can't go without getting stressed out. I get either really angry if people bring up my ex or I dissociate and stop responding. 

Now recently there's a dad at my child preschool that looks eerily like my ex. Everytime I see him i start to panic and I flinch. I feel really bad for doing it and I know he has noticed. Now I'm starting to think my gp is onto something with thinking I may have it.

I have been diagnosed with general/social/medical anxiety and this year got diagnosed with trauma induced existential crisis.

I would be talking to my psychologist about this but she had to medically retire. So currently waiting see my mental health women's dr to help connect me with a psych that suited for me. 

I feel I'm ready talk about my ex  but I also don't feel ready and want to keep avoiding it and pretend it doesn't exist. 

My women's dr thinks I should give rapid eye movement therapy a go, not sure if that would help? 

I don't think I meet the criteria for ptsd it doesn't seem like its bad enough for it, idk to be honest. Will have to talk to a psych about it.

Also been a bit stressed out lately because what my ex did has been blasted all over the news and fb so I got people asking me questions that I give really vague answers to.

Sorry for the rambling just got  no one to talk about this at the moment or would just listen in general. Honestly just want it to all go away

2025-11-08 07:38:24;"Started Vraylar, Feeling More Depressed And Need Advice
Need Support";"So about a week ago (ayy), I started taking Vraylar in addition to Lexapro for my depression. I possibly have de personalization too, though I'm not diagnosed with that and it's more just along the lines of we think I have it.

Ever since I started Vraylar, I have been feeling more depressed then usual. Which given that my depression was already pretty bad before, means it's reallllllly bad right now. I have just been laying in bed most of the day. I have completely lost interest in my hobbies and can only do them for a little bit before wanting to lay down again. At first I thought that the medication was making me really tired, and that could still be the case. But I feel like the tiredness is because of me feeling more depressed.

The weird thing is, I want to keep going. I really want to stick it out and see if this works as it says that Vraylar takes a few weeks to really kick in. And the fact that I actually feel something from this medication is more than I can say for most other things I've taken to try and help my depression. My doctor is not being very helpful when it comes to this part. He's just saying it's up to me. So I figured I'd reach out on here and see if anyone can give me their experiences here. I'm currently unemployed, so I don't really have any big responsibilities to attend to. So I can definitely stick it out and see if it works. I'm really hoping that this is just a temporary thing and will go away once the medication kicks in. Am I high on copium here?

Hi everyone, I'm quite new to reddit, my apologies if I'm not following the rules adequately.

I am a disabled, wheelchair bound men of 32 years old, and I suffer from medical diagnosed Obsessive Control Disorder. Not to mention I'm always up and down in my depression. I am being very well followed by my psychiatrist.

The questions I would like to leave here are the following:

- how can you cure a person that created a completely different future on his mind ?
Nowadays I think it was just a coping mechanism, but nowadays I feel like I really won't be able to make the things I want and to be accepted for who I am.

Today I feel like I reached my age and had nothing I imagined I would have, both in relationships, like in job, like in studies,  like in friendship. 

I honestly just feel like my time is getting shorter and shorter and that I did not live life. And this is making me hugely depressed and even angered.

Anyone can help me or provide a way?

2025-11-08 05:59:16;I have been struggling and need advice.;"Not sure where I should post this so I apologize if this is not the correct place.



Over the last couple years I have felt like I've been falling apart. I have a really bad habit of not brushing my teeth, skipping showers for an extended amount of time, not doing my dishes, not cleaning cat litter, and many other tasks that I assume most people don’t have trouble with. I wonder most of the time if I am lazy or if there is something wrong in my brain. When I think about doing these tasks, it feels impossible to start. I get really worked up about how much stuff I need to get done that I don’t even attempt to at all. When I get too overwhelmed, or sometimes just alone in my apartment, I fantasize about suicide. It’s not often, but when it does come up I thankfully justify not doing it. I think about family, friends and my pets. I have also developed a really bad habit over the last year of showing up to work late. It is typical that I will be 10-15 minutes late to work everyday. Sometimes it is more like 30 minutes late. I will also call off of work a lot, I will even lie about being sick so I can take a few more days off. When this happens I feel bad about it, like I am letting everyone down that I work with. I just continue to do it though. Because of all the missed work, I barely have enough money to survive. I have a single bedroom apartment. What little money I do have, I spend on DoorDash. When rent is due, I usually have to ask my mom for help. 50-100 bucks usually to cover the rent cost. There is so much more I could post about, but I am honestly just looking for advice. I want to feel better. I think I might have ADHD or depression. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder at a young age. I am 28 now. I don’t deal with the anxiety as much now as I used to. Regardless of that, I am seeking some advice or answers from someone who may be able to help me out or point me in a different direction.

2025-11-08 04:08:18;Mental health disappointments;"What i am dealing with is the fact the I had a psychosis for almost a 2:year period and as I started to wake up from it and as I have researched trying to get better and learn about myself and my mental health issues, I find it utterly disappointing that I have never been told of having been labeled schizo affective and put on an antipsychotic drug with such side affects as it has. It turned me zombiish and unmotivated and I am struggling so hard. I have been denied ssdi and SSI and I'm still about to reapply. I have had to use this past year to look into my medical history and the zip files hidden in the books and crannies of my medical records to understand what the Drs were coding in there about me, and I found some files dealing with some pretty awful stuff I saw they were going to try after id been taken to the ER one day. The path they were trying to project for me would have stolen my rights and locked me away like I was some ward, and they were even going to try to file a charge against me because my poor dog is blind with unfixable eye problems but it didn't stop someone from looking up statues to try and give me charges and get me in trouble for going to the ER. I won't trust any of them again. I fired the whole bunch and started over w my original PCP I've had since I was a child. I did not have my records transferred and I'm so mad about how I've been documented and railroaded towards a certain path that I somehow out navigated away from by making self advocating choices about my care and now I'm not being manipulated by the psychiatric branch or the therapy branch to be broken down and blown apart like they are going to pretend they are going to build me back up or fix me for the better, safer good of humanity because they have preconceived programming and evidence based procedures that steal your life and your rights. I don't know what all is in my future now that they've labeled me as schizo affective but I know I'll never ever show any weakness even if I can't work and support myself I'm going to find a way not to have my auto my taken at 57 and into the coming years. Somehow there's got to be a way to not be gaslighted and not even told of your diagnosis and things placed and coded in to your records that ruin your life and choices. I cannot stand finding out what I know now and I am sad and disappointed in the process of ""care"" and treatment..it all ends terribly

2025-11-08 02:25:01;I don't know what's wrong.;"Hello, I feel very vulnerable talking on reddit of all places but I don't care anymore. I'm 17 years old girl, I'm a bit chubby, and I hate the way my face looks. 
I was a kid from a teen mother and a 20 year old man. I grew up with two sisters and a dog, my father was very abusive and my mother was a push over, when my dad cheated on my mom when I was in 5th grade it seriously impacted me because even though my father was abusive, I still loved him. I don't have any friends, I have a habit of falling for any affection shown to me even if I don't fully love the other. I guess you could say I love being loved? Anyways, I was diagnosed with MDD and social anxiety in my sophomore year, I experienced the deaths of two of my cats in front of my very eyes. These experiences seriously traumatized me and I didn't graduate 8th grade because of one. My entire sophomore year I never showed up for more than a week and that got me in a lot of trouble. I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed BPD because I get severely irritated at anyone and anything, which is why I choose not to have friends because I dont want to be the buzzkill who ruins it. When my two cats died, I developed extreme suicidal thoughts and I had a failed attempt getting ready for school. I was taking a bath when i blanked and put myself underwater, which is something I'm terrified of because a childhood experience. I failed because I got so scared and I reported myself, where I was sent to a holding center for three days. I didn't like it there, so I faked getting better to get out. When I'm in school, I have terrible thoughts and I need music to keep myself focused, I was put on a 504 plan and I got slightly better. I was put on medicine for my MDD, but failed to continue them because I got impatient of the medication not working (I know it takes time, I just wanted to be cured as quick as possible which I know is impossible) I haven't attended any proms or even my senior sunrise. I like art, I've been drawing since kindergarten but lately my will to continue it has plummeted. I'm an early grad, which means I'll finish with HS credits in December, teachers ask me how I feel about it, and I can't feel anything. I start college in January, I want to major in art to get skills to become a tattoo artist. I'm stressing now because of the way the government and economy is right now. Anytime I think about becoming an adult I get scared and almost puke. Today I was supposed to get up for school, but I had a moment the night before and I cried myself to sleep quietly ranting about ending my life. When I woke up I felt worse, and I felt like I needed to tell someone I needed help. I waited until my mom came in to get me up and I started crying, I didn't know how to tell her because the previous times I have she's just been dismissive. I finally worked up the courage to tell her I need help and she just said ""what are you stressed about? You don't have bills or responsibilities?"" And I felt dismissed, like my feelings weren't valid without a proper reason. I've been stressed about college, my future, but this started because Im frustrated at my sister's for not cleaning their mess even though I have messes of my own in my room. I'm sitting on the floor writing this, I've just cleaned my closet out and picked my room up. I struggle with my self imagine. I feel sick in my own body, and have been questioning my identity since 7th grade.

I've been battling depression for quite some time now, I've had the diagnosis for two years, but I've had the symptoms for much longer... Now, I simply don't know what to do.

2025-11-08 01:29:54;Anxiety + Depression + Couples Problems + Being a Mom;"I don’t really know where to start, but I just need to vent and see if anyone else relates.

I’ve always been an anxious person and an overthinker, so anxiety has basically been part of my personality. But everything got a lot worse in the last few years.

About 5 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and schizoaffective disorder in her late 40s. Since then, she’s had several mixed episodes, and every time it happens, my anxiety gets unbearable. She lives overseas, so I feel this constant mix of guilt, fear, and helplessness. I’m always scared of the next phone call.

Last October I had a baby, and my mom came to visit. She ended up having a full mixed episode and was hospitalized in a psych ward for about a month and a half. She flew back home, and just a few months later, she had another episode. I send money every week because my grandma is the one caring for her now, and the weight of that responsibility never shuts off in my mind.

On top of that, I’ve been struggling in my marriage. I’ve been with my husband for 10 years, and everyone sees him as this “perfect husband” because he doesn’t cheat and isn’t abusive. And to be fair... he is a great dad, we both work full-time, and he genuinely helps with the kids. They’re not all on me, and I appreciate that. But emotionally, I feel completely alone. When I forget things (because my mind is overwhelmed 24/7), he gets mad instead of trying to understand. And when I cry, he tells me to “go cry in the room where no one sees you.” That kind of thing chips away at you over time.

For years I’ve been asking him to be more emotionally supportive, and nothing changes. Recently, I asked for couples therapy and he said he doesn’t believe in therapy... that anxiety/depression is just something you “push through” by staying busy. I also tried to suggest a trip for just the two of us to reconnect, even just a few days, and he said no because he didn’t want to leave the kids (even though his mom and sister are amazing with them). Then I suggested a couples trip with my cousins... same answer.

Meanwhile, I’m having panic attacks at work and at night when I try to sleep. I’ve fallen into depression for the first time in my life. I take care of my kids, and then I just isolate in my room because I feel like I have nothing left. I finally started individual therapy, and the therapist told me that because he comes from divorced parents, it’s easy for him to throw around the word divorce when we argue... and because I also come from divorced parents, I’ve been internalizing it as a real option. But this isn’t something I thought of overnight. I’ve tried for years, and I’m exhausted.

The truth is: I don’t feel good with him emotionally anymore. I asked for a divorce because I just want peace. He thinks there’s someone else, but the thought of dating anyone literally makes me sick. I don’t even want to be with him.

Now suddenly, because I finally said I was done, he says he wants therapy and wants to fix things... but I feel like I’m past the breaking point. And I feel guilty. Because he is a good man and an amazing dad… just not a good partner to me anymore. I don’t hate him. I just don’t feel loved, supported, or understood. And now I feel guilty for wanting to leave, even though I’m fully willing to co-parent and don’t want to make his life miserable.

I’m also scared that what happened to my mom might happen to me someday. The anxiety, the depression, the mental instability... it’s all too close.

I guess I just needed to let this out. I haven’t felt peace in months, and I don't know what to do anymore. If anyone else has gone through something like this... mentally ill parent + new baby + relationship unraveling + crippling anxiety... I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

P.S -> I have an appointment with a psychiatrist to get some anxiety meds and see what else hes gonna say.";r/depression;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1or0mkm/anxiety_depression_couples_problems_being_a_mom/
2025-11-08 00:42:39;Failed and hopeless;"I really feel life is not for me, moreover i am going to turn 25 this month, the idea to end my life is getting stronger and stronger than before moreover when some triggers happened

I'm female from southeast asian country, left home alone at 18 to germany, hated my childhood and family whole life. I was very hyperactive as kid and became quiet and passive since 12. Always daydreaming everyday for hours and even whole day

At 18-22 working various random food jobs i didnt like, then go to prep college, 3 year unfinished bachelors in 3 different schools due to lack of concentration and juggle between random shift gastronomy jobs, then now reset bachelor again from 0 and in new city. Been living in 8 different cities and states in Germany due to multiple reasons and never enjoyed or planned to change things every year

I tried everything to be able to concentrate to study, pomodoro timer, going to library everyday, attend lecture everyday. Seriously, i just couldnt pay attention

Never believed on adhd, depression and all psychological stuffs, i thought i will change someday when i am adult. Now i'm 25 and nothing is changed. I just want to be able to study, finish, work in field i want which is programming. I could coding for 10-20hours straight once i started but to start a task is very hard

Went to psychologist for adhd and she referred me to hausarzt/GP and diagnosed depression for me. Hausarzt gave me 10mg escitalopram for 3 months, i took everyday and not feeling anything.

I tried one time 40mg methylpenidate from a friend. I was so surprised that it was literally the first time of my life feeling no racing thoughts, being ""present"" in this world, no multiple thoughts or things on my mind on every second, when someone is talking i can 100% concentrate on him talking, i can talk while looking people in the eyes, not moving my body every second. If there is distraction can easily ""shut"" it off and just stop thinking about it. Thats crazy and i feel like a functional human

Then i decided to pay for private adhd online diagnosis despite of my very lack of money, got the diagnosis in the end and also the psychiatrist who diagnosed me told me 10mg escitalopram is too low since my BDI scores are the highest. 

I went to Hausarzt and he asked me to take half of escitalopram for 2 weeks and stop it. Because maybe it's because of adhd and he cant prescribed it. It must be psychiatrist and he wrote referral to psychiatrist.

I paid to online private clinic again for private prescription for almost 100€, got lisdexamfetamine 20mg almost €70

Took it for a week now. And not feeling anything. I was very mad and feeling hopeless. I really couldnt study and have lots of things to catch up

Today i went to public psychiatrist that i booked 2 months ago and almost 2 hours away from city i lived, told him evrything and hoping he could give me lisdexamfetamine or methylpenidate with higher dose with public insurance prescription. He told me lisdexamfetamine 20mg is too low and prescribe me bupropion instead and see next month if there's any effect

I was just following him but i am very disappointed because i dont thing bupropion will also work, maybe its just like useless escitalopram. And he also gave me lowest dose which is 150mg.

Why is so hard just to give methylpenidate and i only used it for studying not for fun or recreation. I also need to find part time job to cover my expenses now and 2 hours ago i have interview in a supermarkt but i was too nervous and couldnt explain clearly my shit backgrounds (various jobs in various cities, 2 ausbildung,3 colleges, all unfinished). I am sure they wont hire me and i will get rejection email tomorrow or next week

I am very stupid and i want to end my life. I dont have any support system, mentally and financially. I want to be useful human being, positive vibes, contribute but i dont think i can reach to that point. Any ideas how to end life? Should i just pack my stuffs, donate all, manage the bureaucracy, end rent contract, close bank account

I never have good sleeps and always feeling tired and brain fog. I also have bruxism or teeth grinding since last year while i was sleeping and i noticed my side tooth shorter, i didnt even know it. Someone recorded me while i was sleeping and im making loud sounds like pepper grinder

I tried everything, melatonin, sleep before 11, all is not working

How do you get any kind of help? What are the EXACT steps? What kind of provider do you see first? Second? Third? 

I've tried seeing the therapist first getting a diagnosis, then going to a psychiatrist for meds. That was horrible. Started over. Went to 3 different kinds of psychologist, a behavioral & an educational. Got 2 different diagnosises from them. After that, nothing. Thousands of emails to be told ""we can't help witt that"". 

So, starting over again. What are the precise steps to getting an accurate diagnosis & treatment?

I'm so fucking sick of trying to figure out who does what. I wish there was one person / office I could walk in to that would just help me, instead of me having to try to figure out the whole therapy vs psychology vs psychiatry whatever. It doesn't work like this at all but the type of provider who can manage all of it doesn't exist & I'm fucking tired.

2025-11-07 20:07:04;I thought I had it under control;"For context, I fought with major depression for a solid 20 years of my life. All day, every day, all I could think about was ending it. I got health insurance, got diagnosed and medicated, and things seemed to be going pretty well for a few years. Anyway, it's back and it's really bad. It feels like my meds have been replaced with skittles for all the good they're doing.

2025-11-07 18:05:41;Is it turning into depression?;"I’m dealing with **anxiety and sadness** and honestly, I don’t know how to manage it anymore. (F25)

I’ve always been a c**alm person, someone who could handle serious situations** and always be there for others. But after my ex left, everything crumbled.

The past three years have been **mentally exhausting** for me. In chronological order (because when it rains, it really pours…), here’s what happened.

My two younger brothers, one after the other, went through **psychological distress** for different reasons. One has a mental disorder and became completely dependent on me, and the other had suicidal thoughts. I didn’t tell my parents anything and tried to help them on my own, as best as I could. After months, things eventually got better.

Then, after a lifetime of saying “I don’t want love,” I finally got into a relationship with a guy who ended up **cheating** on me. Looking back now, I can laugh about it and even feel grateful that it ended the way it did, but at the time it was a huge emotional hit.

A year later, I started feeling like I was getting back to myself, and… my mother was diagnosed with stage IV **cancer**. She’s currently in treatment.

Then I met another guy. We were together for two years, and he was the first person I ever told **“I love you”** to. To be with him, I lost three mutual friends and, as a result, a whole group I was really close to. **I truly loved this guy**, and I thought he loved me. He made me discover **love**. But over time, he turned **into someone I didn’t recognize**. He manipulated me (unintentionally, I believe) and made me feel guilty for things I shouldn’t have. We broke up a few months ago, and I’m still devastated. My family and friends thought I was in danger of **emotional abuse** (unintentionally, I believe).

Throughout all of this, I’ve realized that **my job is draining me**. I used to be the “talented” one, but now **I feel mediocre**. I’m not as exceptional as everyone once thought. I hate my job, which is actually the result of everything I’ve studied for.

Out of nowhere, I started having **chest pains, shortness of breath, and dissociation.** I’ve become so **distracted**, and I’m constantly fighting back **tears** every day. It’s been going on for six months now, and it’s really starting to **affect my life**: I can’t even enjoy horseback riding anymore because my anxiety makes the poor animal anxious too. At work, I make mistakes and feel more and more frustrated and on edge.

I’ve been in therapy for a while, but my therapist **hasn’t fully grasped** how serious this has become, and I plan to tell her. Like many people in my life, she’s idealized me. Also, it’s worth mentioning that my father’s entire family has struggled with mental health issues, particularly depression, so it’s s**omething that runs in the family.** My family and closest friends are doing **everything they can to keep me from sinking**, and I love them so much for that.

**But I honestly don’t know how to climb back up.**

2025-11-07 17:36:53;Does anyone else feel like mental health terms are being misused on social media?;"
I don’t know if I’m the only one noticing this, but social media is turning real mental health conditions into trends or personality traits, and it’s getting hard to watch. Every day I see people calling completely normal behaviors autistic, calling being neat OCD, calling being sad for a day depressed, or calling shyness social anxiety. Meanwhile, people who actually struggle with these disorders get erased because the internet has turned these terms into aesthetics, vibes, or labels for identity.

People will literally say things like “I’m autistic because I don’t like loud noises,” or “I have OCD because I color-code my closet,” or “I’m depressed because I lay in bed sometimes.” That’s not how any of that works. Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition. OCD is a cycle of intrusive thoughts and compulsions that force behavior. Depression is not “feeling sad sometimes”it affects appetite, executive function, hygiene, energy, and the ability to perform basic daily tasks. But TikTok has made self-diagnosis into a personality category.

And the thing is, I actually do have anxiety and depression. I’ve lived through times where I couldn’t function in my ADLs. When my room or my bathroom gets messy, that’s not “quirky,” that’s me not okay. That’s my mental state showing. Watching people use these words casually feels disrespectful. Like they get to perform a disorder, while others have to live with one.

This also ties into how people talk about “Mental Health Day” culture. Sometimes it feels like people use “mental health day” to just mean they didn’t feel like going to work that day. But for people with actual mental illness, a mental health day is not a cute spa break. It’s not candles and journaling. It’s not self-care playlists. Sometimes it’s not being able to get out of bed. It’s forcing yourself to shower when your body feels like cement. It’s going quiet because your brain is shutting down just to survive. It’s standing in the kitchen for thirty minutes because your brain can’t choose a plate. That’s what it looks like in reality.

So I guess my real question is: has social media made mental health seem trendy instead of serious? Has it turned disorders into aesthetic identities to the point where real struggle gets ignored? I genuinely want to know if anyone else sees this happening, or if I’m alone in thinking this.";r/mentalhealth;5;7;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqq2sv/does_anyone_else_feel_like_mental_health_terms/

History: 
-3 unaliving attempts between 15-18. 
-previous auditory and visual hallucinations
-diagnosed with bipolar disorder (never given a type and my med records say full remission whatever that means?) anxiety, depression w psychotic features, PTSD and at one point schizoaffective disorder. 

I'm in EMDR DBT therapy for my PTSD currently. I had a baby 8 months ago, started therapy around 6 months ago.

I'm having worsening auditory hallucinations, extreme anxiety leaving the house, i'm convinced everyone around me (including in my home) hates me or has it out for me. My most persistent hallucination is hearing sirens... and I mean constant. police. sirens. I'm not sleeping. I'm not eating. Leaving the house and putting on a show for the people around me is way too fucking hard anymore. I do nothing but check every single camera I have (two outside, two indoors) to make sure i'm really ""just crazy."" 

Is this schizophrenia? Is this DID? DID is what my therapist is constantly exploring with me through parts work due to my trauma... 

Any insight to either of these diagnoses would be so helpful. I just don't want to feel alone anymore, not that I'm alone because everyone's constantly watching me. 😭

2025-11-07 11:55:18;Can’t get out of bed..;"Hi, idk how to make this short. Seems like a lot.. I recently found out that I have ADHD - inattentive type at 30 years old. I’m also a female, my doc said that type is very common in women. Apparently I’ve had it most of my life. It was a tough thing to learn about myself. It was good because now I know my problem and I can start treating it to get better, and it was bad because I’ve gone my whole life starting and never finishing things and constantly quitting. I feel like I’ve wasted 30 years of my life. So I feel like that’s adding on to my depression if that makes sense. 

I started taking adderall a week ago. It definitely helps me stay focused and awake/aware, but that’s about it. It doesn’t help me get up in the morning and get to work. I was naively thinking it would help me with that. I wish I could be like normal people and just start the day, but that alone is a huge task for me. I wake up in a weird mood everyday. I don’t want to get up and start the day, I just want to stay in bed and sleep more. Sometimes I tell myself that I just want to sleep until I’m not sleepy anymore, but maybe that’s not possible. I slept about 14hrs yesterday, kind of using sleep as an excuse to avoid life. But I’m also very confused about it because I don’t understand why the hell I’m so sleepy all the time. I recently got labs done and have low iron. Not extremely low. Doc wants me taking iron every other day. Everything else seems fine. So per my pcp and psychiatrist, it seems like I have depression. I did multiple evals and they diagnosed me with depression and ADHD multiple times. I just have the fear of starting antidepressants and not being able to get off of them when I need it or even the possibility of them making me a “zombie” like I hear a lot of people talking about. I feel like I’m already behaving like a zombie with me not being able to get out of bed, but during all of this, I’m still me. I like being me but I guess I really need to change. 

I just want something that will help me get out of bed in the morning and start the day. Is that something that any of you have struggled with? Have your meds helped with that at all? I’ve lost the past few weeks of paychecks because I just can’t get up. I’ve tried sleeping super early, I’ve tried sleep all day the day before work, I’ve tried energy drinks and focus gummies and now adderall. Adderall is helpful. I worked well for a couple days with it but now I’m back to the point where I just can’t get out of bed and it’s ruining my life. I’m ruining my life. So upset with myself. 

I have another appointment with my psychiatrist Monday and just want to be prepared. He says he wants me to try antidepressants. I hope I can be fixed somehow. It feels like I can’t do it alone and will definitely need meds. But have any of you experienced this and had success with any meds? I’m not asking for medical advice or anything..

2025-11-07 11:15:43;Does depression ever really get better? What kind of additional treatments for CPTSD and treatment resistant MDD are there that is actually helpful for people? (Other then medication and psychotherapy);"TW:  suicide, abuse, self harm

I really really want to get better. I need to get better becuase I need to stay alive. For the longest time I was not willing to put in the effort to get better, but I am willing to do anything to feel happier. I just dont know how to do that.

I have been struggling with severe MDD, unspecified eating disorder, bpd, adhd and RAD. COVID is really what set off my depression, self harm and active suicidal thoughts. I had very abusive parents my whole childhood (physical and emotional) but during COVID, I had no escape whatsoever, my mental health went down. I had always been a sad and quiet and passively suicidal because of what happened at home, with the thought that it would get better one day, but when I was 15 it all got worse and I began to stop having hope. I also ran away when I was 15 and was kidnapped and raped.

I have been in inpatient hospitals/residentials for majority of the past 4 years. Ive had multiple suicide attempts, with the most recent one being I jumped off a freeway overpass into a freeway. I can no longer run or play sports because of that or walk for more then 20 minutes without being in pain. I have been self harming since I was 15, but the frequency has gone down a lot from daily to none in over 100 days.

I have been on about 20 or so different medications, and none of them in my opinion helped me to feel better. I often feel emotionally numb and detached and I rarely ever feel happy. I have periods of time where I am at my baseline (which is sad) to extremely hopeless and suicidal. These last sometimes only an hour or so to a couple weeks. I often restrict and purge to try to control my body weight, but I have noticed that the more controlled I feel that less I eat. I am very shy and it is hard for me to talk to people that I dont know at all because I overthink everything that I am doing and dont feel like I am good enough. Relationships are very scary because I am not used to trusting anyone or expecting anyone to stay. I always expect people to hurt me because that is what has always happened in the past. I am very jumpy and often have nightmares about my childhood.

I thought that I was only depressed because of my situation at home, but when I was removed from my parents home, I still had the same symptoms. When I started college, I still felt the same way after 2 years straight of being in residentials and hospitals. I had tried many medications and had a lot of therapy. Since I still felt the same in college, I got truly hopeless and had a serious suicide attempt. I had therapy sessions during those 2 years and after my attempt last year I spent almost another year in treatment. Nothing has really helped. And this 4 month gap is almost the longest I have gone without being hospitalized for the past 4 years.

Mainstream ways of treating depression and my other diagnosis is medication and therapy. Neither of those has helped me. I still feel suicidal and numb and sad all the time. I am just wondering if there is anything that could possibly help me. Are there any other treatments that could help? I have heard of TMS and ECT for depression and EMDR for ptsd, but I haven't tried that yet due to the cost. I really just want to get better and I want to live. I dont want to end my dying due to myself. I want to get better and make a better life for myself despite what happened to me, but I truly don't know how anymore.

I was just upset because my friend boyfriend ruined my birthday and broke my windshield and when I called the police, they decided with him and gave him a ride home rather than pressing charges for him destroying my property because“that’s what insurance is for“. But because I was upset because this man ruined my birthday and shattered my windshield I was sent to the fruit farm on my birthday.

I lost my job five months ago, I’m drowning in debt, I’m about to lose my car, I’m about to lose all of my belongings in storage because that’s where I had to put everything when I lost my housing. I want to get help. I know I need impatient treatment . But without a job or insurance the only place I can go is where I went when I was baker acted. I would not send a stray rabbit, mangy dog there. I sat in admission for 16 hours without food, freezing to death. When I finally was “admitted” I was only allowed a hospital gown. They kept the floor like 56°. It was freezing. When I woke up, I tried to take my blanket and they wouldn’t let me have it. It’s a very small facility. There was one TV that had on kids shows. I’m asthmatic and I was denied an inhaler and when I asked the nurse for access to inhaler and she could hear me visibly wheezing I was berated and belittled. There was patients who were in psychosis walking up and down the halls, talking to themselves smacking themselves.

The food… The one girl I talked to in there said jail food was better. It was a very traumatic experience. The only reason I was sent there was because of an asshole cop. How does someone get away with vandalizing and clearly destroying someone’s property who is hammered get a ride home and the person who was driving them to their home but stopped on the side of the road to call for help once this person became aggressive and destroyed their property get sent to the fruit farm?

Florida 

I’m about to take the sewer slide ride. I sleep all day and I’m up all night. I have no energy. I have no motivation. I cry all the time. My room is a disgusting hoarder pigsty. I’ve reached out to my family and they don’t care. I don’t have any friends. I am so alone. I would not wish this life on my worst enemy. I used to be so happy and full of life and a good mom. All I do now is cry…I can’t live like this anymore. I won’t go back there. And there’s no place around me that will take anyone with no insurance.

2025-11-07 09:29:20;"Family Member & Best Friend of 30 Years ""Broke Up"" With Me and I Don't Know What to Do";"There is a member of my family I have known almost my entire life and we've always basically been best friends. We would watch movies & shows together, play video games together, and over-analyze all of our favorite media. Even after I moved an hour away, we would still have frequent hours-long phone conversations and take time to drive to see each other and hang out as much as we could in our spare time.

To make a long story somewhat shorter, my friend was diagnosed with a chronic condition that upended their life and caused them to move back in with their parents. About a year and a half ago, they started acting different - randomly yelling at me and my partner out of nowhere when they would come to visit, insisting that I'm stuck up and not that smart, saying that no one 'gets things' or are as 'spiritual' as they are. I got together with their parents and planned an intervention - we suspected my friend may have stopped taking their antidepressants or started taking something else that was causing these sudden outbursts. The intervention didn't go great - my friend wasn't receptive to it in any way and told us all to leave them alone. So, I made sure their parents had access to resources and phone numbers in case things got worse, and we dropped it.

After that, things seemed like they were slowly getting better. I had my own medical scare and my own diagnosis with a chronic condition that required some intense surgery and recovery time. During this time, my friend tried to help out and be there as much as they could. Around the start of summer, I started working on slowly getting back to work and normalcy. I tried to go back to hanging out with my friend like we had before my surgery, and it went well for a while. But then in September they suddenly got very distant with me. When I pressed them on what was going on, they said ""your life is just too miserable for me"" and ""I hate you actually."" Then they said, ""This is weird - I'm kind of breaking up with you."" (Reminder, we are blood relatives in a fully platonic relationship. The way they said this sounded very gross and inappropriate.) Since this conversation, they have cut me out of their life as much as possible. They also recently quit their job, barely leave the house, and their parents tell me they seemingly have no other friends.

I'm looking for some advice on what to do. Dealing with all this has had a seriously negative effect on my mental and physical well-being. I don't know if my friend is having their own mental health crisis, or if I actually am as awful as they seem to think I am. I also don't know how to help them if they ARE in a crisis, as I have seemingly been removed from their HIPPA and can no longer contact their health team (I had previously been added to their HIPPA during treatment for their chronic health condition). There is familial history of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, but my friend has recently been very insistent that there isn't anything wrong with them. Their parents have kicked family out of the house before, so I'm scared it could potentially happen to my friend as well, and they have nowhere else to go. I can't just abandon them. But I don't know how I should move forward. Does anyone have any advice?";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqha8o/family_member_best_friend_of_30_years_broke_up/
2025-11-07 08:57:11;lowkey worried abt my s/o.;so me and my partner (both nb18) have been together for 3 years now and are in a long term serious relationship. we both are diagnosed with MDD, autism, and ADHD and i am diagnosed with BPD as well so this can make us have struggles but we are more than willing to help each other overcome them and our relationship is very healthy despite our mental health not being as much. the thing that worries me is they are seeming to be getting worse lately. they are being less open with me about how they feel and are being sort of distant not just from me but from everyone. i know they are relapsing and they wont tell me but i know. they also told me a few times that they are tired of trying to be happy and are just giving up. ive felt this way too and im so willing to help but im afraid of coming across as insincere because i know how annoying it is to hear people tell you to stay and that youre loved etc... but like i just dont wanna lose them and im worried and they say theyre done trying then the next minute they say theyre fine, idk i just care about them so freaking much and i cry all the time because i feel like im failing them and not good enough or making them happy enough like i should be despite them making me feel happy and loved i just feel like im not doing enough. they also said they cant wait to fully finish the video game were making together so they can finally die. now i dont even wanna help with it anymore despite it being our project weve been working on for over a year, im just thinking what if we finish it then they unalive themselves or something i probably would have to as well and ik that sounds extreme but like genuinely i cannot live without them and even moreso cant live with the fact that that sort of thing happened and i let it happen, i couldnt clean out their room or go to their funeral or be constantly given condolences by people or hug their parents i couldnt do it. they told me im the only reason they stay and im so fucking scared i will do something to ruin that. im not perfect myself and i dont want to hurt them all i want is for them to be happy, but its almost like being happy is the second option if that makes sense. ive attempted a few times its not fun and obviously im not going to understand what theyre going through 100% but i think if anyone does its me and i just want them to open up to me because i can help them and i would go through great lengths to give them the love they deserve and it breaks me to the point i think im also starting to get drained as well. i also feel bad for being happy around them because i dont want them to think im pretending to be depressed or something idk. anyways sorry for ranting so much but im just so lost in this and i need advice on what to do moving forward and how to deal with this please and thanks ^^;r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqgks3/lowkey_worried_abt_my_so/
2025-11-07 08:53:48;When do I get to recover from burnout?;"TLDR; I had a traumatic childhood and am now an adult burnt out on life.   
  
I guess I will start by saying this is going to be a super long post, and I am mainly just venting. I don't expect one random Redditor to give me advice to solve all my problems or make my life any easier. 

I grew up in a really harsh environment, homelessness, drugs, violence, abuse, all of that. I have had a job since before I was legally allowed to (now 22m). I worked pretty much full-time through college and high school while playing sports for most of it, yet I got past all of that fine somehow. I graduated from college last May. I have a beautiful girlfriend who is supportive and caring. We live together. I had a job making a good amount of money and could pay our rent and other bills.  
  
 I quit today and ruined it all because I couldn't bear to go into that office one more day, and I can't bear to start filling out applications. I don't want to work; I want to recover from life. It doesn't seem like that is an option   


It all feels like the most insurmountable task. I feel like I have been an adult since I can remember. I have had to deal with real adult problems since I can remember. I want and need a break, not from work, but from life itself. The very act of living feels so difficult. It always has, really, and I have ALWAYS risen to the challenge, and I took great pride in that. Recently, though, it all feels a little more pointless, and I couldn't tell you why. I have everything I could ask for: Someone who loves me, somewhere nice to live, and still it all feels so difficult. Honestly, mentally, this is the hardest it's ever been. I keep setting goals, whether it was moving out of my parents after college, or getting that prestigious job. I tell myself that it'll make the days easier, make the hard work more worth it, but at what point does life no longer feel like a challenge? 

I quit my job because the stress was giving me migraines, but now I have the stress of finding a new job before my savings run out. Also, there is no guarantee that the next job I get will put any less stress on me. It feels as though I have nothing left in my cup to pour and no amount of working out, walking/running outside, lifitng weights, drawing, journaling, or video games refills my cup. 

I am not going to do anything crazy. I enjoy many parts of life, but none of them are easy. I know comparison is the theif of joy, and I am ahead of a lot of my peers. Yet, they all find it easier than me. They find going to work, living their life, and existing genuinely more enjoyable than I do or ever have. These aren't people I see post on social media either, they are close friends I have known for years. 

I have been to therapy, and it is always either silly brain tricks or them trying to put me on SSRIs. My anxiety is physical in this strange way. I don't think about my problems and get anxiety, my body crumbles, and I have to figure out which problem is making my chest tight, giving me heart palpitations, or making me all clammy. I got diagnosed with CPSTD and other things, but knowing what's wrong with me doesn't help me manage it. 

I refuse to take SSRIs because I have watched so many people around me start taking them and turn into different people entirely, or a shell of who they were. 

ok, that's all. I am done, thanks for letting me vent, Reddit. Feel free to give advice or share your experiences. ";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqgi37/when_do_i_get_to_recover_from_burnout/
2025-11-07 08:44:47;ADHD + trauma, made me my own worst critic;"Hey y'all, I'm looking for some guidance so I don't get stuck in analysis paralysis by watching every video that even remotely relates to my problems. I was an ADHD ""gifted kid"" and for all of my childhood I was praised for being ""smart but just lazy"". I assumed I had ADHD around when I was 13 but because my parents didn't really believe me, I did not get officially diagnosed until last year. I am 22 now and being medicated has drastically changed my life for the better, at least when it comes to daily functioning, discipline, and being able to perform academically.

Unfortunately, due to several traumatic incidents/environments throughout my childhood and most of my adult life - constant bullying and abuse from ages 7-19, both verbal and physical, from peers, teachers, and my father; in relationships just over this past year, I was ghosted by a first love type partner, my next ex after that was SAd; long term pornography consumption from a young age negatively affecting how I view my partners and other women around me, making me quite a lustful person; poor/chaotic relationship with other addictive substances or mediums - (this is just some) I feel I have developed certain behaviors that hinder the overall quality of my life and still limit me from living my best life.

My biggest is that I am deeply insecure and overanalyze every micro interaction to the point that it exhausts me. I am unable to ever feel ""good enough"" and no matter the amount of progress I make, I still beat myself up over the simplest mistakes leading to burning out faster/easier. I have been in therapy for a few months now, and am proud to say I have made a lot of progress on these issues, but I am still far from where I would like to be (we have recently begin experimenting with CBT and the ACT model). I have been engaging in good habits and behaviors for the past few months and hope to keep that consistency. I'm just really exhausted of being unable to give myself grace and love myself along the journey to the goals I have set for myself and not just when I eventually reach them.

I want to get rid of that overbearing self-critic that is so clearly persistent for no other reason other than that trauma and past ""failures"". I would like to develop a model through which I can understand everything that goes on in my head so I can stop overthinking why I am feeling a certain way or why a certain thought popped up in my head. Sorry for the long message, I hope someone can part some advice and is able direct me to some resources that would help.

2025-11-07 08:41:17;Want to help others, but I can't help myself;"TW: Self-harm, sewerslide  
  
When I was starting high school, I realized both of my parents were diagnosed with schizophrenia--my mother was also epileptic and my dad's bipolar--and that explained a lot of what I experienced. Before I graduated I was homeless for about a month during my Freshman year, my mother told me she wanted to take her own life/wanted to die and then succeeded several months into my Sophomore year, and my father was in and out of prison. With everything I experienced I decided I wanted to help people like myself who were dealt a bad hand in life.

And then, I became depressed. Motivation was, all of a sudden, difficult to find.

Right around when COVID lockdown happened I was in my Sophomore/Junior year of college working towards an education degree. The way I saw it at the time, I could help students in high school like myself once I had my education credentials. However, my part-time job at the time put a spotlight on a lot of the hardships people were going through. I saw my manager fall down and cry behind the register, overwhelmed by rude customers and their rising medical costs. My coworkers and I joked about how we'd never afford houses nearly every day. My friends who started teaching explained how broken the system had become, sharing horror stories about students who were illiterate in the 8th grade. Everyone spoke about their declining mental health, and people I knew who stayed silent were clearly suffering in their own way. I decided if I wanted to help people, I had to focus on fundamental issues, and I shifted my focus over to social work or counseling. 

I took a step in that direction earlier this year, volunteering for an overseas aid program. A combination of US politics I don't want to get into, and the realization that I wasn't actually helping anyone in that program (I saw people living in poverty like you wouldn't believe, but the program's primary aim was to teach people about how great America is... I stopped believing America was great years before that) led to me calling our medical team for help. I shared that I was feeling very depressed, was thinking about harming myself, and needed a way to relieve my stress. They flew me home the next day.

When I arrived back in town, I got a call from family I was staying with, they told me I couldn't stay there anymore. Ended up on a friend's couch while he was in the hospital, he came home that night and explained that he now has a hospital bill he couldn't afford. Eventually I ended up living with my Dad in his one bedroom apartment after years of trying to keep away from him. My twisted fate landed me back with my abuser, essentially.

So now I'm here trying to get back on my feet. I wake up every day, upset that I woke up, and I lay in bed every night hoping to feel better tomorrow. I think about game ending myself often, even at my part-time job, and whenever I try and make plans for the future I realize how bleak everything is. For example, a recent political move made it so my college tuition is now unaffordable with federal loans, I'm financially unable to work towards my counseling degree thanks to a government decision. One year ago, I could afford it. Now? That option is next to impossible, but I'm trying. I don't qualify for Social Work anymore due to a string of bad luck (my 'mentor' who was my #1 recommender has been publicly disgraced and is being investigated for fraud) and stricter requirements, not that Social Work is a desirable career path given the state of the world right now.

But I can't think of anything else I'd want to do, I want nothing more than to help people, but it feels like I can't find a way to do it and whenever I'm focusing on myself I feel miserable. However, I don't have a lot of options anymore. Most of my family quite literally sees me as a burden, hates my father because of his illness, or hates being around me because they feel guilt over what happened with my mom. Yet, I need help. 

I don't know where I can reach out for help at this point. I'm young (in my mid-late 20s) and I have a bachelors degree, but I feel so miserable it's difficult holding a job. When driving to my previous job, I daydreamed about turning into oncoming traffic. But when I'm at work helping someone, I feel great and fulfilled. It's just that right now all of my job prospects are awful, and even though I am motivated to attend college... it's too expensive!

Thanks for reading, and if anyone knows of any resources I can look into for free/reduced counseling or therapy, that'd really help me a lot. It won't solve everything, but it'd at least give me a bit of support while I work on figuring out how I can move forward instead of being stuck.";r/depression;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqg854/want_to_help_others_but_i_cant_help_myself/

2025-11-07 07:21:22;I think I’ve reached the point where pain just feels normal now;"I’m a 31-year-old guy living abroad, and I just needed to share this somewhere, because keeping it all inside is slowly crushing me.

Earlier this year, I went through a breakup that completely shattered me. I begged and pleaded for her to stay, but she walked away like I never mattered. What destroyed me most was how quickly she moved on within two weeks she had already replaced me, sharing her “new life” online, seeking validation from strangers, acting like the last few years meant nothing.

While she was doing that, my world was falling apart. My mom had a stroke, my dad had an accident that left him struggling to walk, and my sister was diagnosed with leukemia. I lost her in July. I felt like life was punishing me for something I didn’t even do.

And yet through all that, I still tried to be the good guy helping my family financially, keeping my job together, and forcing a smile just to survive another day. But deep down, I’ve felt this mix of heartbreak, betrayal, and emptiness that I can’t even put into words.

I’m not looking for pity. I just needed to be honest for once. It hurts when someone you loved so deeply throws you away like you never existed and then you have to somehow keep living, working, and pretending you’re okay while they’re out there acting like nothing ever happened.

People say karma comes back, or that everything happens for a reason. But I’m not sure anymore. I used to believe in love, and I used to believe in fairness but now I’m not sure what to believe in at all.

If anyone’s ever had their heart broken that deeply  when it felt like your entire identity collapsed  how did you rebuild? How did you start believing again? Because right now, I’m just existing .";r/depression;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqecr1/i_think_ive_reached_the_point_where_pain_just/

2025-11-07 05:11:46;I'm such a waste;"I'm 26 and I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 13. For half of my life I've had this heavy, aching weight inside of my chest. I've been a looming mist in other people's lives, filling the empty air with half-hearted plans and unkept promises. 

I'm in tens of thousands in debt from student loans and no degree to show for it. I've dropped out/taken leaves on and off since finishing my first semester of college, all for mental health reasons: eating disorder, alcoholism. Upon my most recent return (after a 5 year hiatus) I was really determined to finally finish what I started. This year felt like *the one*. I finally left an abusive 4-year relationship, I reassessed my priorities, and I started doing what's best for me. Then, after my first week of classes I was drugged, kidnapped, and raped by my coworker who is twice my age. Boom. Back to square one, again. Now I am out of a job and on another leave from school, waiting for a break in my case because my rapist is nowhere to be found. What the fuck do I do? I can't cope anymore. 

I just can't to do it. I don't want to keep trying, the more I try the more I feel myself digging deeper into a hole of debt and doubt for nothing. I feel like a sham and a waste. I see my older sister with her master's degree and 6-figure job, I see my cousin in his microbiology PhD program, I see all my college friends with their degrees, newer friends with established jobs, and it all hurts that I can't be that. I'm lost. I'm indecisive. I'm incapable. I've job hopped around 8 jobs in the past 5 years, I can't settle and I can't just be content. I never finish what I start. I'm stuck in this rut, the same rut I've been in since before I can even remember. I don't trust myself to pick a path that is right for me anymore. I keep hitting walls instead of finding a door and I want to give up trying so I can at least get used to the disappointment. 

This is my daily spiral. Today, it is especially overwhelming.

2025-11-07 04:57:09;Too scared to tell my phycatrist how I really feel;"Im not new to mental health, ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety from the age of 11 years old. Since then I have seen several phycatrists, psychologist, and therapist. Im not 30 years old and have had a range of diagnosis from depression, anxiety, bipolar 2, bad, autism, adhd, and I feel like my list could go on. I dont know what I have, except that I have felt like shit for a considerably long time. I really want to feel better but am too scared to be honest with my phycatrist. I have 3 attempted suicides, with 3 hospitalizations, year and years of self harm history, but I have not had any recent self harm or suicide attempts in the past 2 years. I have loads of suicidal thoughts, not just ""i wish I was dead"" but long drawn out thoughts on how I would complete the act, how it would effect everyone around me and what would most likely happen after. Everytime I have these thoughts there is a trigger, usually a fight with a significant other. I end up crying and obviously not doing anything but im really tired of feeling this way. Im on several medications now, and ive been on so many medications throughout the years i cant keep track. I really dont know how I can be honest with anyone about this without the fear of getting locked up in a mental hospital. I definitely get the vibe from my therapist and phycatrist that they would cause this to happen if I was completely honest because of my past. How do I get genuine help without going into the system? Is it even possible? Has anyone else felt this way and had a more positive outcome?

2025-11-07 04:54:25;I feel less lonelier by myself than when I'm talking to people.;"Intro: 

Sorry for any grammar mistakes, my first language isn't english. This is mostly a vent post, but any advice is welcomed. I'm 20F, and have been previously diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at 15 years old, but stopped taking medication at 18.


My social life right now: 

I have few friends, but all of them right now are either long distance or are online friends; I'm completely alone at college (I'm in my third year). It's probably for the best, since they can't physically see how much of a mess. Right now, seem to be on the verge of complete social isolation; I haven't contacted most of my friends yet.

A few months ago, I tried to join an association at my university to indirectly try to make friends, but it mostly consists on voluntary work, virtual activities, or informative conferences. I haven't seen an opening for me, and right now I'm quite inactive. 


Main reasons why I don't tend to open up: 

1) For all my life, I have never felt seen. Not once. The very few instances I have remotely opened up to anyone, they either say (if they even can say anything) ""I understand"" or ""I get that"", but one can tell it's just superficial or they just ""relate"" me. I guess there hasn't been a time where I felt truly heard or understood. ...To be fair, I'm the hypocrite who never *fully* opens up to begin with.

2) When it comes to my divorced parents, ever since childhood, it's like I have been conditioned to avoid being emotionally vulnerable and speaking up about it; it would be often used in court. Now, as an adult, my mother has shown a habit of using my emotional problems/worries against me at a later moment every time I talk to her about it, plus imposes her catholic beliefs onto me. My father... He unfortunately lacks emotional intelligence. Mother and father are good parents on paper, they're just not perfect.

3) I'm afraid of me getting hurt, or hurting anyone in the process. Even worse, they might follow my example; it has happened before. I'm not sure if this is some type of social anxiety... I don't have trouble with talking to people, but these past few years I have been specially hesistant in forming deep, meaningful relationships. It's bad to the point I seem to be sabotaging any arising opportunities.


Why I prefer to overall keep myself company:

Honestly... At this point, I have accepted that I will never meet a person who truly understands me. Being by myself, acknowledging that I'm the person who truly knows myself best, brings me some sort of comfort. It's way better than desperately looking for a miracle. But like I said, I know, I'm the hypocrite who barely opens up to begin with... I'm the problem. Even now screaming at the void of reddit, I'm choosing to keep things for myself. It's a lonely path, but I'm used to it by now.

Of course, this won't mean I'll entirely ditch my friends, that'll be too selfish. I'll most likely just keep things the way they are, and not expect anything deeper than that, yet still remain a good friend to them.


Outro: 

I doubt anyone will read this whole thing, but if you do... Thank you listening to this random stranger, and congrats, have a cookie <3.

2025-11-07 04:06:17;Got into a car accident and now I feel empty and angry;"My car is completely fucked, I got wrecked from behind and it pushed my car forward to the car in front of me. It's damaged on all fronts, it's definitely totaled. 

I keep doing this. Why now. I feel so fucking numb and angry. I want to do nothing, exist as nothing right now. I don't want to be. I can't focus on anything else but how now I have to get a new car and do the while song and dance on my insurance and all of this stuff. I'm so tired. I want this to stop. There's too much issues piling up around me that I feel I can't control. 

As soon as I was officially diagnosed with autism, my depression has been a big question about whether I actually have it or maybe it's just my autism. But tbh I think it doesn't matter. It shouldn't have been this big conundrum in me on whether I'm depressed. If I'm feeling dead inside, it probably is depression. Who knew.

 I feel like I'm a child again. Like I don't know what I'm doing. I thought being older would make things more clear but honestly the most clear thing is how I don't belong here. I don't feel like I'm suppose to be here. I know I'm not. There's this feeling within me that I'm in the wrong place. 

Also the last thing I want to think about is my job even though it's like the only thing I'm ok at. Also I don't understand people and I know the feeling is mutual. I hate being alone in a room full of people. I feel so empty I just want to stop";r/depressed;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1oq9dvz/got_into_a_car_accident_and_now_i_feel_empty_and/

I need someone to tell me what’s wrong with me, so I can finally get some help. I have a family doctor, but she’s not the best with mental health. I’ve even asked her for a referral somewhere, and she said I didn’t need one, and that she could follow me.

2025-11-07 01:47:01;I'm back to where I was 3 years ago;"I used to be very lonely,  anxious, depressed, scared before and was lurking here everytime.
But my situation fortunately got better as I was surrounded by people i knew my family even if the family of mine wasn't that good there was this sense of familiarity, being among those who know you.
As someone who was socially anxious and couldn't make friends, always was isolated everywhere. This helped me a lot cuz I felt not being alone.
Even if I was because of no friends, no meet-ups , hangouts, no interaction outside of my family members even those were from who lived at the house not anywhere else.
So I was good for like 3 years before becoming the way I am now.
Which is because I came outside to study again, 2 years of mine already were wasted but I decided to not look back and focus on the future. Now I'm very far from my hometown, my family people i knew the environment I was familiar with.
It's been 2 weeks and I'm feeling very scared, alone, depressed. Unable to make friends in college because the people and environment I'm in doesn't let me do so.
Cuz no matter what happens I'd rather be alone then be friends with wrong type of people which is what I'm surrounded by completely.
In any case I can't have a proper interaction with anyone.
There is no one to talk to here. I'm alone in this city.
 I atleast have my mother who talks to me through phone but I can't trouble her much or she starts stressing and ruins her health.
I don't know what to do anymore.
How to live. How to be busy.
How to study which I came for.
I am already diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and mood changes.. and eat prescribed medication that helped me aot in last 8 months and kept me in line.
But after coming here even those don't help me , doses I take were already a lot more for someone aged as me (21) but now it feels not working cuz the overwhelming negative thoughts, loneliness, depression, anxiety, stress I'm feeling is too much.
It's miracle I'm not getting headache.
These emotions couldn't be felt by me before coming here because my mind used to be numb and even if these thoughts come it felt like there was a invisible wall blocking them.  I can't feel them even I try.
But now I can little bit to mild.
I was also told by my doctor to not go outside but i dint  listen and wanted to go and I'm now regretting. I wanted to be in a new better environment, better place, make new friends.
I thought i could finally do all that but alas I failed second time.
I'm so sad scared lonely I don't know what to do.

2025-11-06 23:36:33;Venting (Mental health and Relationships);"It's my first time writing something on this platform so I'm a bit nervous. I've been mostly dealing with a recent rejection of someone whom I liked for a while, which made me feel worse off mentally so I cut contact. Shortly after I had a panic attack in the restroom that morning. I was planning on s\*icide but told a friend of mine before I acted out on it. I feel like it was the worse I ever felt in years. I didn't tell my parents because it would obviously worry them, so he felt like the safer option. I also remember telling him that I was fucked up for having feelings for someone and that no one would ever love me in the future. I thought he would hate me if I told him that I liked a mutual friend of ours. I find it weird that I thought that way, but I think it's because I've withheld my feelings for a long time that I was afraid of being judged. Being the kind friend he was, he offered to play games with me over the weekend, and it helped take my mind off of it a little. We ended up texting each other all day, and it was clear that I felt lost. I didn't have any hope of getting better, especially since I've had mental health issues for years.

 It's been about a month since it happened and I've been getting a little better despite struggling to feel motivated, but overall, I feel like a broken record.

 The last time I dated (2021), my ex-girlfriend (of 5 years on and off) was strongly abusive. I felt like she ruined my mental health to where I couldn't leave her out of fear. We were young. I don't want to specify how we met and how old I was at the time, but I dealt with constant bullying from mutual friends of ours. When we got older, my mental health became worse, and it was clear that despite being finished with the relationship she still wanted to be friends and keep tabs on me. I felt like I had no choice because she would block me and come back weeks later to ""turn a new leaf"". Dealing with the constant manipulation for a long time, I obviously had grievances towards her. When I cut contact with her, she called me an ""obsessive freak"" and was yelling at me over text. Then accused me of playing victim and claimed to be the ""true victim"" in the situation. The last text I received from her, she basically said ""I'm sorry I hurt you; you hurt me, I trusted you."" Her friends bullied me into depression so bad that it had a huge effect on me physically and mentally. I felt like crying in bed and my body felt hollow the first couple of days. I was constantly on the verge of tears at school, and I felt like it was my fault.

It's 2025 now and my ex moved on with a boyfriend of 3 years. I think if we were to talk again, she would give the ""we were young"" speech and that I should move on, but nobody moves on easily from years of abuse and toxicity. I moved on from her romantically but If I were given the option to tell the whole world, exposing her and the things she said she did, I would. I think it's why I'm here now, typing this. 

On top of that, I've been diagnosed with Social Anxiety and Depression, but I feel like there's something more to it which I can't put my finger on. Some days I just feel really unstable. Other days I feel fine. Most days I feel in between. People tell me that I should move on and get better, but it doesn't help at all. It just feels like I'm fighting a battle every day to not end my life. ";r/mentalhealth;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oq24dc/venting_mental_health_and_relationships/

I feel lonely, disconnected, distracted and empty. Sometimes, I am manic and unusually excited but sometimes I am also extremely hopeless. Talking about mental health is such a taboo where I live, when you talk about it, you will in turn get traumatized about being weak or just stress. Although stress isn't something small, the taboo diminishes it to be something very minor. I feel extremely ostracized from my pears and I have to masquerade infant of others to get along.

2025-11-06 23:00:58;Medication that still lets me feel?;"So I think I’m struggling with depression. 10 years ago I got diagnosed after my dad died and they put me on Prozac then it was switched to Effexor. I told them I wasn’t depressed (I was numb at the time but it was understandable after what happened) but they insisted. Years went by on it, I got to the point where I didn’t know if it was helping my mood or anything but I knew I couldn’t feel my sad emotions very well; which I wanted. I had dated someone who wandered if I even had emotions because I was so stonewall sometimes and honestly I didn’t know myself. Effexor also made me gain 35 pounds. I didn’t make the move to get off of it until I read that the girl from modern family lost all her weight once she got off of Effexor lol. Once I got off of it (which fucking sucked because the withdrawl was so brutal) and I started sleeping at night due to getting the right treatment for my narcolepsy finally, I lost the weight. Now I’ve been off it for maybe 4 years and I’ve noticed an improvement with my emotions. However the past year, I’ve been depressed again and burned out after a break up and burn out with work and school. I get home from work at 5 and have very little energy to do anything and can’t maintain enjoyment watching tv anymore. I used to love tv but now everything is boring me and I don’t finish shows I start. I crave sleep and escape at 6 pm and the hours from 6-9 feel so freaking long. My mom has told me she noticed that I don’t have the same joy for things anymore and I feel it. I don’t get excited about things anymore…and I feel it. I need some help but I’m also worried because I hated antidepressants in the past. The weight gain, the numbing of my emotions (though I feel pretty numb rn).

So yeah, like the title says. I’m 14. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13, and honestly, life’s been kinda rough since then.

It mostly started with school stuff. I ended up telling my friends about my symptoms because of what happened last semester. Whenever we got group projects, I was always with my friends, but I was the only one actually doing the work. Like, literally everything. I’m not exaggerating.

Whenever I asked them to help, they’d always go, “Uhh, I can’t do this,” or “I don’t know how.” Eventually, I got fed up and decided to confront them. That’s when I told them about my depression. They all seemed understanding at first, or at least I thought they were.

But one of my friends (let’s call them Haru) started acting really off after that. They began looking at me weird, and lately I found out they’ve been venting to their other friends saying stuff like, “I hate people who use their mental health to guilt trip others.”

2025-11-06 19:22:50;The pop psychology culture of social media has damaged my sister even more.;"My teenage sister has almost attempted suicide a couple of days ago. Out of sheer hopelessness and desperation she walked through the streets in the middle of the night hoping to get hit.

My sister has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder years before. Two days after the incident she came to me crying. Saying how much she hates the diagnosis. How much she hates that it is the most hated diagnosis and that therapists run away from it because of how hard and untreatable it is. How much she hates the fact that she will deliberately destroy every relationship she has with her “favorite person” and that she has hurt the person she cared about the most because of how she is. Like it is in her nature to hurt people. 

I knew this wasn’t something she heard from her therapist, I personally was diagnosed with adhd and stopped listening to anything related to it online especially from TikTok and instagram because of how over simplified and full of self diagnosed people. It is dangerous and damaging. But the fact that it filled my sister with things bad enough that would make me almost lose her made me angrier. 

I’ve been reading studies online about my sisters condition. Anything that will help erase the dangerous suggestions she obtained from social media. I’ve learned about how old the stigma is, how helpful therapy is for them and how the “hate” usually comes from the burned out psychiatric nurses. And I would really appreciate it if anyone can share any material that would counter the dark and hopeless crap she internalized from social media. 

It is insane how the notion of “the hardest disorder” to treat is blown out of proportion online, let alone the fact that it is terrible to have while at the same time people are faking ticks on TikTok and presenting ADHD as a fun disorder to have that gives you “powers”

This pop psychology culture has really harmed my sister and I would very much appreciate any help and advice. Thank you greatly.";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opwcib/the_pop_psychology_culture_of_social_media_has/
2025-11-06 19:16:21;Therapist terminated a year ago and I still struggle;"Hello everyone. Ive seen a few posts about therapists terminating, a lot of people were saying that it takes time but it's been a year and I am still thinking out my previous therapist every single day. She was my first therapist and I had a very unhealthy attachment to her. That attachment wasn't entirely my fault as she acted very friendly, blurred boundaries and self disclosed a lot. Most of our sessions were us laughing together and her telling me how much she cared about me. I cried for days straight when she terminated me in the middle of a crisis and recommended a higher level of care. Now, not a day goes by that I don't think about her and it comes with these waves of intense emotion (anger, guilt, sadness).

I genuinely felt like she was helping, I saw her for 11 months. During our last session she diagnosed me with bpd and started listing off things she had been holding back throughout treatment, I had no idea she felt that way. She told me things I had said or did that bothered her. She even brought up a situation i had with a separate provider (she learned from reading my notes) and sided with the provider without asking me what happened. Another reason she gave was that i had “frequent crisis”. She told me i could come back but i later found out that i am permanently banned from her office.

I know that she did the right thing since she felt like she couldn’t help me, it’s just when and how she did it. It seemed like she had no regard for how this would affect me.

I just want to know if it gets better. I still grieve the relationship like it happened yesterday. I’ve wrote her a very emotional letter a few weeks after she terminated- she put it in my permanent medical chart and never responded. I feel like it was all fake. I felt like there was something wrong with me and that therapy couldn’t help me. I couldn’t believe that she would leave me when i needed her the most. I highly doubt it was bc i needed a “higher level of care” because when i first started seeing her i was actively struggling with SI and SH and she was comfortable working with that. I think it’s because I called a crisis line and they reached out to her office. Is that a normal reason to terminate and how can i start feeling better?";r/mentalhealth;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opw8c6/therapist_terminated_a_year_ago_and_i_still/

Since i’ve been in “remission” and off my meds for well over a year I am constantly thinking about death, but not in the sense of wanting to die. Almost every single day I think about death and how much I am actually scared of dying, a lot of people have told me all I have to do is just live in the moment but I want to be able to not think about death at all.

every normal thing people do, it feels strange when i do it as well, all the people ive tried talking to are always visibly uncomfortable no matter how hard i try to appear okay

i couldnt count how many times ive subconsciously made an enemy just for being.. me, people always thought the opposite of what im thinking, when i see things in a positive light they always see it in a negative one and vice versa

im not a serious person, i just dont get how this humor things work, the things people find funny just doesnt apply when i tried doing it too

2025-11-06 14:26:25;Autism ruined my life.;"This is long, and im sorry, but im confident enough in saying my autism diagnosis ruined my life, probably permanently. Autism, as a disability, didnt do everything. Some things yes, but not all. But the diagnosis did. I dont even know if i really am autistic, i think the doctors just said it all for an excuse not to do their job.

Im not looking for help. Im not looking for advice. Im not here to say people shouldnt get a diagnosis, because not every autistic person will have the same experience. And i hope they dont have the same as mine. But it screwed it over for me. Doctors refuse to help me in any way, shape, or form, because i have that dreaded ""autism"" label on my files. I have had multiple therapists over the past year or two, and every single therapist follows the same pathetic script. ""Its just autism"" , ""are you sure it isnt your autistic mind?"" , ""its just how you see the world. Because youre autistic""

I have suffered with hallucinations, delusions, dissociation, insomnia, and headaches all of my life, i would say. At first this concerned the people around me, so i managed to finally get in for therapy after 4 years of waiting, being on the edge of crisis the entire time. The doctors immediately took me in and within the same week i was professionally diagnosed with autism. Thats cool i guess. They hardly did any testing at all with me anyways.

Now whenever i try to express my concerns, whether mental or physical pain, they read my file, kick me out of the doctors office, and say its ""just autism."" Its ""normal in people with autism."" But i dont know how to handle it. I want it all to stop. But nobody is teaching me how to make it stop.
I didnt know chronic hallucinations and migraines were autism. Psychologists, psychiatrists, physical health doctors, online help lines, they all say its autism. So i go to autism communities and nobody understands me, they say thats not what autism is and that im being gaslit. I dont fit in with any group. I never will fit in with any group.

Now im stuck. Denied basic healthcare all because of a stupid autism diagnosis label permanently ingrained into my file, unless i retake the autism test and try my damn best to act as neurotypical as i can to get it removed. I dont want to be autistic. Why do all the other neurodivergent people my age get help. Why am i left to die out in the cold.

I cant report any incidents because this is normalized. And when i try to speak up, im shunned down for being autistic. I feel like a crazy person back in the 60s for not being believed because i was professionally diagnosed as insane, no matter how true my efforts were to express my needs.

2025-11-06 14:17:15;Should I stop meds + therapy;"Hi guys!

I'm very new here but I wanted to ask for some advice on something I've been thinking about for a while.

I've been in the psychiatric healthcaresystem for the past ≈3.5 years. This has lead to a diagnosis and medications. I've also been on the list to get KBT or other kinds of therapy but nothing so far. I've talked with a lot of different professionals.

I feel like my appointments are mostly triggering. Like with my ED they've multiple times asked me if I'm bulimic, and that it's very good I'm not because it would be worse. And it just makes me want to puke. And there's multiple things like that.

Also, I've been on different meds for years now, and none have worked very well. I'm currently on venlafaxine and the nurse suggested to increase it but I've been on a higher dose before and got a lot of side effects. So no can do. And I have multiple others as well. But I don't really think they're working that well.

I also feel so tired all the time, and I'm thinking this might have to do with my meds.

So I've started about whether I should quit. Just take a break from the healthcare system and see how I do on my own. But I'd love some advice from other people that have been in similar situations or have some relevant experience, or just anyone that would like to give advice. I am also going to talk to my counselor about this, so don't worry, I'm not making and rash decisions from the advice on strangers on the internet. But it would be helpful to hear some thoughts on this.";r/depression_help;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1oprft1/should_i_stop_meds_therapy/
2025-11-06 11:56:40;What do I say at my mental health consultation?;"I (teenage f) struggle with multiple 'mental health issues' (nothing diagnosed, just weird things about me), one of these being pretty bad social anxiety. I have a mental health consultation tomorrow about my obsessive tendencies and possible depressive symptoms as well as my general mental health. I know the woman who I'll be meeting with (she prescribes me birth control) but I am still unsure of how to proceed and what to tell her.

For reference, my ""obsessive tendencies"" (as dubbed so by my mother) include:
-Needing to count whilst I walk a kot of the times, every step is on a set of 2 with the right foot leading
-everything must be multiples of 2 or 5, witht eh exception of 13. 13 is good.
-I cannot wear socks or slippers without shoes. The texture is evil and makes me angry.
-When people shout or talk at all when I am trying to work I get incredibly upset and feel that I must kill myself and harm others
-Extreme Misophonia(?) (cannot sit around whilst others eat if I am not eating, asmr is my worst enemy)
-I cannot have a trashcan inside my room (which is honestly kinda messy anyways), in my old room my dad forced me to have one and I had to hide it so I wouldn't go crazy
-I want to destroy my palms. I feel a deep need to scratch and harm my palms, I have a more graphic description of it but I dont believe it is something others want to know about. 
-Thinking about breathing fills me with rage. This has gotten better as I've e gotten older, but still. 
-I dont like cleaning, but once I start to organize something I will not stop and will not let others help. I will organize everything in every way possible for the smallest cleaning project.

For the depressive things:
-Irregular sleep. I have never been able to sleep long or early, but now I spend a long time after waking up just staring at the wall and I have found I take naps more frequently even when I am not tired.
-Doing nothing for long periods of time, staring at walls, sleeping. 
-I want to do things but they feel impossible. Even things like doomscrolling or playing vidoegames feel too hard at times, so I just stare at walls or sleep.
-Bad hygiene keep up. Especially brushing my teeth (they're yellow and I hate them) but showering can be hard too. I know not showering has been a meme recently but for me its real.
-Weird eating habits, I'll go through cycles of eating till I hurt for months and then suddenly starving myself for a similar time period.
-Just not feeling happy anymore. I'd day I've been depressed (if not clinically) for about four years, but my parents are just now noticing.";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opou2l/what_do_i_say_at_my_mental_health_consultation/
2025-11-06 11:12:40;27M, new dad. Guilty for being depressed when life looks good;"27M. I have what I wished for: a loving wife, a 5-month baby girl, and a stable remote job. Five years ago I dreamed of this, studied hard, graduated, even did postgrad...
But deeply inside of my heart I feel hollow. Why? I wish I knew.

Anhedonia, numbness, nothing feels good. My brain won’t shut up, even in the happiest moments I feel this way. I just can't feel any pleasure in my life with the things I've built.

The worst part is guilt.. being depressed while having what many people want makes me wonder I am ungrateful and don't really deserve what I have.

Diagnosed with ADHD in 2023. Did two neuropsychological exams between 2024 and 2025 and was diagnosed twice with bipolar disorder type 2 but I really don't know. Some days I feel ""ok"" but most days it's this fucking feeling of nothingness.

Tried a lot of meds with many psychiatrists: Lithium, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Escitalopram, Bupropion and others i can't even remember.

Now I only take SNRI (venlafaxine). Night benzo dependence, fucking clonazepam addict, take ~20 drops, lately I don’t even count. This drug just makes me feel better because it shuts everything down. But I am feeling the consequences in my memory.

I went from 80 kg (175 lb) to +40 kg (+90 lb) in a year with marriage + newborn. Binge eating, shame, avoiding mirrors, just fucking hating myself.

My life purpose was always the people I loved the most, provide the best for my wife and daughter. It should feel meaningful. Instead it feels like I lost my soul. I lost myself.";r/mentalhealth;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opnxrn/27m_new_dad_guilty_for_being_depressed_when_life/
2025-11-06 10:39:21;I miss being happy so fucking much.;"Seriously, I hate the fact that my life basically turned into shit overnight, and I slowly became depressed as I slowly realized how bad it got.

And in the last few months, I've been thinking about it more and more, and now I think about it practically every day, even if I try to distract myself, it's always on the back of my mind.

And god, that makes me so fucking sad; sad that my life will most likely NEVER be as good as it once was and will only keep going downhill, and there's nothing to make it better since people just won't stop outcasting me no matter how much I try, and my parents don't help much and kinda put part of the blame on me instead of, you know, SUPPORTING ME.

Psychologists were useless and only made me go to a neuropsychologist who is taking forever just to give me a damn diagnosis to see if I have autism or not, and something always happens that delays it. And the hospital doesn't help at all since they're a bunch of incompetents that delay things even more. Oh, and guess what? ALL OF THAT FUCKING BULLSHIT DRIFTED AWAY FROM THE WHOLE POINT OF WHY I WENT TO A PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ISN'T HELPING ON ANYTHING. BECAUSE SERIOUSLY, WILL A DIAGNOSIS MAKE PEOPLE FUCKING PAY ATTENTION TO ME AND STOP OUTCASTING ME? WILL IT BRING MY OLD LIFE? OF COURSE NOT, THIS IS ALL A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME!!!

It's exhausting, genuinely. I can't fucking handle this shit anymore. I just want to be happy again, and the fact that I straight up can't only makes me feel worse.";r/depression;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1opn7j6/i_miss_being_happy_so_fucking_much/
2025-11-06 08:13:46;Can’t handle seeing my grandpa die infront of me;"So I’m a 17 year old girl and my grandpa got diagnosed with cancer when I was about 12. I never realised how serious cancer was because I was pretty young.

He stopped his chemos very early on because if anything it made him feel even worse. So he’s been off the chemo for like 3 years and just been living life without any worries??

So he’s been doing well the past years, he drives, he goes to friends, he does everything really but last month he was on vacation with my grandma and suddenly his health went downhill very fast. Like he’s overly tired, he couldn’t eat and much more. So some of my family members and my mom went over for a week just because he was doing horrible.

Now after all that we’ve come to the realisation that maybe the cancer did get to him obviously. He’s also been losing his voice which means it spread even more, and it could really be the end soon. My family members have noticed many of his symptoms were symptoms people around us had who passed.

About a week ago I saw him in person and it hurt so badly. It was the first time I saw him after his vacation so a month passed and he changed so much. I never knew someone’s health could decline this badly but he’s not the same anymore and hes literally passing infront of my eyes and it hurts me so much physically to see him like this.

I’ve been an emotional wreck the past month but I’m trying to stay strong for my mom because that’s her dad too, but the whole family is walking around eggshells with eachother. 

It’s like we know it’s about to happen soon and we are grieving someone who’s still here but also when I see him I can see, that thats just not him

Today my mom suggested me staying over at my grandparents and I got annoyed and said no (which I feel so horrible for) but j just can’t see my grandpa because I’m the biggest emotional wreck ever.

I haven’t told anyone at school or work about this but sometimes I literally break down suddenly and I also don’t wanna do it infront of my mom because I need to stay strong for her even tho she told me to cry with her if I want too.

My grandpa did tell my aunt that he’s not afraid of dying. Because he know he lived a good life and he’s SO so so loved by all the people who’ve met him, like he had a whole village there for him.

So I need to find peace within myself but a part of me just really can’t accept it and it hurts so so so much ";r/mentalhealth;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opjzir/cant_handle_seeing_my_grandpa_die_infront_of_me/
2025-11-06 08:08:42;I want my Dad back (crosspost);"Hi Reddit! My dad was just recently diagnosed with bipolar and he is in his early 50s. My whole life growing up, he never had any symptoms and/or delusions. I am having trouble understanding the vast spectrum of bipolar symptoms and am looking for clarity.
About 3 years ago, he was falsely accused of SA by my mentally ill stepsister and was out of work for almost two years. The court case was dropped as she admitted to lying, and he went back to work. Ever since all the court stuff, he has not been the same and has been on all sorts of SSRI's and mood stabilizers.
He had 3 manic episodes within a year and he has officially been diagnosed with bipolar. I chalked the episodes down to negative medicine reactions but i'm not so sure anymore. I mean, he's claimed to be Jesus and has wrote it all over the house. His delusions are STRICTLY related to religion and Christianity. (He was NEVER religious before the current wife, he's a ""man of science and physics."") As for the depressive periods, he exhibits trademark symtoms of a low (not showering, no motivation, etc..)
Is this what bipolar can look like? Is bipolar even the right diagnosis? I have so many questions and just want my Dad to be my dad again.";r/mentalhealth;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opjv6o/i_want_my_dad_back_crosspost/

2025-11-06 07:40:45;Would voluntarily admitting myself be helpful??;"I’m 21, recently diagnosed with MDD, GAD, social anxiety disorder. I have been struggling my entire life. I was able to get a one-time rapid stabilization psychiatrist appointment last week which is when I got diagnosed, after having tried several medications with my university doctor and calling the mental health department twice asking for help. The psychiatrist diagnosed me but I can’t get the meds they recommended for another two weeks because I have to see my university doctor to actually prescribe them.

I have an appointment with the provincial mental health department in December. I had access to therapy during the summer, but I don’t have access now until this Dec appt. 

I’m having suicidal thoughts, anxiety attacks, overwhelming anxiety, self-harming, and dealing with really debilitating depressive episodes. Latest one has probably been ongoing for 3-4 months. I have had restrictive habits relating to food in the past and they are returning worse than they have been since 2021. 

I am having intense difficulty with university, leaving the house, household chores, my personal relationships (i don’t date but I have two close friendships), and eating. A heavy stressor for me is that i absolutely can’t handle when other people are upset. My roommate having a bad day will send me into anxiety attacks and it’s really straining my mental health badly. 

I’m feeling helpless. I’m trying to work on ACT therapy but I don’t have access to counselling or therapy. My roommate is urging me to go to the ER to admit myself or get urgent help. I need help and I feel like there is none available. I have almost no support system. 

I don’t know if the ER/self-admittance is the right choice. I am not violent towards others, and I am not in psychosis, so I don’t think they will be equipped to help me. I want to go because I really can’t handle my life right now, but I don’t want to risk it doing more harm than good. Wtf do I do?

im 21(f) and was wondering if anyone else has gone through a short amount of time where it feels like everything has been taken away from you and you just feel like you’ve completely screwed up your life. I want to believe things will get better but man this year has taken a lot from me and my grandma will be gone soon.

if anyone else who has gone through life just tearing them apart and they got out on the other side id love to hear how you got through it bc i truly have no hope right now that things can change. i get scared i’ll attempt again and it’ll be final for me that time.

2025-11-06 06:45:42;I can’t seem to get myself to do anything lately;"I don’t really have a diagnosis or anything like that so I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic but like for the past two years I’ve just been feeling really depressed. I think it mostly stems from my EXTREMELY low self esteem. I don’t like the way my body looks but it’s the type of thing I can’t change by going to the gym or eating more. I’m a girl but I’m about 6 foot and I have broad shoulders and thin hips and scars and all sorts . I just look very out of place and I feel insecure all the time. It’s all bone structure so I’ll forever look like that. But it makes me scared of people looking at me so I don’t go out at all anymore except for school and back which is a non negotiable. Whenever my friends invite me places I always make up lame excuses and stuff. I just don’t like people seeing me in general and I don’t like the way clothes look on me. The fact that I can’t change it makes me feel really hopeless. Since I’m staying at home all the time , I literally just rot in bed and do nothing. I haven’t had any motivation to do ANYTHING at all and even things like eating just seem so tedious. It just feels like I can’t do anything anymore and it’s soooo hard. I’ve felt so disconnected the past 2 years and i don’t know what to do. Nothing interests me or makes me happy anymore like it used too. I think the fact that I have no money also adds to it. My friends plan out things to do and stuff and I just have no money to take part and it also makes me feel trapped and helpless. My grades have also dropped drastically in the past 2 years and I have no talents so I just feel kind of useless. I feel like a combination of these things just make me feel as if I don’t belong. Like I constantly feel as if I shouldn’t be here you know. There’s so much work I should be doing but it’s all too much . I just want to stay in my bed and just sleep all the time. I’m just sooo lazy it’s hopeless.

2025-11-06 06:23:47;Not sure where to go anymore;"Not really sure what im actually looking to achieve with this post I just needed to vent and let my feelings out somewhere. 

I'm 39 and in a really bad place right now and I have been for a long time. 

Back in February I was let go after 4 years due to interoffice politics. My boss and the ceo never really got along and the ceo eventually brought someone in to push him out and finally let him go and since I was the closest to him I was also let go along with about 10-12 others. 

Since then my mental health has been really declining going into full survival mode really shutting out everything in my life including pretty much everything I enjoy doing. 

I am getting interviews but every time I am either too qualified with more than 10 years of experience or not specialized enough of didnt have a specific title. 

I am currently living somewhere all by myself with no family and no friends so I am completely isolated. I am close to my mom but she is in a different state. 

In the past months my mom has also been diagnosed with leukemia  and my mom and my dog is nearly 13 with not much time left. I am probably going to eventually lose my house and I am not sure where I am going to go.

I just feel like a complete failure and lost. I keep finding myself in these situations and am tired of starting over. Back in 2020 I was also furloughed due to covid and it took me a long time to get back on my feet then as well. 

I know that when things go well I can accomplish a lot I got my MBA with a 4.0 GPA. Over the last three years I have lost almost 200 lbs trying to get my health and life in a better place while also buying my house trying to settle some roots and went back to church to find more depth, but none of that seems to matter.

I am pretty much at the end of what I can taken I keep slipping farther and farther away, and I am scared.

- extreme apathy
- feel like I’m just floating through life and my days, down to how I’m experiencing each moment/ each second
- struggle to enjoy things. I’ve been on a two week holiday and have felt nothing
- struggle to experience any feeling of joy beyond love for my dogs
- no feeling of excitement
- irritable, moody, 
- I try to find joy and positivity in things but just find myself critical and irritable
- moody with my partner. Combative.

2025-11-06 04:04:07;Should I get diagnosed? Or is it a bad idea?;"Hello everyone. I'm here to ask your opinions on maybe getting myself diagnosed. I started having mental health problems in 2020 when covid started. At first, it was depression and anxiety, which is mostly gone now. In 2021, I started to experience tactile and auditory hallucinations. I was given antipsychotics and antidepressants, which worked pretty well. I still have some hallucinations, but they are mostly manageable.

For the last 6 months, I found my mental health pretty difficult to live with. I have never been formally diagnosed despite seeing my fair share of psychiatrist. They always said they didn't want to diagnose patients below 18 because a lot can change and they don't want to lock us in a box. Which I understood at the time. But now, I'm older, I've been having these symptoms consistently for years. I'm starting to think it's time I get a real diagnosis. It's a want I've been feeling for quite a while.

I talked a lot with my therapist, and he told me that diagnosis often don't make people feel better, and that I shouldn't label myself. I understand this perspective. 

But I'm just suffering, every day, all the time. I'm either hallucinating or anxious about the next hallucination. Every time I try to focus or relax, my brain goes ""Shit I better not start having hallucinations right now"". It feels like I'm never free.

I followed the doctor's orders. I did the MRIs, the EKGs, the therapy. I took the meds, found the best one for me. When they told me not to look up on my symptoms on the internet because it would just needlessly scare me, I obeyed. I do everything right and I just feel like I'm not taken seriously.

There is something detrimentally wrong with me, and I want to know why. I want a box. It's easier than whatever I'm dealing with. I keep thinking about how easier it would be to just say ""I have this specific issue"" instead of listing off my symptoms. I don't think it'll limit me. I'm open to the idea of changing diagnosis, or even losing it one day. I just want one right now. I want to make sense of what's happening! There must be a reason!

I want to go to communities where people have lived similar experiences. Maybe they have good advice for me. It's an incredibly isolating experience. I post about my hallucinations on the schizophrenia subreddit sometimes, and I feel like a fraud.

I think the bottom of this is that I don't feel like my experience is taken seriously. My parents are very helpful, but I know they hope I'll stop having these problems. I've been thinking about calling my psychiatrist to get an earlier appointment. I'd even be willing to stop my meds or spend a few weeks in the hospital if it helps them give me a diagnosis. I've been to the psychiatric hospital before. Even if she doesn't agree to give me a diagnosis, maybe she'll accept to give me a higher dose. I dont think my current antipsychotics dosage is enough for me anymore.

I know I can't demand a diagnosis. But I just want to make sense. Have a clear view of what's inside me. Have my daily struggles be acknowledged. Have something other than Brain-went-to-shit-disorder.

If you have a diagnosis, can you tell me if it made you feel better? More understood, or less anxious about the future? Do you have any ideas on how I can deal with my current problems without a diagnosis?

Thank you so much for reading. Even when I don't get responses, just posting and knowing someone might have seen my struggles makes me feel a bit better. ";r/mentalhealth;4;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opdjqq/should_i_get_diagnosed_or_is_it_a_bad_idea/
2025-11-06 03:50:11;Problems with Psychiatrist;So I’m going to try to make a long story short. Basically I have been having a lot of issues with my current psychiatrist. I’ve been with this office for a few years now. The guy I had before was amazing but he sadly left the practice. I’ve had a lot of issues with the office itself but my main concern is my new provider. I don’t have a great connection with them but I’m a procrastinator and in the middle of figuring out medication so I’ve stayed. Recently I have been in the works for applying for disability and DMH. That’s how I realized that neither my PTSD or OCD was reflected in my chart despite being my main hitters. I reached out to the office and asked for my chart to be updated and they said they’d reach out to my doctor to get everything up to date. At my next appointment we got all the way to the end of the visit when they asked if I had any questions. I brought up my chart not having all of my diagnoses and how it’s a time sensitive matter since I’m filling out applications. They then told me they could add the PTSD but would need to go over diagnostic criteria for the OCD and that I’d have to make a separate appointment. After a long run around with the office I finally got the evaluation scheduled. What feels weird to me is that this practice has been treating me for OCD for like a year and a half. Including my new psychiatrist. We’ve even been trying medications to manage the OCD. I have since gone back and downloaded all the clinical notes that mention my OCD and ways that it is being managed. Like I might be crazy but it seems weird to me that they have been treating me for OCD even with medication but as soon as I request it reflected in my chart I suddenly need an hour long evaluation. Also this whole time I have telling them that I am diagnosed by two therapist and my current therapist has had me complete the Y-BOCS.  I have asked multiple times if they needed or should have anything from my therapist to move this process along quicker but they never answer my question. They will answer other questions in the same message but ignore that one. I’m also nervous about doing the evaluation with this psychiatrist because I don’t feel like they listen to me. Like they twist my words. In their clinical notes they frequently put statements in quotation when it’s not what I really said. I’m just worried they are going to drag me on a wild goose chase when all I wanted was the OCD they are treating me for be properly documented in my chart. This is just the most recent issue I have had with them. I guess I just want to know I’m not completely crazy and this in fact kinda ass backwards.

I lost my father (I am a Papa’s girl) when I was about to turn 18 and I must say it has greatly affected me. Going through the grief, people seem to notice that I have been handling it well. I am not. I finished shs with honors and my Papa didn’t witness it. I welcomed college enrolled to a program that’s not even my choice but I have to pursue it for the sake of free tuition. I wanted to make my family proud and be the first among my siblings to have a degree. I’ve carried the weight of their unfulfilled dreams as the youngest and life’s pressure of being someone they can be proud of. I did. At some point I manage to graduate with latin honors and immediately offered a part time teaching position in my alma mater. Despite the fvcked up system of the university, I’ve been teaching here for 2 years now. Am I happy? Sometimes yes. Am I sad? From time to time, yes. 

2022 was the year I am clinically diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. I was still in college, juggling between my studies and trying to get better. I’ve been to psychotherapy for a few months but I decided to stop because I don’t want to burden my mom anymore with the therapy and medications. I have to pretend that I am getting better despite the fact that my psychiatrist warned me if I stopped, it will comeback and get worse in two years. I tried to live life the way it is, I hangout with friends, I’ve climbed mountains, I’ve been hiking too which was my Papa’s fave thing to do, I joined two marathons 12km and 5km, I volunteered during the earthquake here in Cebu, I can drink now but I’ve never been drunk, I tried clubbing already, and I was able to express my love to someone without expecting something in return.";r/mentalhealth;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1opcjsx/mental_health_problems/
2025-11-06 02:56:03;What can i ask or say to a psychiatrist for a first ever appointment?;"On monday i'm going to have an appointment with a psychiatrist. I used to see a psychologist a while ago and it never helped me. Like, at all.

So i took the next step, taking an appointment with a psychiatrist. But the thing is i have a lot of problem that i want treated or just want to have a name put on, if that makes sense.

I've been called depressed by my old psychologist and my friend that's studying psychology told me that i show some signs of like a big depression with some big anxiety problems.

And some of my other friends call me autistic but i doubt that's the case, or maybe it is but i don't know and i don't care, i don't want to know about this specifically.

So what kind of questions or what can i say to that psychiatrist to get treated fast, to have a final diagnostic or get whatever meds i can to shut my brain and also so i don't have to take lots of appointment? 

I don't want to make that psychiatrist loose it's time, nor do i want to loose mine.

I just want to get whatever can make me feel happy/good again. Diagnosis, meds, get sent to the psych ward i don't care, i don't care anymore.

2025-11-06 02:49:04;I have a hard time having personal hygiene.;"It is something very embarrassing to tell this for me. I don't know if it could be the result of depression. Yes, I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and have been in treatment for an eating disorder for 2 years. 
I think not wanting to take a bath started with my anxiety and panic attacks in 2021. I had gone 1 week without bathing and that was too much for me, finally my dad dragged me to the shower.
From that moment on, with therapy and so on, I improved in many ways. However, the action of taking a shower remained as something ""optional"", something secondary in my life.

This year 2025 got horribly worse. I feel fatigued all the time. I just want to sleep and eat. My binges increased a lot and bathing is a very hard task for me. Nobody knows, not even my own psychologist or my boyfriend. I feel like I'm not ready to tell anyone who knows me.

I can go 1 week without bathing. Thinking about having to grab clean clothes, a towel, taking off dirty clothes and tidying them up, then getting out of the shower and having to dry and brush my hair... all of that exhausts me just thinking about it, so I avoid it as much as I can. I don't know why this happens to me and it's very embarrassing, especially because there comes a point where I know I'm dirty, and I look like a dirty person. But I can't change it, it costs me too much.
I suffer from hyperhidrosis so imagine, I'm sweating all the time and I also don't bathe 🫠 

What hurts me the most about this whole situation is that I work in the field of fashion: I study image consulting where personal hygiene is one of the most important points of personal image. I love dressing well, in fact, I always leave the house well dressed, with makeup and hair done. But deep down I know that I didn't take a bath and for some reason I get paranoid and feel like people know I didn't take a bath, even though they aren't close to me and can't smell me.

I smoke weed everyday to make everything feel A-Okay when it really really isnt. My life is fricked and I'm probably not going to have a very good future.

I've been abused and neglected by the only two family members that I get to see everyday, my dad chose hard drugs and another woman over his only child, my mom has been in and out of rehab, Ive never had friends or at least real ones in my WHOLE life, the last time I went to school I was bullied by a girl who had me covered in bruises by the time I got home, I have trauma due to men/boys not being able to keep hands to themselves, every relationship I've been in has turned out toxic, my grandpa is trying to kick my grandma out, my moms boyfriend hurt her yesterday and took all of her things and the car, my mom doesn't have a way to work so now we can't get any income which means we're going to stay homeless, and I've struggled with attempts and hurting myself since I was 8 years old. 

My lifeiss terrible and nobody cares. Literally nobody cares about me. I sit in my room all alone everyday talking to people who I know arent even there and giving myself responses. I'm trying so hard to get better. I really am. But life keeps throwing crap at you and ruining everything. Over the years I've become increasingly aggressive and I'm scared I'm going to turn out to be a really bad person. Just like everyone in my family.

I'm not supposed to be smoking actually. I'm too young and I have Left ventricular hypertrophy. It causes me a lot of chest pain and pass outs. Especially when I'm under the influence of pot. I know it's bad but I really can't stop. One day it's going to cause me a heart attack and it's not going to be good. But I don't want to stop because it makes me really sick and I get really depressed and want to attempt again. 

I have Bi-Polar Disorder, ADHD, severe anxiety, severe depression, and paranoia (all diagnosed). People make fun of me for being ""crazy"" and ""ugly"". I know I am but I really don't want to be. I want to be normal just like everyone else. I want to be able to go out in public without freaking out, I want to have fun with friends that I'll never have, and I want someone to love me for who I really am. That'll never happen though. I'm too different too weird. Nobody likes me. They all make fun of me or hurt me. I just want to be normal bro.

Recently in this past year, I have noticed my fatigue and brain fog have skyrocketed. It has made me extremely unproductive and pretty hopeless and depressed. I have like two hours in the day where I feel kinda okay then I crash at like 3 pm. I got a blood test to make sure there wasn't something medically wrong with me, and turns out I am completely fine.

I am not sure if it is lifestyle choices that are making me feel this way. I have developed a caffeine habit and drink 3-5 sugary drinks a day. I also do eat a fair bit of carbs. I do walk regularly but haven't done any high-intensity exercise like going to the gym consistently for a while now. I am just wondering if all those things play a role in why I feel this way?

Cutting caffeine has been so hard because everyone says reduce gradually but I can never stay consistent. I am also worried if I cut it cold turkey, the withdrawals would make me come back to it.

2025-11-06 00:50:10;Misdiagnosed Bipolar;"I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience:
I was diagnosed as Bipolar on my chart by my psychiatrist. He said it’s because I have periods of feeling good in between depressive episodes. Also, my medications have consisted of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anti epileptic meds- just anything to get me to a stable mood.

Note: even my therapist agreed I have Bipolar 2 because I had an episode where I was suicidal and the next day I felt totally fine again, “normal”. It was like flipping a switch. 

In my quest for doing TMS, I’ve seen two other psychiatrists who believe it’s not bipolar because my mood doesn’t get “high enough” to the point of mania or hypomania. The last psychiatrist I saw said my main psychiatrist has been treating me well in regards to medications and that the treatment for unipolar depression and bipolar depression is essentially the same anyway. He did end up approving me for TMS.
And he did confirm that even “unipolar depression” can have these periods of weeks of feeling good before another episode.

I don’t know, I’m reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience, or whose depression manifests in these types of swings? It’s like riding a rollarcoaster sometimes.";r/depression;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1op83mg/misdiagnosed_bipolar/
2025-11-05 23:37:12;Does Bi-Polar ever get better?;"I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 as a teenager. I'm 32 now and my life has just constant turmoil. I have never had a good relationship because it's always so toxic. It's always arguing and yelling and crying. I stopped seeing a therapist and taking meds a little over 3 years ago because I didn't agree with my things my therapist said (she was very religious and tried to bring God into everything), and my doctor took me off of my meds because I wasn't taking them regularly (she said if I wasn't taking them everyday then they weren't even really working and I didn't need them).

I've been hospitalized more times than I can count for mental health issues. I've tried to kill myself in the past, but not in almost 10 years. I believe that's due to my 9 year old son being born. I love him so much but he sees the bullshit. Me being depressed and crying, and arguing with my Bf. 

My life is spiraling again, I'm so in debt and have a good job but everything has gotten so expensive that I'm drowning. My boyfriend is tired of my mental issues and the crying and arguing. My son is now tired of it too. He mentioned moving with his dad. 

At this point, I know I'm the problem. It's me. It's my brain. 

But I was on meds before and I was still all over the place. I'm wondering now if I should try to see a doc again? I can't really afford it and I don't want to ruin myself more financially with medical bills if it won't even help. I don't know if it will ever get better with or without professional help. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to keep hurting everyone. I'm tired of weighing the positives and negatives of actually continuing to breathe and ruin everyones lives. I either want to fix this or just get the fuck out of this life. But I don't know if it can be fixed.

2025-11-05 23:36:34;Overused intellect and this is what happened..;"Since 12years I do not have perfect diagnosis till today, I am confident that what I diagnosed is emotionally okay to confirm.
I used to think that I dissociate repeatedly. I have no good mental clarity for 12 years.
The problem is I’m not intuitively well, I overused intellect in an abnormal way, that costed me hell of 12 years and still counting.
I am 22M. When I was 9,10.. something I couldn’t remember, I was traumatised due to, a principal hit me for not doing wrong aggressively. I am so overwhelmed with fear. I am so sad gone to, too much of depression for many days. I havent spoke about this to my parents and Im mute.
After 3 days past the incident, my intellect become too loud, and I was thinking about an Indian movie “krish”. The movies plot in short is hero’s father is a scientist who discovers a technology which predicts future visually. So I decided to not let my future known to others so Ill be unpredictable.
I started thinking like If someone is going to give me a cup of coffee to drink I am not going to drink it, instead I pour it (Im not gonna do it actually). That was my thought actually I still remember 😭.
I gave room for intellect to think so broad. Watching a movie so someone from behind harm me with knife or something, walking on road so something from the sky might fall.
Perception changed from then, new pattern is developed.
Intuition, instinct locked.
I dont know I am challenging with something, I faced lots of humiliation, too much anxiety, cant make friends, lost reality, emotionally flat, lost in thoughts, no planning, cant feel my body, couldn’t understand what others feel.
It used to feel like society is so elated but not me.
Couldn’t make good in academics, still heart knows that I am worth than what everyone have seen.
But Im completely HELPLESS.
I smoked pot, the intellect 10x got 10^2.
Thats when even my cognitive load couldn’t help. Been into Racing thoughts. I used to think in sleep(thats a rare and horrible experience). Those days I could still remember,no one should ever face that kind of shit.
2 years ago I was casually playing an interesting game suggested by my friend, I am feeling so happy at the moment, after 1hr I was so deeply and immersively involved in that game and I felt like a newly born one. I got a hope that I have life.
I was knowing that I am this intelligent and slowly started crying at some moment.
Even driving a world’s most expensive car wouldn’t buy me that happiness.
The happiness disappeared after a week, due to my past brain patterns I slipped into it again.
I am really smart and I couldn’t able to tolerate looking dumb to relatives and friends, that made me so sad, I slowly realised and accepted.
My chess fide is 1900 >
Actually Im here to get some assurance or get some guidance to get over from it.
I still suffer from this, it is not diagnosed till now, how to balance my intuition and intellect with room full of awareness.

I was curious if any of you have ever been in a relationship or even situationship with someone with a similar mental illness? I have been reflecting on past relationships and have come to realize that the ""connection"" and the lust has been insanely stronger with those who were also mentally ill? I was just curious if anyone else has had the same experience. I often find myself missing those kinds of connections and feelings, but not missing the drama and toxicity of the overall relationship.

2025-11-05 22:22:58;Nothing left;" I am 32 year old male today I want to share my life story here

Life till now :

So I was born in a family where nothing was normal from outside we look happy 
But internally it was all messed up

My father was big time acholic there was only domestic violence and fighting each day 

So from the ages of 1-13 years I used to sleep in my parents room where my father used to beat my mom merecilssy they used to have sex infront of me everyday and it was forced sex to be honest as my mother was scared to reject they used to have sex infront of me they thought I was sleeping but the truth I was not 
And whenever my father used to hug me I feel very scared and uncomfortable and while hugging he used to say many bad words like motherfucker bitch in my ears to my mom 

The result by the age of 8-9 I started masturbating and by the age of 12 I become very hypersexual and wanted to have sex with anybody to release or renact those things 

So I remember when I was 12 years old a elder boy around the age of 18 come to our house he was our servant elder brother so my mom told me to play with him and what a idiot I was as I told you I already was hypersexual I was on his lap rubbing my penis on his chest though it was under my pants then I donot why he showed me his penis and then hide it by saying it is elder thing then later on I was rubbing my penis on his back until I discharge he never told me to stop it 

I also become a abuser myself at the age of 16

From there I started having sex with boys of my age from the ages of 12-18 till then I stopped it as it brings nothing but shame and guilt 

Then I had also sex with women and transwomen as well 

I am struggling with homosexuality/bisexuality porn and masturbation addiction and smoking addiction pied from last 20 years 

I know those events has shaped my sexuality my behaviours till this date and more I live the more I hate myself 

I was never born this way and now I have destroyed my life completely 

I was taking therapy in which I was diagnosed with adhd as well

I failed to be good son failed to be good brother failed to become a good friend 
I failed in all

2025-11-05 22:21:34;When the cure is almost worse than the disease;"This is equal parts venting and question so.

About a year ago I was finally diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety and Complex PTSD (gotta catch em all!)

I've been on Wellbutrin for roughly a year, and added Strattera maybe 8 months ago? We've adjusted the Wellbutrin dose a few months ago. 

However the last little while I've been plagued with headaches and nausea. Migraines are a thing for me, to the degree that I had a CAT scan done 9 years ago that revealed nothing.

And, good lord trying to find any resources about nausea related to meds or migraines when you're a woman is impossible. Everything is just ""Are you pregnant?"" No, after 2 kiddos, I've used IUDs for the last 8ish years.

Anyways, apparently these two things are fairly common side effects but they've gotten wildly aggressive lately, has anyone else had additional side effects pop up months after starting meds? Realistically I could probably align the start of this to when we upped my Wellbutrin dose, so at least there's that. 

It just sucks, I was doing so much better mentally but this is worse. I can't work, can barely function. Thankfully I work from home but its still not something I can do long term.";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1op45uj/when_the_cure_is_almost_worse_than_the_disease/
2025-11-05 21:50:56;I'm just so exhausted;"Hey there, I'm Alex, I'm 18. Sorry for mistakes, English is not my first language.

I've been fighting severe form of depression for a month and a half already. I just feel so tired of it. Sometimes I have zero energy. I try to help myself by doing some volunteer work but when I'm not working my dark thoughts consume me. Also I had to quit college (had to study really hard to get there) because studying became too draining for me. 

Although I'm surrounded by loving family and friends right now, I suffer from a chronic feeling of guilt and loneliness. I know I'm very lucky to have love and support of other people in my life but I guess I've just been feeling this way for 5 years or even more. I've been diagnosed in September and then I started taking Zoloft that caused me terrible side effects this week. I have had very intense nervous tics for 3 days. Going to see my therapist tomorrow. I hope he will prescribe another meds for me.

2025-11-05 21:43:02;How do I figure out what's relevant to specific issues and what isn't;"Hey, so, this is the first time in my life where I've introspected and reflected on my own actions and personality to this extent, and honestly, I don't know where to begin to understand it all, it's all a tangled web in my head which is interconnected somehow- I've been bombarded with a bevy of information in the past couple of months and it's super overwhelming (although like many neurodivergents i knew something was off) and I can't figure out for the life of me what goes where because everything's so scattered and confusing but also insanely validating since a lot of shit about my life is starting to make sense.

So, yeah, bear with me please, this is quite the rant and I fear it's gonna be a bit long.

Okay so, I was recently diagnosed with adhd and am in therapy, due to it having gotten worse over the past couple of years without me realizing. I'm in therapy for the executive dysfunction aspect but, that's not what this is about, so here goes.

I feel like the comorbidities aspect of it is ruining my life. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety which is, for the most part self inflicted ( I have no clue what the fuck that means but it apparently ties back to intense self loathing and my jaded attitude when it comes to life and the universe in general) My psychiatrist recently explained that while my adhd isn't severe, it's been unchecked for so long that I've plummeted into severe depression and anxiety (been randomly having panic attacks out of the blue for the past couple of months) and my relationships are suffering greatly because of it. 

I have a tendency to slowly ice people out over time due to this ingrained fear of eventually disappointing them and I've had it for as long as I can remember. It's genuinely so hard for me to believe that people enjoy my company and want me around, and for years I've been stuck in this self sabotage cycle wherein, I make friends, we get along really well, form genuine connections and for a while everything's amazing. But, eventually the doubt creeps in, and there's a voice in my head constantly whispering that they're only there out of pity or kindness and I'm wasting their time. And then, even though it's the last thing I want, I start withdrawing, I make myself cold, dry, distant and difficult to be around until I'm essentially this self fulfilling prophecy that I race to fulfill. I've been icing out more and more people as of late, and it seems to be because of a mixture of things- A friend of mine died recently, I'm flunking all my exams because my lack of motivation and organization is gonna be my doom, I'm losing so many people I care about even though I want to keep them and I feel powerless in actually doing something about it because, let's be honest I'm a train wreck and my psyche is hanging on by a thread right now.I keep forgetting to eat and sleep. There's literal days of my life I can't remember.

So, my question is, where do I begin to figure out how all of this is related? I'm honestly extremely frustrated with my inability to be helpful towards my self. I feel like an outsider who's watching their own life fall apart from somebody else's perspective. I'd appreciate any advice at this point sorry I'm such a wreck lol English isn't my first language.

Also, incase this is the wrong to post on about this, please direct me to a more suitable one.";r/mentalhealth;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1op37lz/how_do_i_figure_out_whats_relevant_to_specific/

 I've been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety for the last 5yrs. During this time, the NHS have referred me to CBT, which actually made my anxiety even worse, i made another appointment with my GP after that and they just told me to try CBT despite me stating multiple times that it did more harm than good. This experience has genuinely just put me off trying therapy again.

  
Last year i was temporarily prescribed antidepressants, just for a few weeks to see if they would help. They ended up making things significantly worse to the point that i had to take myself off of them after 2 weeks, i think. 

Since starting my 2nd year of uni, things have just gotten even worse. My depression is so bad that I've only attended 6 lectures in the last 4 weeks and my attendance is being flagged. This and the workload is making my anxiety worse, and im falling behind academically. My uni has student services, but all they offer is CBT, and I'd rather not do that due to past experiences 

I've tried to book a GP appointment through PATCHS, but it basically said that i can't and i have to go to A&E instead? This is neither an accident or an emergency, so i fail to see what they could do about it.

if anyone has any advice/suggestions for what i could do, i would really appreciate. it. i would really like to be put on medication, but since the NHS moved to PATCHS, booking an appointment is virtually impossible, so i doubt that's going to happen";r/mentalhealth;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1op2o3x/my_mental_health_is_getting_increaslingly_worse/

The one time I was trying to have a talk with my stepdad he comes sulking out of his room, staring out the back door before he started to cry. He then left. And then did it again, two more times, the third ending with him laying on the floor crying after I told him that he wasn’t welcome to the conversation right now.

2025-11-05 19:42:30;I'm so confused, I don't know where to start.;"I've been clinically diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety & Depression and self-diagnosed with CPTSD. I suffered a brain injury in 2nd grade which left me with a permanent paralysis and weakness on my right side. I lost both parents and a brother in the same accident, and to add insult to injury, I'm a gay man who was raised by an overly religious family and never had a very sheltered childhood. I've tried the therapy route a few times about 25 years ago but they only wanted to push pills and actually contributed to my distrust of the medical industry.  I've never felt that I fit in and at age of 64 find I'm still looking for real friends and ""my tribe"". Guess I'm just tired of being disappointed with my efforts and feeling invisible to both real life and on line. I try to interact on FB groups and even taken a few IRL  classes with the same interests and hobbies but seems my comments and posts go unnoticed and ignored. How do people like me find true friendships, or is it too late to try? I've been thinking that something like a group therapy setting might help but can't seem to locate anything other than on line. I'm so very tired, I just want to stay in my house with my hobbies and avoid the world altogether.

2025-11-05 15:23:20;My family thinks I need inpatient, but I don’t know.;"I’m diagnosed with severe major depression with psychotic features + gen anxiety. Resigned from school for the semester because my health is getting bad. Home now, and my mom thinks I need inpatient, but I’m not sure.

Background: I have the typical symptoms you’d associate with depression. The kicker: I have very bad episodes of impulsivity. It’s difficult to describe, but it looks like this:

Whenever I get very angry, sad, frustrated, or anything adjacent, I feel like I start slipping away into a numb state. I’m numb emotionally, and I detach from my physical surroundings a bit, but it also feels so chaotic in my body and my mind. It feels like my brain is screaming and my body is screaming too. In states like this, I have trouble attaching meaning or consequence to my actions. There is no thinking, just ‘do’.

I envision myself doing quick and impulsive acts of self mutilation. I’ll ‘see’ myself doing something insane, like stabbing myself in the neck, or walking into traffic, or swallowing a bunch of pills. And then I sort of ‘snap’ back into reality, but those visions feel like they really happened kind of? It feels like my brain walks through the notions of doing whatever it is I thought of and that my body just walked through the process and too even though I never moved. don’t self-harm, but I do have this tendency to slam both of my fists into the side of my head repeatedly in states like this from impulse. First I can envision it in my head, and it happens. I haven’t gone through with any of that stuff just mentioned, beyond the head slamming or punching, because of self control: but the thoughts of doing it are so real, and it’s not like a vision overlapping into my reality, but a physical sensation and active thoughts. 

I also start stimming. I think it’s called that? I rub my neck a lot, and I speak really slowly and agitatedly, and I move my head a lot. I self soothe by talking out loud to myself. Not necessarily soothing words, but I work out my thoughts aloud and converse with myself. When I’m like this from frustration or anger, I also laugh a lot. It’s out of place. But it feels like my mind is literally tearing itself into two from the sheer amount of ‘energy’ in it and my body. Like I need to do something drastic to let it out, like hurting myself in a violent way.

I think I’m a very self-aware person and I wish that I felt like I had any control over this, but I don’t. When the numbness stems from negative interactions with someone else, some of these visions involve hurting them, though I have enough self control to never do that. 

Why I don’t think I need it: I thought inpatient was for people in crisis that need 24/7 supervision. I’m always feeling depressed, and maybe passively suicidal, but the only danger to my life is when I get in these states. I would definitely say I’m in crisis when they happen, but since these states are triggered, would I benefit from inpatient? I just booked an appointment with a new therapist down here and I’m worrying that our one hour session just isn’t going to be enough to cover what I’m dealing with and get a solid plan moving forward. 

I think I’m getting worse because I feel my brain thinking in ways it never has before, paranoid and spiteful ways, but I’m not always in crisis or in need of supervision. Just sometimes. But I feel like I need more frequent care.

What kind of people benefit from or need inpatient, and would my situation benefit?";r/mentalhealth;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oowhp5/my_family_thinks_i_need_inpatient_but_i_dont_know/

My mental health has been insanely bad recently, Im not going to get into the details but Im in a very bad situation. My emotions have always been extremely unstable but they've gotten so hard to deal with at this point where I have to leave almost all of my class period to hurt myself without people seeing (mostly bruising, hitting, kicking etc) my mom has bipolar (she thinks she might have bpd too since it runs it her family but she refuses to get help or a diagnosis so idk) and she essentially puts me on a pedestal 24/7, neither of us nessarily have other family or many friends, I've made sure to detach myself from her but she doesn't seem like shes capable of doing the same. She refuses to let me go to a therapist or get medicated. I can't handle life. Im not allowed to talk to anyone about what happened to me(school counselors etc, because they're mandated reporters or whatever.) and my mom just blocks all of it out. Im currently in high-school and can't get a job nor move out, me and my mom live semi rural as well so finding work would be almost impossible for me.

2025-11-05 12:47:43;I don’t think I’m Hypersexual but I definitely am something;"This is my first post on this sub so forgive me if it’s poorly written. 

I’m 19f and ever since I was 14? 15ish I’ve been touching myself and each year it seems to get more and more frequent. I’ve never had a boyfriend and I got my period around 14 so I’ve never really experienced true horniness, so I’m not sure if I’m even valid to say in hypersexual? I’m not even sure if it’s the right word for how I feel. 

I touch myself mainly because it eases my anxiety. I’ve been diagnosed since I was in the 3rd grade but I’ve never sought treatment for it as i am from a Hispanic household where mental health doesn’t exist 💔
I feel gross thinking about it and gross after I’m done, but in the moment it feels so good that the guilt can be masked in pleasure. It gets so bad to the point where sometimes I think of calling up random guys to go over to their house so I can just feel something, even if I’m a virgin and I know it’s not ideal to have sex just to have it and I should probably wait until I meet someone I love. 

From what I’ve read, hypersexuality stems from pornography exposure in early childhood or SA - neither of which I’ve been exposed to or experienced. 

The earliest recollection I have of porn is when I was in maybe 1st or 2nd grade where I’d watch stupid YouTube shipping videos (like Elsa x Spider-Man, or Sandy x SpongeBob) where the person would either animate porn/intimate scenes or reenact scenes with dolls. 
The only other experience is when I would sleep with my parents (I was a very anxious sleeper so I slept with my parents till about 7th grade) and when cuddling my mom she’d slide her hands under my pants and underwear to rest where the waistband of my underwear would reach. She’d never touch me, but she just said how her hands were always cold and she needed warmth. This was normal, because her hands are cold and she’s even sometimes just rested her hands on my stomach. Whenever she’d do this I’d rub my thighs together because her cold hands would make me so uncomfortably cold. She told me that her mom did this to her too and that it was normal. Now as a 19 year old I look back and question it, but nothing weird ever came from it so I don’t feel anything towards it. 

Now whenever I have cold hands, I shove my fingers between my legs for warmth, usually not even in a sexual way. Whenever I get back from school (I’m in uni now) I usually touch myself until my anxiety from the day would go away. I don’t think I’ve ever finished from it, but it’s enough to where my legs shake, my breath becomes uneven, and I’m left feeling achey. 

I know this is a lot to read and probably all over the place, but if anyone has any insight on what they think this is that would be helpful. Maybe this is just normal, but I’ve talked to some friends (not about all of the details, just about self pleasure) and a lot of them say they don’t do it, don’t feel the need/want to, or tried and didn’t like it and just never continued. 
I’m not gonna go to therapy over this or probably ever mention these things out loud, but for the sake of my own sanity I’d like some advice and input from unbiased povs. Thank you for reading if you’ve read up to here lol ";r/mentalhealth;2;20;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ootuet/i_dont_think_im_hypersexual_but_i_definitely_am/
2025-11-05 11:41:36;I wanna die;"To be clear: I don't plan on committing suicide. Not yet.

I'm usually a straight A student. I had plans and stuff. Now i have a D and 2 Cs. I know I have ADHD, but this stupid diagnosis is raking forever. I haven't even been asked about it yet, only my teachers have. Not that it matters. My mom won't let me be medicated anyway (and then she'll get mad that I have bad grades)

I should also say that one little grade isn't what makes me wanna die. It's just that I'm scared for my future.

Bad grades means lower chance of a good college. 
Bad grades also means a bunch of talks with my parents and school counselors, I assume. 

I haven't done SH in a long time, but I wana start again.

I'm also scared because I have no friends (I have severe social anxiety) and I think I grow up all alone.

Also, my life is extremely repetitive. Evey single say is the same, boring thing (no, I can't change this).

I can't even be myself at home. I'm a femboy, but I can't dress up as or act like one since my family would disapprove.

All I want, more than anything, is to have at least one real-life friend, but I know that can't happen. 

I hope I die in my sleep tonight. I'm at least a tiny bit hopeful, which is why I'm not currently taking all the medicine in my house. 

I wish I could just skip to the future; one where I own a house, have a ton of money that I can give to charities and use to make animal sanctuaries, live with a pet bunny, and have a really close friend. That's  all I really want. I don't even need the money part. Just a small house, pet bunny, and close friend. 

Maybe I could also do acting or singing. 


But I can't have any of that. I'm an adult yet, and it's not like every adult is given a house, pet bunny, acting career, and a few friends, so I can't even have what I want. I probably never will.

I'm 15, so I guess I'll just wait a few years to see. 
Contrary to the title, I don't really wanna die, I just wanna skip ahead. 

I hope I do make it through these three years. At least then I'll have a lot more freedom. No school, more importantly. Although I guess I'll probably go to college. So maybe more like 6 years. That's a long time, though, so maybe I'll just kill myself instead.

2025-11-05 11:38:27;No contact with a trauma bond/favourite person?;"I am at a loss for what to do and I really need some advice or support for what I’m going through. I have been diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) as of early 2024.

I dated this guy a few years ago, he was emotionally unavailable and showed a lot of toxic love bombing traits so I ended things.

That didn’t last long. In that short time period he became my FP (favourite person). Ever since we have been in on and off contact: more like friends but definitely didn’t stay platonic. He got back with his ex shortly after we ended things but we stayed in each others lives. I don’t feel right about that but I seriously couldn’t let him go.

I think the reason I got so attached was because he was going through a lot of issues with his gender and his mental health. He called me the only person that he could freely talk to and understood him.

Fast forward to now, I’ve been in a year long relationship and I cut contact with him at the beginning out of respect for my partner.

For the most part I am totally fine without him, however I have lots of lonely nights where I long to reach out. I have a few times during episodes and immediately deleted the message. I am being TORTURED by my obsession with the thought of him. And I truly believe it is the thought of him because I honestly didn’t find him or his personality that attractive. I loved the way he desired me and always begged for me to stay in his life.

I also get this really odd feeling that I’ve realized isn’t normal. I get these waves of “what if he’s watching me right now?” I feel like I’m performing for a camera that isn’t there just in case he sees me. This feeling happens quite often.

Please tell me what your thoughts are? I’m losing my mind, I don’t know why this person has such a hold on my self-worth and emotions. I feel crazy and I’m in between therapists right now.

2025-11-05 11:37:28;I have memory loss and I am so scared, does it get better?;"So, I was recently diagnosed with depression and I think it's been a long time coming. I'd been having a lot of depression-like symptoms for a year but they weren't ""severe"" enough for me to act on it or I would just blame it on my ADHD and keep going as normal until I literally couldn't anymore.

I have been experiencing memory loss. Over the course of this year, despite continued involvement in a work environment where these things are being constantly reinforced, I have slowly forgotten a lot of basic, 101-type content related to my degree field, which is directly related to my job. I have trouble recalling a lot of distinct moments of my past life. I'm less articulate both verbally and in writing, I forget vocabulary I ought to know, and my response time to everything is horrible.

In fact, I've noticed that by the end of the year-long period since I started noticing depressive symptoms (so, a month or two before now), I'd started to lose the ability to form new memories. I'll be having a conversation with someone and, despite perfect attention and comprehension while someone is saying something, when the sentence is finished I have nothing to say in response because I've completely forgotten everything they just said and sometimes even the topic of the conversation in general. I've started keeping a written log describing what I did and thought every day because if I don't, by the next morning I won't be sure. I've become time-blind and struggle with time management in a way I never have before. I'm slow to act, I feel mentally unresponsive and less 'bright' than I remember being, and the world around me feels like it's being filtered through water and all my thoughts keep drifting away from me as soon as I have them.

All I feel now is entombed in this deceptively warm and inviting cocoon of mental oblivion, like the fuzziness is cozy somehow because when I give in to the depression I quickly forget what I was even worried about in the first place and simply exist without thought.

I've read about how long-term depression can change the brain and even shrink parts of it, and I'm worried that what I'm experiencing is a cognitive decline associated with depression. I used to feel so brilliant and perform so well in my life that I'd built my whole identity around being smart and good at what I do, and now it's like I don't recognize myself. What if it's irreversible? What if I'm just going to stay this level of stupid forever?

2025-11-05 09:53:12;My grandma was straight up fucking insane;"
Alright so my mom told me some shit that’s honestly terrifying and wild. My grandma was psychotic as a kid, like, she would literally poop in the toilet, fish it out, and eat it. Her parents had no clue what to do.

Fast forward: she meets my Pop Pop, they get married, and she gets pregnant with my mom. And guess what? She kept eating her own sht and drinking her own pss every single day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She even stored it in the fridge. A bowl of sht and a glass of pss, every fucking day.

Apparently, my mom had a tendency to do it too when she was little, but my Pop Pop put a stop to it. He took her to a doctor, and she was diagnosed with coprophagia, which is basically when someone eats feces.

Eventually, my Pop Pop divorced my grandma and got custody of my mom. My grandma ended up dying about a year later from the effects of living like that.

Honestly, it’s fucking insane to me how untreated mental illness can get this bad, and how it completely wrecks families. Growing up knowing this stuff really shapes how you see the world.

2025-11-05 09:45:26;Does my ex have borderline personality disorder?;"Hey all. I was married to a woman for 10 years. We got divorced earlier this year. To sum up some her behavior: Dozens of times she would get upset over the most trivial matters, insult me and react aggressively, ask for a divorce, then within hours or the next day she would apologize and plead with me in tears not to leave or abandon her. She struggled badly to make friendships and social relations, and that would eat at her. 

She would regularly have bouts of depression (sometimes without an external trigger) and would tell me that she feels completely empty on the inside. She also used to say that she wished she never existed or that she would just die and no one would remember her, and she had a lot of moments when she felt that she had no self-worth. There were other moments when she would get into fits of rage with me or her siblings for very trivial matters. She sees things in a very black-white spectrum and is emotionally very immature and cannot cope or manage her emotions properly. She constantly had problems at work over real or perceived annoyances from her co-workers (across many jobs), and she would often complain about it all day for days on end until she would either take it out on me or the person at work. 

With me, she could be the most tender, loving, caring, and funny person in the world, but when the dark clouds sets in, she becomes complete pandemonium. She could be very judgemental and make me feel like i'm not living up to her standards, or she could make make me feel like the best man in the world. Living with her felt like constantly walking on egg shells, but I still felt very emotionally attached to her. Finally, she decided to get a divorce and carried on with it and made it very acrimonious for no good reason.

Trying to rationalize what the hell i've been through, I started reading on personality disorders. I found that she had many symptoms related to borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although she used to see a psychiatrist (who merely diagnosed her with depression) and took medication, she completely refused to see a therapist/psychologist when I would plead with her to do so. So judging from the above, is it plausible that she had BPD, or is it some other condition?";r/mentalhealth;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ooq2y5/does_my_ex_have_borderline_personality_disorder/

2025-11-05 09:05:43;Is depression supposed to be presenting like this?;"Is my depression my fault? At least partially? This is going to be long, sorry. To start off, I'm currently 15 and I was diagnosed in 6th grade. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'm just confused. When I was diagnosed the therapist had me fill out a form for  anxiety and depression (I think it might've specifically been for children's bit I don't specifically remember). 

I will mention that 5th grade was the worst (I was su.c.d.l and backed out of an attempt once). 

I've always been bad at general hygiene for some reason, the only reason I do it now is that I realized it gives my schoolmates something to say in a fight.

This will sound very strange, but during remote learning I was extremely lonely (Me and my twin brother fight if we have to talk to each other.) I started talking to myself in my head sometimes, and I gave it a name. 
In 5th grade, during a car ride I thought ""What if I was mean in my thoughts"" (Please don't ask me why, the only thing I can think of is that a new girl was causing a lot of drama in 5th grade.)

After that car ride the voice in my head (My subconscious I assume?) would do it itself. At some point in 6th grade it stopped, but because of this I was extremely depressed. 

In 6th grade (Before I changed schools). I have a low frustration tolerance (I've had it all my life). And also bad impulse control (I've had that since I was born early- my parents were warned before they left the hospital. It's because I was born 7 months early). Because of this, sometimes I leave class and hide somewhere small-ish. Typically a bathroom or under the stairs. When I was in elementary school I'd do it under a desk. After I do this I'm sort of just closing my eyes/staring  at a wall or floor. I typically don't remember much of what happened while I freak out and leave.

Because of this I was switched to a smaller school. By the end of that year, I had improved (Asking permission before leaving most of the time). I think because I knew my classmates? Anyways, next year I improved more. The next year, at the end of the year there were two new students who would constantly fight. Coincidentally my progress went back a lot.

At some point in 5-6 grade I started feeling numb. It stopped because my phone turned off automatically (Parental controls) and I felt this weird deep sadness return. At the time I was thankful but eventually I wanted to stop feeling again. A few days before the year ended, a girl spread a rumor that I asked this guy out on a date. I don't know why that  made me numb again.

Before I further explain, this weird disconnect had been happening in short bursts for a few months at this point.
Only this time, I felt a bit disconnected? Like I was looking out of my body from the back of my mind, if that makes sense. I still feel that way now.

This year, it was like I had made no progress over 2½ years. 
But focusing on recently (Nothing really happened until a month-ish ago).
I punched a girl and told her I wished she was dead. (I had been standing in a room, looking at the floor. She was startled and said something mentioning demon. I majorly overreacted, I know.) It wasn't a hard punch because 1. I'm 4'9 and thin/don't exercise
2. I moment before I punched her I thought ""Oh SHIT no"" and tried to stop.


Afterwards I went outside and sat on the stairs. When my mom got there I knew she would yell at me, so I tried to resist getting in the car by Walking away (Continued in a comment)";r/mentalhealth;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oop7oq/is_depression_supposed_to_be_presenting_like_this/
2025-11-05 08:37:50;What the Suicide Spectre means to me;"I was diagnosed with depression way back in second grade, and the mental condition has always liked playing merry hell on my life alongside the more difficult symptoms of my ADHD (the latter of which went undiagnosed until I was in my mid-twenties). No matter what I do, who I have in my life, or how hard I try, it is so incredibly hard to maintain consistent contentment in my life, let alone stability or happiness.  Even in elementary school, I recall having an occasional attraction to the oblivion that suicide offered.

Something altered my relationship with suicide in the about two years ago, in the summer of that year.  There was a guy that grew up in the same neighborhood as me, and was my best friend for many years as a child. I hadn't spoken to him for a very long time, because his growing mental struggles had made him very, VERY, flakey about actually responding to any messages or meeting up when we made plans, and while I had empathy for all of that (I'm also not the most reliable about such things sometimes), I had my own self-care to think about, and when I was having difficulty feeling like I mattered to people, it hurt to put myself out there to re-kindle an old friendship, and seemingly be ignored when I tried to bridge that distance. Well, that summer I was contacted by one of our other former friends from the neighborhood and told that my former bestie had committed suicide. I was stunned. It felt so unreal that he was just...gone. I went to the wake that his parents held at their home. I tried to speak in front of the people that gathered for it, but after a few sentences I choked up with sobs. I hadn't seen him in years, and barely given him much thought in that time, but suddenly I couldn't stop thinking about our childhood together, and wondering if maybe, just maybe, if I'd tried harder to repair the frayed friendship, I might have been able to help him feel less alone and less desperate for release. I saw the pain of his loved ones, some people that came to attend only knew him as an acquaintance from a local bar, or had only met him within the last month. All of us felt that loss so painfully, and to be honest that pain still comes up in vivid detail whenever I stop to think on him again, even as I write this post. I'm not angry about him taking his life, I'm sad. It was such a tragic shame, he deserved to live a longer and happier life, and I wish I could have done more to help him through whatever pain he was feeling.

Ever since then, my thoughts toward suicide have been different. There are still times I long for the nothingness it promises, and an escape from anxiety, self-loathing, insecurity, and the loneliness I deal with nearly every single day, but, having been someone who was, now, only a distant to someone that comitted suicide, I now know firsthand what it does to the people that care about them even a little bit.  It hurts, so bad, and I do have a small number of people in my life that I know it would destroy. My parents, in particular, who have been, and continue to be, absolutely fantastic people in my life (and I often think they deserve a better son than I ever manage to be) would never recover from losing me. So, for their sake, I tell those suicidal thoughts to sit in a corner and leave me alone.  They never fully listen, but it does make them a little more quite for a while.

All that being said, I am afraid of a day, maybe ten or twenty years from now, when my increasingly problematic pattern of self-isolation/social withdrawal causes me to grow apart from the few close friendships I have left to me, and my parents pass away from old age....When I'm no longer living for the sake of those that I know need me, I'm afraid of what I'll do at that point. It's like there's a ticking clock above my head as I notice my parents growing older and older, and I know that if I don't find a way to make new connections and fulfilment in my life by then, I won't be nearly as resilient against those desires to end it all when the time limit on my parents' lifespan runs out. I'll have no immediate family left, and at the rate I am going, no close friendships either. Part of me kind of looks longingly toward that moment of freedom from connection to anyone, but I know that part of me isn't going to lead me anywhere healthy, so I resist those thoughts as well. Hope isn't entirely extinguished, and I still hold onto the desire to make my life into something that I can be at peace with. As the fragile and hopeful words to the last verse of ""This world is a wasteland"" puts it: 

I'm not ready to face it
Don't go saying goodbye
There's a beauty in changes
And I want to try.

Yes your functional to everyone on the outside, but really your a jenga stack two moves about to fall.

I am terrified about expressing what i am feeling to my parents as i worry it may set us back so far. They are finally happy enough to leave me alone in the house.

2025-11-05 04:53:56;How can someone have a depression without noticing it?;"Since a few years, I always feel exhausted. I've been to doctors of several fields, but they haven't found anything which could properly explain it.

A psychiatrist tried on me a bunch of antidepressants none of which really helped. Only atomoxetine pushed me quite a bit, but, at the same time, made me very tense, and strained me so much that, after a few months, I didn't cope any longer and stopped taking it.

I've been in psychotherapy for almost a year now, first a few weeks at a clinic, then one hour per week, but it doesn't seem to help at all, rather make it a bit worse. Diagnosis: major depressive disorder, currently severe episode. The doctors relate it to low self-esteem, causing me to strive permanently for affirmation, and to define myself through performance. Presumably, this was caused in childhood and intensified by an extremely stressful job I've had. But the exhaustion began 2-3 years after I quit that job, and became much worse another year later, after vaccination against SARS-Cov-2.

I've had a few depressive moments in my life, but it's not like that now. It feels like physical exhaustion, like during a severe cold or the flu, but without cough or fever.

What are the odds that I've got used to my (supposed) depression so much that it has become baseline for me, i.e. ""normal"", and that I perceive it only as physical exhaustion?

2025-11-05 00:27:01;Feelings;"Today, like every other day, I feel like an empty shell of whom I once was. I look the same, sound the same, smell the same, act the same, talk the same, laugh the same. But my mind is not. I feel so sad. I don't even know if sad is the right word. It feels like it doesn't encapsulate all of what I feel. I don't know. I don't really feel either. I just am. Empty. Not me. 

I see old pictures of me smiling. I wondered what the feeling of happiness is, wondering if I will feel like that again. Lately I am stuck in this forever emptiness of nothingness. 

I cant even cry. Or that's I lie. I cry while I type this. But it is the first time in months, which is rare for me as I cry of everything and nothing. I think this helps. Whatever this is.

I get space from my love. He supports me. Gives me time. Never expresses disappointment. But I cant help myself to feel like he is, even though everything he does shows me something else. I think I don't understand how someone could not be disappointed. I have no reason to feel like this. My life is ""perfect"". I have a loving boyfriend, supporting my all the time. I bought my first apartment. I have no money problems. I study something I love. I have three amazing babies (cats<3), I have friends, which I see more often then before. I have a loving family I speak to weekly. I am happy, or I should be. I have no ""real"" reason. Despite this fact, the lack of my emotions is all I am. I don't know myself anymore. I don't feel the same. I miss me. But I don't know how to get back. I don't ever think I will. I'm just so sad. The worst thing is that I don't want to go back. I want to feel the misery. At least I feel something. I want this pain. I think I deserve it. Why you say? I don't know, but my mind is insistent. 

Most days I don't want to wake up. But I never want to sleep either. I like the pain I inflict upon myself by being stuck in this state. Day in and day out I sit in front of my computer screen. I should study, but I never do. Hours passing by while I just stare at the screen. I spend time with my friends. I laugh. I pretend. I am fine. Just don't ask too many questions. 

I feel a tightness in my chest each time I try to open up. The words stops coming out. Except for my boyfriend no one know my struggles. And I don't want them to know either. I don't want their pity or their comforting words. I don't to die, but I don't want to live either. 

I don't actually have a depression diagnosis, so I don't know why I am writing this here. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I am not. 

I stopped crying now, and I don't think I will until it becomes too much again. Until then I will keep pretending. Everything is fine. I promise. I am just tired.

2025-11-04 22:34:12;in an emotional rut and don’t know how to get out;"very long vent post, i just needed to put this somewhere. 
hi, i’m an 18 year old female graduating high school this year. 

I was diagnosed with depression this year and more recently adhd and I can’t tell if having the diagnoses has made my condition worse. For the past few years my love for everything has been diminishing so much because i think due to my poor self esteem i can’t muster the energy to love anything extrinsic, let alone myself. i go through periods of doing well to the outside eye and doing visibly horribly to anyone who takes a look in my room it’s been messy for months and i can’t do a fucking thing about it. there’s so much pressure on final exams that i’m just breaking under the pressure and i avoid that by doing things that make me feel good, but even those things don’t bring me any joy now, i feel like a total husk. 

The absolute worst part of this is my relationships are affected so much by this and I don’t know how to stop it. my mom’s always disappointed in me and yelling at me about everything I can’t bring myself to do, even though she knows about my mental state. it feels like she’s forcing herself to keep loving me because I’ve been such a horrible and ungrateful daughter especially considering she’s a single mother, I’ve been such a let down, every day she has to lower her expectations of me and i still can’t reach them. My boyfriend recently chastised me for not caring about my appearance or hygiene or my messy room which i know also came from a place of love but felt so soul crushing to hear, i thought I’d found one person who could see past my many flaws and somehow love me for me but I was stupid to think so. As long as I’m acting like this, i can’t seperate the depression from who I am and I was foolish to think that someone else could do that. I’m fucking things up with him because my diminished ability to love things that I truly enjoy has spread to my human relationships, and I’m unintentionally neglecting him in the relationship and he’s understandably hurt about it and I don’t know how to fix it. I’m honestly considering breaking up with him to spare him from the wreck that I am because he seems determined to stay with me but I can’t fathom why because all I’m doing is neglecting him of the loving relationship that he deserves. I want so much to be that perfect girlfriend that can meet at least some of his needs but I’m so useless i can’t even do that. I really love him and he thinks i don’t because I can’t fulfil the proper duties of a girlfriend as I am right now and I’ve tried to explain how my condition’s been affecting it but ultimately it’s me. I can’t escape the accountability that it’s my fault and i feel like the kindest thing i could do in my state is end it but perhaps selfishly i really don’t want to

more recently and more seriously i’ve been struggling with thoughts of self harm, I don’t think i would ever go through it but the temptation is always there and it’s so hard to not think about it when I know it would make me feel better. it feels like a chance to feel something again in this wave of numbness i’m drowning in which sounds so cringey typing it out but i don’t know how else to describe it. i feel like a narcissist and like a terrible human for not being able to meet the needs of the people around me and constantly wallowing in my feelings instead of focusing on mustering the energy to fix my problems, but I don’t know how I can find this energy that i don’t have to fix every way I am failing as a person. My life is truly worth nothing if i can’t be use to the people around me, and right now im actively making everyone’s lives worse by falling into this emotional rut. 

I don’t know if this is a vent post or a cry for help but i just really needed to write this out. thank you if you’ve read through this whole sob story, i’m sorry it was so long. ";r/depression;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oo8qc5/in_an_emotional_rut_and_dont_know_how_to_get_out/

I feel alone sometimes when I’m awake and everyone’s asleep I feel sane I feel like my heads screwed on. But everyone around me makes me feel like i’m crazy.I have had counselling in and out of school 4 times in total and honestly it’s worked for some things but I’m not sure what to do to feel better. Now I can buy drinks I’m just drinking so I feel alright but sometimes I just want to die I see no point in living . I just wanted to say something even if it’s to strangers because the people around me will just ignore it but it weighs on me so much that it hurts to breathe. Sometimes I go mute and I can’t talk at all and sometimes I want to cry and hurt everyone. I know it’s not right but why has everyone hurt me.I had a counsellor who helped me come to terms with my SA trauma but my skin still crawls when I remember the trust i’ve put and had in people in hopes that they won’t hurt me. Sorry if it’s too much I tried not to talk about my suicidal thoughts too much but I just want people to listen to me and know that I don’t want to hurt anyone not even myself but I feel so numb and empty it feels like the only way to feel something I need to get out of here it’s draining me but I don’t know what to do

I'm a little fat and while I'm not horrifically ugly, I'm also not particularly good looking. I'm somewhat insecure about being overweight and boring looking, but what really kills me is ME. MY PERSONALITY SUCKS MAJOR ASS. I am incredibly nihilistic and negative. I'm a callous asshole. I only try to help people so that I can feel good about myself. I'm impulsive and have poor empathy. I suspect that I'm at least somewhat psychopathic, although I've become more normal over time. But with becoming more normal and slowly gaining more self-control and empathy I feel more guilt, more shame, and self-hatred. Some of the mistakes I have made haunt me 24/7 if I'm not actively distracting myself with bullshit like YouTube, weird pornography, and videogames. I have been officially diagnosed with ""OCPD"" but IIRC the neuropsychologist that diagnosed me said that what I really have is ""Pure O"" OCD. It feels completely inescapable especially because I have PROOF that I'm a BAD PERSON. BAD PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE FRIENDS. BAD PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE LOVE. I'm stuck with myself. I feel like no matter how much I improve I CAN'T forgive myself. I'm taking community college classes and working towards a certificate so that I can hopefully have a fighting chance at starting a career in the trades, but I can't really talk to any of my classmates. I just feel so fake and a sense of ""If only they knew how fucked up I really am, they wouldn't even think of talking to me."" I just feel like a wolf in sheep's clothing. I keep people at arms length and just do the bare minimum of socialization, in order to not be perceived as completely rude. I wish people would stop trying to talk to me. Especially girls. There's this one chick that is definitely at least somewhat into me for whatever reason. It always boggles my mind when a girl is attracted to me. It confuses me and gets my hopes up before my self-hatred quickly comes into play and crushes my dreams. I just know that there are two inevitable outcomes if I become close with people: 1. They reject me 2. They accept me, and then I inevitably hurt them, because it's in my nature to make other people's lives worse without even trying. I just feel like a black hole of a person, get too close and you'll get pulled in. I feel like I have a moral obligation to keep people at bay. It sucks ass because I feel extremely lonely and I want to connect with people but I just CAN'T. I feel like the only real solution is suicide, but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it. I almost did many years ago but chickened out (trains are scary as fuck, I couldn't override my fear response). If I owned a gun though I most likely would have done it already though. I just see no light at the end of the tunnel. There are two OCD treatment places near me but I'm pretty sure both of them are tentatively covered by insurance. Like, the sessions / treatments themselves aren't covered but you can ask for reimbursements from your insurance provider or something. I'm too lazy to even check the specifics on that. A big part of it is social anxiety and hating talking with people on the phone (I'd have to call up my insurance to ask them if they'd reimburse me for the OCD treatment).

I know that there are people that have it way worse, but this is my little pity post. Not sure what this could possibly accomplish.

-

i (21) have severe depression and anxiety disorders, i got diagnosed last year after staying in a mental health facility for the first time. this year is the first one ever where i spent the whole year not working. i can't find the motivation and I'm also scared because i fear that any job i start will be as terrible as my last one. 



i got fired last year for a bunch of things, and that's when i knew i had to do find out why i panicked and wanted to walk out whenever a customer showed up, or why I couldn't focus on my job. so i talk to my doctor and ended up with a therapist that referred me to a clinic. it's not technically specified for my problem but i got a spot relatively quickly. i dealt with low self esteem all my life, my father is an alcoholic and a narcissist and i grew up having to take care of myself while also walking on eggshells. lately it feels like it's only gotten worse and there's no one i can talk to. i always feel like the problem child, i don't do anything useful with my life, my older brother is doing so many things and he's really the only one who knows my problems growing up, aside from my therapist but the relationship isn't the same.

What I'm trying to say is, i dont know why but I'm guessing it's a combination of all the things that have gone wrong lately. while drunk again my dad criticized me for being jobless and living on ""easy mode"". my grandfather, who has helped me a lot in regards of moving out and everything else, is pretty irrational and gets irritated quickly. generally i always feel like I'm the burden and it's always my fault. When I was younger I had a brief time of hurting myself, and thought I'd be better off not living.



At the time I thought those weren't thoughts of suicide, but now I know it was passive. i relapsed this year, and i sh more than I ever did. I keep having irrational thoughts that, maybe if i cut too deep or hit something vital, I wouldn't mind dying. i hate talking about it but it's how I feel. i dont like saying it, so writing it down feels better. it's like i know rationally i won't do anything serious, but i also don't like being alive right now. I feel bad telling my therapist i sh again even after doing what he told me and trying to limit my access to sh. 

my family has limited understanding, my parents found out because they saw my injuries when i stayed with them a few months ago. their reactions werent great. they know about my stays at mental health clinics, and my dad says he loves me but I don't feel it. if he does love me, it's not in a way i can understand. his first reaction when he found out i was in a clinic was ""what's this all about, what are you trying to achieve with this nonsense"" i don't know how sober he was, but it keeps playing in my head a lot these days. 

i needed this off my chest and maybe someone who understands me reads it and feels less alone. because you aren't alone in feeling this, even if you think you are. i sure know i feel that way sometimes ";r/depression;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1onsgiw/cant_find_a_reason_to_stay_but_i_also_cant_find/
2025-11-04 07:57:58;Why am I like this?;I’m 29 with two daughters and a great partner for the most part. We have our problems but we’re doing great right now. My kids are great I don’t have to work much but I’m also in school. Why am I so low some days? I don’t want to say I’m sad because I’m not. Idk how to describe it. I feel no motivation to do anything I need to do, which only brings me more stress. I have to force myself to even do the most bare minimum things. I’m not tired I just can’t do anything. I just want to bed rot and play on my phone until the end of time. And then other days I am so happy and can accomplish so much. Why can’t most days just be a happy median of the too? Why am I one or the other? I’m either a really great mom and partner or I’m irritable and worthless. I’ve been diagnosed and have been on meds for a while but it’s like it comes in waves. But I don’t have the stereotypical symptoms so I’ve always thought I wasn’t actually depressed. I still don’t think I am, idk. I just want to be normal. I don’t want to be the happiest person one day and when I wake up the next day everything makes me mad and I cause fights and achieve nothing I need. What do I do? Am I depressed?

2025-11-04 06:06:08;I’m a failure at life;"THIS IS Depression NOT r/advice I DO NOT WANT ADVICE I DO NOT WANT ANYBODY TO TELL ME IT’S OKAY I’M SICK OF HEARING IT’S NOT A BIG DEAL IT’S INVALIDATING IF YOU’RE GONNA SAY THAT DON’T EVEN BOTHER COMMENTING AND YES I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE IT WORSE THAT DOESN’T MEAN I DON’T HAVE IT FUCKING BAD LEAVE IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT

I’m turning 26 this month. I’m a complete failure at life. I’m literally 10 years too late and yes it does matter.

Low paying job, still living at home with my abusive family, no car, no friends, I’ve never had any romantic relationship. I’ve never even held hands with a guy, failed college, informally diagnosed with bipolar (being mentally ill is not trendy and fun).

My life sucks and it’s not okay! I’m sick of hearing it’s okay cause it’s not. At this point I don’t even want to try anymore because it’s too late. I’ve lived in isolated so long and am such a weirdo I don’t know how to form connections with people. I don’t know how to be an adult. When everyone my age is going to school, having a career, having dated for a decade, getting married, moving out. I do nothing.

Unless you are in my exact situation you do not understand how heart breaking and crippling it is to know that you’ve missed out on life and have nothing. It’s even worse knowing that at this point most of my problems are due to me being an idiot and having no spine and no motivation.

Since last year I’ve been seriously considering killing myself getting my things in order and as the time gets closer and closer I keep going back and forth on whether I should die or not but I think I know the answer. I cannot recover from this. I missed out on too much and unless I can go back in time I’ll truly never be happy in life and what’s the point in living if you’re unhappy?";r/depression;0;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1onplzb/im_a_failure_at_life/
2025-11-04 04:55:37;How could I know if things will get better? At all?;"I (22M) got diagnosed with depression in 2021. I'm also autistic. And honestly? As much as I've been getting help and had my ups and downs, I still feel like I'm stuck.

From 2020 to 2023 I was totally hopeless. I don't even remember any highlights from that time. I just had few friends, had no job and was doing pretty badly in college. Then in 2023 I finally made new friends and started a new relationship (which meant everything to me), started doing better in college and played some great shows (I'm a musician). I was doing great for once. In 2024 I started taking antidepressants; I skipped it some days but they helped me at first.

Then this year, specifically last month, everything crumbled again. My gf broke up wtih me and those new friends also cut me off (I made some mistakes, but I feel like they were not enough to warrant cutting me off entirely), and I started falling behind in college again. I kinda feel non-existent again. I keep wondering what would happen if I actually stopped existing, even though I'm not planning on ending myself.

So I wanted to ask, how do depressed people ensure themselves that there's a chance for things to get better? I know it's gotten better before and it can get better again, but it's really hard to keep up.

TLDR: I've been depressed for 4 years, I had many ups and downs, and right now I think I'm at my lowest again. How do I regain my hope?";r/depression;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1onnqel/how_could_i_know_if_things_will_get_better_at_all/

Four years ago, I was diagnosed with depression, and I've never been able to overcome it. I can get what I want, but I feel empty, and my thoughts are blank. If I'm not blank, I think about killing myself, which I don't do because I have people who love me. I've always thought about appreciating my surroundings more, talking to people, finding love. Nothing fulfills me. If I win all the money in the world tomorrow, I don't care. I won't be excited. I feel like nothing matters to me, and yet, at the same time, it does. I can only feel pain. I've tried everything, and I'm still just a piece of meat covered in nerves that does nothing but suffer, and I've accepted it. But my desire to kill myself has been growing stronger, and this worries me, not for myself. I don't care about myself. I care about the people I make happy, even knowing that I'll never feel that way myself. I haven't felt happiness in years; I only fake it. I do it involuntarily.

22M. I don't have the power to fight all of it anymore. I'm tired of living, i just can't function properly and not made to live life, like other people, i feel like a burden to my parents, failing academically and this has become too much. I had suicidal ideation in high school and most of university. Lately everything worsened. I harmed myself, i have already done that in high school, but this time i've gone too far. Blood came out of cuts and scars are big. I live with my parents, so now i'm scared that if they notice it, they're gonna think that i'm a total failure/embarrasment. Desire to end it all gets bigger, the only thing that stops me is my mom. I can't do it while she's alive, plus, i'm a coward and i don't have the guts to go through it.

2025-11-04 00:01:59;By most metrics my life would be considered a success but I feel like a near total failure constantly.;"Some background information on me is I'm a 24M, I live in the Midwest close to the city in a major metro, I was diagnosed with mild cerbal palsy and ADHD in preschool/early elementary school, I graduated college but not with a teaching license which I got this year by passing the test, I currently live at home, and I've never been in a long term relationship.

As the title said I recently passed this test and being a person with ADHD and Cerbal Palsy I should be ecstatic to be at this point and have graduated college compared to stats on people who have both. My mom has said as much and has been a major rock for me to lean on.
Yet despite these successes I can't help but to look at things like my small social circle in and after college and my lafk of dating success with no relationship lasting over two weeks and feel extremely frustrated with myself and like I'm a failure and a burden on those I'm close to. Every since I was on high school I've been good at making surface level friends that I can do small talk with but I always feel weird to try and build a relationship any deeper beyond a few friends I grew up with. This of course becomes harder as we get older and develop other things in our lives.
As for relationships I have developed and gotten better at it since high school but feel way to anxious to approach people in public and only use apps. 
As a man whose taller and been told I'm decent looking 'although I struggle to truly believe it' I've been able to get a decent amount of matches but most don't lead to a date and when they do they've ended in an I don't feel a connection. Which with my ADHD makes me feel like a failure.
I've been in therapy and my therapist has helped me learn to do things to challenge these thoguhts but I feel like theres a decent amount of days I feel like they still push through even with the challenging of them.
I just wish I knew things were eventually gonna work out. Becuase right now it certainly feels like they aren't going to.

2025-11-03 16:17:35;Im feeling hopeless;"Hi, I’m a 21 year old gay male and I think I have depression even though I’ve never been formally diagnosed. I recently stopped going to therapy because I just felt that my therapist wasn’t really telling me anything I didn’t already know and so sessions felt repetitive and pointless. I was going to see a psychologist and then psychiatrist, but then I stopped going altogether, I’m not entirely sure why.

Some things about me: I’ve struggled with my mental health since I was 12, so almost a decade. I’ve been overweight my entire life, lost a good chunk of it, but gained half of it back. I hate my body now because of how big I am and my gynecomastia, and I hated my body then because of my loose skin and gynecomastia. I’m a binge eater and extremely insecure about it—I have no self control with food.

I hate the house I live (with my entire family) and I don’t consider it my home. I hate my financial situation and I hate my job (restaurant cook). I’m going to EMS school to become a paramedic because I want to get away from the place I grew up and because I want to afford some surgeries relating to weight loss, loose skin, gynecomastia, and other cosmetic procedures to help me cope with my insecurities. 

I feel like no matter what I do though, I’ll always be unhappy and hate myself. I’ve never been in love (never been in a relationship) so that makes it hard for me to love myself. Gay dating is so rough and I just gave up. I used to do a good amount of Molly and other stuff when I was 19 to cope, but I’m going to give it up for school and the future job. This is going to sound pathetic, but I’m really upset about having to give it up. I really miss euphoria, it was the only moments where I’ve felt happy, even if it was artificial.

For a moment, when I was going to therapy, I felt excited about life—but now I feel like nothing matters. I’m back to feeling deep in my bones that I am going to die young, because I was just sick of being alive.";r/depression_help;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1on691r/im_feeling_hopeless/

2025-11-02 16:09:42;I need help;"a couple of months ago I went into serious depression (diagnosed with MDD and GAD) where I was in IOP therapy for the better part of three months (yes I missed a third of school). There were a lot of factors that did send me into a spiral, one of which being constant harassment from an old friend. I started sh during that dark few months and I initially thought I was addicted because of the endorphin release.

(Sorry for all the rambling but I really need advice and help). I’m now medicated and I’ve been noticing the effects of it. But all I’m feeling is that I’m medication stable and not genuinely stable. Like I’m being forced to be “stable” and the worst part is I’ve been in depression for so long I’m starting to miss it and crave it. I feel sick and like an attention seeking brat because who wants to have depression, but I’ve become so used to it, it’s the only feeling that feels right to me.

And the sh hasn’t stopped. They said the thoughts would go away except mine is always kinda there and constant. There isn’t a time when a situation pushes me to think “oh I want to self harm” it’s just there. Always in the back of my mind. Some days it’s more quiet but it’s still there.

Now I don’t even know why I self harm. Everyone is telling me to find the root of the problem but what do I do when I don’t even know why I like it? I feel like an attention seeking brat once again cos I feel like my feelings are so atypical of what “normal” people who self harm feel.

Does anyone know why I’m feeling like this? I seem to be in a constant battle of wanting to be depressed and wanting to be better. Should I send myself to another hospital? Am I just always going to be mentally unstable like this? And Im 16 F.";r/depression_help;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1ombtgm/i_need_help/

My doctor offered me meds which I took for a short time and then stop taking due to every single time. I felt happy or good. I just wonder if it all was because of the med it made me feel not real as a person and almost like it was a plastic doll plus the headaches weren’t worth it so I stopped taking them and for the most part  i was fine afterwards I stopped self harming during the summer. I had actually a great one and everything was fine and then I went back to school and for the first month I was OK but the thing is when I get depressed. It’s not like I’m just depressed for a day or two. It’s like my depression has on and off switch. I’ll be in the hallway for instance and randomly. I’ll get so depressed out of nowhere and then like an hour later. I’m perfectly fine and barely even remember I was depressed. Like I’m bouncing off the walls full of energy one minute and then I’m so sad the next I’m wondering if my life is worth it the next 
I start skipping classes when that happens. I don’t know how to explain it when I get so numb. I can barely sit. I just started to cry. After reaching out to my parents. One time I called  my mom breaking down telling her how much I hate school she thought it was faking.  I was perfectly fine two seconds ago and now I have this I’m feeling again because I remembered I have school on Monday and it’s a fucking Saturday. I know it’s on pathetic I do but I have no other way to explain it. The main bad thing about my depression is I can handle the numbness to a certain level. I can’t handle the anger sometimes I’ll get so numb without wanna scream or take my skin off self harmony that was good because I didn’t snap at everybody.

2025-11-01 12:03:24;Still struggling despite everything;"Had depression since before I knew what it was. Stems from a father, who did the best job he could, but was a functional heroin addict due to his own traumatic upbringing and was, at times, physically abusive, hitting me in the face when he didn't like my tone or the way I looked at him. 

At ten years old my family moved from England to New Zealand which was very difficult as we had lived in the same house my entire life up to that point and now we were leaving it behind, along with all my family and friends to live on the other side of the world. I found my niche in life In highschool playing in bands and later went to a music school, where I met my abusive ex girlfriend. She would become angry and upset if I didn't want to have sex or lost my erection and would sometimes turn physical. She punched me in the face, flipped tables and threw chairs. I was a virgin at the time and she was my first real girlfriend outside of highschool so I didn't realize how fucked all this was. She told me I was the problem and I believed her as she was older and more experienced. She was into bdsm and wanted me to hurt her so she would start fights with me so she could get off on it. That's how she explained it. I tried talking to my dad and my best friend at the time and they told me to ""man up"" and that they would ""never let a woman hit me"". This relationship, combined with porn use from a young age, crippled my ability to have physical intimacy. I would have full panic attacks when people would try come on to me. Years later I would be diagnosed with PTSD after speaking to a therapist. 

After it finally ended, I had a long string of unstable relationships with other people who were mentally ill.One of which stalked me, sent me death threats and threatened to ""curse me in [her] blood under the next full moon"". During all this, my mother who is my favorite person, got cancer and while she was battling it both her parents died and my father cheated on her with multiple women. This finally ended their 40 year relationship with a bitter and still ongoing divorce. 

I do have good things in my life like my beautiful partner, my mum and 3 years of  sobriety after being a heavy drinker since my teenage years. But despite this, going to the gym 4 times a week, going to therapy and AA meetings Im still terribly depressed and I've recently been getting worse.

2025-10-30 22:05:24;I can’t stop comparing my life to other peoples lives.;"When I was 19 years old, I became pregnant. It wasn’t planned at all. Me and my boyfriend were living at my parents house, we hadn’t finished school and we were working. I took a pregnancy test with my boyfriend as we were suspecting something was different about me. When the test came out positive, I broke down. All I could think about was how my life was over and that my parents were going to kick me out of the house. I stayed in my room for the next couple of days, crying my eyes out, stressing about how I was going to tell my parents.

When I told my parents, well, their reaction was somewhat as I expected. They wanted me to have an abortion. I hadn’t made a decision about if I wanted to keep the baby or not, but I wasn’t going to have an abortion just because someone else wanted me to. Days went by, and my mother kept reminding me everyday that she desperately wanted me to have an abortion.

Then I made my decision, I was going to keep the baby. Me and my boyfriend moved out of my parents house and bought an apartment, not the greatest one out there, but it works for the 3 of us. I didn’t tell any of my friends I was pregnant until I was 20 weeks.

Throughout my pregnancy I was extremely depressed and I felt very lonely most of the time. I quit school and started to work full time.

Giving birth ended up being really traumatic. Physical recovery took a long time. Me and my boyfriend started fighting a lot. My friends were out having their time of their lives. My parents weren’t being really supportive. Then I was diagnosed with postpartum depression.

Today I am 20 years old. I am on medication for my depression. I still feel alone. Me and my boyfriend fight often. My baby is 5 months old and I don’t feel much connected to him. Me and my parents aren’t that close. In conclusion, I hate my life.

When I scroll down social media and see posts like pregnancy announcements, engagement and wedding pictures, other people buying a new apartment/house etc, I break down crying. I want what other people have.

I was always so excited to become pregnant later in life and be able to surprise my boyfriend with a positive pregnancy test, and to see his reaction. Then tell my friends and family and see everyone’s happy faces. But I had none of that. I’m so jealous of others. I can’t stop comparing my own life to others, and think about how other people have it so much better than me.

Call me dramatic and immature. But this is just how I feel.";r/depression_help;7;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1ok0n5u/i_cant_stop_comparing_my_life_to_other_peoples/
2025-10-29 06:54:16;Wellbutrin seems to be worsening my anxiety and intrusive thoughts and actions;"I’ve been on bupropion the last three months. At first my dose was 150mg, but in the last month and a half it was upped to 300mg. All was fine, until recently I’ve been noticing a very drastic change in my mood. My anxiety is to the point. I feel constantly in flight or flight mode and can get to it super quickly even though i couldve been previously at a neutral level. 

I was diagnosed as a child chronic depression, but have never had the intrusive suicidal thoughts before until now. I was able to function completely fine even through my depression but now it feels like it’s greatly interrupting my life, and courses, as well as my responsibilities as a mom. 

For some context I was put on it since 2023 for severe postpartum, but wasn’t taking it consistently until this year, after fluoxetine wasn’t working for me anymore. 

I feel like I get so irrationally angry, and have been lashing out when my usual reaction is the complete opposite of that. I’m still going through postpartum, but it feels like it was getting better and stable, but now after the dose increase- I feel like I’m just a couple of baby steps from spiraling. Although I do attribute a lot of this anxiety due to family issues with my own family member having had gone through their own mental health crisis that landed them in the hospital. 

A reason why I feel stuck and intrusive thoughts is because of a very strained dynamic between my mother and I, who had a history of disregarding my mental health as not serious due to it not being outwardly noticeable. I don’t feel comfortable speaking to her about, and don’t have any friends who I can talk to about this. 

I am seeing a therapist once a week, but I don’t have a psychiatrist and have been receiving  my medication through my doctor, who I don’t see until the end of next month. 

I apologize for the long post, but I feel very stuck in this dark head space.

I've found that I just think about ending it. I don't really know what to do or how to survive this. I'm trying to keep things fun and ok for my kids and every time I'm alone (I work from home) I think, maybe I'll just be done today.

She's diagnosed with depression and it looks like lately, she has been thinking a lot about ending it and it's making me worry so much. I love her a lot. She has been my best friend since elementary school. She's like a sister to me and I want to do everything I can to prevent her from thinking about ending things. 

What can I do for her while we're countries apart? I am also not financially well so I can't do anything using money. Any suggestions? I wanted to suggest that she finally get medicated for depression but I also know that it doesn't always work and might make things worse for her. Please help me. I don't want to lose her.

2025-10-28 00:59:33;can‘t get out of this funk after being sick;"hey all!

the past few weeks have been hell for me. i was extremely sick- ended up in the ER (was mostly ignored, but that‘s not the point here) and they diagnosed me with an upper respiratory virus. i was sick for two and a half weeks where i didn‘t leave my dorm and didn‘t go to class. for reference, i‘m a college freshman. 

now i don‘t want to go to class. i‘ve missed assignments, which is something i haven‘t done since i was a sophomore in high school. my roommate smokes weed, and i have an addictive personality along with addiction running in my family, and i‘m so afraid i‘ll fall into that and use it as a way to ignore all my problems. 

i WANT to get better. i WANT to do my assignments and go to class. i love school, i always have, but i can‘t get over myself. my best friend is helping me- we went hiking last sunday and it felt like nothing was wrong and that i could do it. but i was wrong. i need advice, something i can do to just get over myself because i KNOW that i want to do it. i just can‘t get out of bed. i‘ve been diagnosed and medicated for about a year and a half, and most of the time i‘m fine! but sometimes a wave comes and i feel like i can‘t see the end of the tunnel. 

any advice is greatly appreciated, and this is the first time i‘m reaching out before it gets worse/serious ❤️";r/depression_help;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1ohjxpl/cant_get_out_of_this_funk_after_being_sick/
2025-10-27 22:15:22;My life;"I dont remember the last time I was truly happy. Its not because I had a bad childhood or anything, I think it it because Ive always felt different. Not because I was or am, but becasue I couldnt help but always feel like I didnt belong. I was still happy though, even though my feelings were always invalidaded, I was never the first choice, and was bullied once, twice or ten times. Ive always been happy though. As a kid I didnt care. I only cared about grades and what tv show I was going to watch to sleep. I liked that about myself. I. didnt. care. I was happy nevertheless. Even if I didnt have much friends or if I didnt see my mom  for a few days because she was busy working. Even if it hurt, it wouldnt last long, I would just go back to my innocent self. But that all did end up affecting me in the end. Thats why I died at 9 years old.

I really dont know when I started to view things differently. But when puberty hit, life changed. When I was 10 it when I kinda realized I was tired of getting my feelings hurt. I started being really self concious. Then at 11 I got diagnosed with severe (social) anxiety. I really could make a whole seperate post dedicate to my social anxiety and how it ruined my life. But to make the long story short, it was a very hard period in my life because everything became so hard. I started going to both a psychologist and a psychiatrist and started taking meds. 6 grade was rough. I did end up liking it in the end because I got comfortable with my class. My social anxiety isnt as bad anymore, I actually can be very extrovered at time and I dont get panic attack anymore. I jst felt like if I was going to talk about how shitty my life is I felt like it was necessary to mention when mental health became a serious topic for me and my life.

Nothing really happend the next year, just the usual anxiety and stress, but there is a moment that I feel like I should mention. I was having this mental breakdown (doesn't matter why) and for the first time I actually wanted to k1ll myself. In past I did have some thoughts like ""I dont wanna be here"". But this was different. This time I **felt it**. For the first time in my life I felt like I was **feeling too much** and that I dont want to keep doing this.

Anyway it wont be a shock to say that that summer I was diagnosed with severe depression. Worst summer of my life. Also to make matters worse, I became addicted to self-harm. Not much to say about that, just that it became the start of something that I dont know when it will end.The following school year was full of relaspses. It when it was coming to the end I had one of the worst relaspes I've had. Like I was doing so good and then school just had to fuck it all up. Well, safe to say I was also very much depressed that summer. I actually feel bad for my self because I thought it couldnt possibly get worse than that. Surprise, yes it fucking can.

Freshmen year was absolute hell. But it is also a year I will never ever forget. It will always remind me that even though im dying, I am so strong. I had an attempt not even 2 weeks after school started. And let me tell you I will never forget that night. The next 3 months were actually pretty decent, but then I dont know what happend but I became so fucking depressed on january its crazy. That led me to get diagnosed with BPD (bordeline personality disorder). And that explained a whole lot. But yeah, I missed a lot of school, fought a lot with my mother, and had to take summer school because I missed so much class. I was that depressed.

It may surprise you but that summer wasnt actually too bad. Like I was pretty much fine . Then sophomore year started and guess who relapsed after almost 3 months clean. ME. Yeah, this is me now. I gonna go to residencial treatment soon cause it has gotten that bad. I'm still really depressed and su1c1dal. Like I have never been so fucking sad in my life it is insane. I really dont know if I'm gonna gratuate and I really want to attempt. Thank you if you read all of this.";r/depressed;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1ohfk6g/my_life/
2025-10-27 14:06:51;i just can’t;"TW: suicidal ideation and self harm

this is honestly kinda just a rant/vent so to anyone who sees this i’m not gonna be trying to use like proper punctuation and grammar. 

i just turned fifteen like a week ago and leading up to my birthday i wasn’t excited. on my birthday i wasn’t excited. after my birthday i wasn’t excited. everything just feels so like monotone and uninteresting and unexciting. i’ve felt like this for almost three years so it’s not like “omg im feeling like this out of nowhere and have no idea what is happening” or anything like that. i’m not diagnosed because i’ve never been to a therapist or talked to a doctor about my mental health but im pretty sure that this is depression, all the symptoms line up and have since i was 12. it’s just that lately it’s been kinda different. like the first few months i was depressed, it was the worst i’ve been (so far), either that or i’ve just gotten so used to feeling this way, but anyways i would still be fake happy then and all that shit but i would still be like actually happy around my sister most the time. i would have no problem listening to her and talking and stuff and i would isolate myself but i feel like i wasn’t isolating too too much (honestly cause i kinda couldn’t). but its kinda different now. i love my sister with all of my heart but i just find it harder to engage in what we talk about now or really just in any and every conversation that i have with anyone. i’m just getting more easily irritated and i hate it. i’ve ignored my dads texts and calls, my grandma’s texts and calls, even when both of them were just trying to make plans for something to do for my birthday. i’m ignoring texts from my nana and auntie wishing me happy birthday right now. and i hate myself for it right now. i hate myself so much for it right now because i love all of them and i don’t want to push any of them away but i just can’t do any of this right now. like just thinking about school or talking or smiling makes me want to genuinely cry. i hate myself so badly. and ive been lying to my sister for almost like two fucking years cause when she found out i self harmed in 2024 i told her i would stop and i did for a bit but i started again not even long after that b cause i jus don’t even want to get better. and me knowing that i don’t want to get better just makes everything worse cause it’s like why am i not just killing myself yet? and school just makes it all so much worse and i genuinely think if i have to go through another fucking week of school (which i will) then im jus gonna kill myself because i can’t do it anymore. anyways that’s not all im just tired of typing

I was diagnosed a few months ago with severe depression and bipolar disorder. Lately, things have been getting really heavy — my thoughts have been loud, constant, and painful. Today it all felt like too much to handle, and I reached a point where I tried to end my life.

My younger sister found me and stopped me. My family panicked and rushed me to a clinic, and I was told that things could’ve been much worse. Seeing my family’s faces after that — the fear, the sadness — was a feeling I can’t even describe. My friends are staying with me tonight, and even though I’m surrounded by people, I still feel numb and lost inside.

I guess I just wanted to share this because I don’t know what comes next. I feel ashamed, scared, and at the same time, a small part of me is relieved that I’m still here.

2025-10-26 18:12:25;i don't know what to do with my life;"Hi i'm 25F, i've been suffering with my mental health since i was little and was officially diagnosed with depression, anxiety, cptsd, ocd and eating disorders just to name a few... I'm here because at this point i've been stuck for years at the same point of my life and no matter what i do or how i try to get helpin the end nothing really changes.

I've always had a depressive mood and outlook on life (dysthymia) and that's never going to change but in the past i was able to appear somewhat functional. I've been in therapy for years and it really did help me to a point, i even started to take antidepressants a few years ago but i still can't get myself to leave this state of persistent depression. No matter the therapist (i had to change a few) or the medication (i tried different antidepressants at different dosages), i recognize that i'm now in a much better mental space but i still feel like there's something missing in order to take that final step towards a ""normal"" life.

Is this how i'm supposed to live my life? When i was little i used to dream of doing so many things but now i'm apathetic to everyting. My family has given up on me a long time ago, they just accomodate me and try to look the other way when things get too ugly. I have no friends nor am i capable of making any at this point. The only thing that's keeping me together is the fact that i have to finish uni and get my damn degree.

How are you guys capable of pushing forward? How is it possible to keep going when everything has failed you? I tried to do all the right things, i've read countless suggestions on how to get out of a depressive cycle, i've tried to get my life back together so many times but in the end i realized that it's simply too difficult for me. I have no motivation and i'm unable to find any, the only thing keeping me here is my stubbornness and the fact that i'm absolutely terrified of death. When i look back and see the time i spent doing nothing i feel powerless.

Has anyone ever been in such a situation? Is it really possible to get out? And how am i supposed to do so when everything i tried has failed? I just realized how long this post has become and i'm sorry for the rant but i wanted to get everything out in the open.

2025-10-25 19:47:28;Stuck in the past and freeze response;"Hello everyone,
I’m a 25-year-old lawyer. I graduated at 23 from one of the best law schools in my country, and completed my legal internship at one of the most prestigious law firms in my city. I had great relationships there, but because I started a master’s degree and felt overwhelmed, I decided not to continue working there.

While studying for my master’s degree, I opened my own law office. My family covers the office expenses, but I keep losing money every month because I can’t find clients. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with major depression, and I’m currently taking 20 mg of Cipralex.

During the day, I often experience a “freeze response” — I just stare at the walls and can’t move. I sleep a lot and want to be alone. I often think about suicide, and the thought of it brings a strange sense of relief. I constantly imagine that I never left the law firm where I interned, or that I went back to my high school years.

My favorite activity has become lying in a dark room, falling asleep to the background noise of cartoons. Every month, my family pays my office rent and taxes. They say they’re okay with helping me, but the uncertainty of the future and my lack of belief make me not want to continue anymore.

I don’t want to get out of bed or fight anymore. I feel trapped — living in fantasies of going back to the past or imagining my own death.

I’m still seeing my psychiatrist, but I don’t know how to cope with these thoughts anymore. I just want to know if anyone here has been through something similar and found a way to feel alive again.";r/depression_help;4;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1ofpiua/stuck_in_the_past_and_freeze_response/
2025-10-23 12:49:14;(TW: SH, abuse) Sick and alone, mentally degrading;"Back to writing my thoughts to reddit, because I am unsure of where else to post them to. I don't know how to summarize my feelings, as there are a lot, so I assume this is going to be as disjointed and rambling as my mental state is.



I'm tired. I'm sick and tired. Sick and tired of being sick and tired. I have something medically wrong with me and no amount of paranoid doctor visits my entire life has ever actually found anything wrong with me. I believe all of them are a bunch of small things adding up to debilitate me, so they really feel like ""first world problems"" compared to other people who are actually dying of cancer or something. I don't know what's wrong with me. Starting in 2018, I developed what I assume is severe indigestion related issues. I say ""I assume"" because I went to the hospital 7 times in 2018, three times in one month I think, for what I thought was a stroke or heart attack and they never found anything. I was completely fine. My indigestion isn't bothering me as much right now, but I felt a need to mention it to point out I have become adjusted to near constant stomach pain and vomiting even with antacids and changing diet.



I have no been diagnosed, but I am a severe hypochondriac. The kind you'd see in cartoons who will have a panic attack if they get near 10ft of a strange chemical or smell, or feel something strange with their body. What's worse, I have a hypochondria so severe, I will manifest the symptoms of what I think is killing me. Stroke or heart attack for example. I went to the ER 7 times mostly because the left side of my body goes entirely numb randomly. I can move it, but I can't feel it much for short periods of time. Never had a stroke according to the hospital and it sometimes goes away if I ignore it.



This needs to be pointed out because my brain is clearly mentally killing me and is against me. I have no control over it. I have a bizarre mental state that has never left me. I have been suicidal since I was 9, this is paired with paranoid delusions I am dead or have died. This has never left me, I know in reality I am alive, but the desire to die never goes away.



Case in point: being sick constantly I will occasionally feel happiness and hope I will finally be allowed to die. And then periods of depression when I wake up and having not died. The issue is: I am suicidal but a hypochondriac. MY brain is basically it's own entity. So I cannot enjoy believing I will die, because it activates my flight or fight and gives me permanent anxiety. So I cannot have peace.

2025-10-20 19:27:01;Where to now? Suggestions would be appreciated;"I have had depression and anxiety for most of my life.  I have tried (and gone to) maximum dosages of Zoloft, Prozac, Luvox, Ciprimil (let me know if you need the active ingredient names), mirtazapine, and I’m now on Pristiq. 

All of them have stopped working. Pristiq I started at 50mg and I’m currently on 150mg. My psychiatrist wants to put it up to 200mg which I don’t want due to several reasons - one is that it is causing me to sweat a lot and secondly it’s just killed any sex drive I had. Also I know that it will stop working and then comes the fun time of weaning off it.

  
The reason why the psychiatrist wants to put it up is that I’ve had a relapse of depression and anxiety. I am overwhelmed, cry lots, can’t seem to get off the couch, hate going into public.

I am also on Valium and propanol to control anxiety as needed. 

Testing last year revealed that I’m very likely to be autistic and adhd, however an official diagnosis is out of reach cost wise for now. So is psychology. In the past I’ve done CBT and it probably helped short term, but I just rebound back. 

I actually trialled ritalin today (my son had some left over before he switched to concerta) and it was honestly the best day I had in a while. No anxiety, I felt calm and focused, not completely overwhelmed, which is a common theme for me these days.

  
Short story long, does anyone have suggestions on what to trial next. I will be talking to her about my Ritalin trial (she might not be too happy about that but oh well), but any other suggestions for even augmenting pristiq would be appreciated.

2025-10-19 18:55:41;Strategies to leave the house (lack of interest/motivation + anxiety);"tldr: most days, I find it extremely hard to do my morning routine and get out of the house. I feel a heaviness on my chest and a generalised lack of care for any negative consequences (job loss, friend loss, etc). Please, tell me strategies and tricks that worked for you! 

I have been diagnosed with major chronic depression for almost 20 years now. Recently, as my depressive cycles were too short, I got diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly a lot of my moods and behaviours made much more sense. Still, I need help because I can't break out of this chronic pattern of not leaving my house... 

In detail...

Getting out of bed itself is hard but I found tricks that help and most of the time, I manage to move myself to the kitchen and make coffee, breakfast+take my meds (motivational trick, I am hungry and love coffee...). 

Then the problems start: if I don't feel well (chest heaviness, anhedonia), I cuddle up on the kitchen couch and never leave it. I don't care about the world or consequences. As so I cannot argue with myself about what's a ""good or bad behaviour"", trick myself into ""baby steps"" , listen to my boyfriend's pleas for me to move... 

Even if I feel ok, it's extremely hard to get dressed and ready to leave. I already reduced my commute from 1h to 35 min by driving an electric scooter to work, but still the thought of that mindless routine, spent on traffic, gives me a feeling like I'm going to throw up... 

If I manage to get out though, even if driving is boring, it's never as bad as I made it to be. Then, work is actually pleasurable most of the times and it's hard for me to leave at a decent time because 1) I'm into it (hyperfocus),  2) guilt for days missed/being late, 3) fear of the next day not being able to ""remember"" how I enjoy work, and 4) the boredom of the drive back. 

In the middle of all this, I'd like to incorporate enjoyable hobbies like swimming, sauna, friends, etc., but I don't have the time or energy after all the struggles with getting out of the house everyday. 
Fortunately, my boss is very understanding and I'm a good worker when I'm present; still, I'm on thin ice and might end up losing my job over this. 

Please, have you been through the same and what tricks got you out of it? Or anything that helped really...

I am 24 years old, I am an active addict (mostly stimulants) and I have been suicidal and depressive since I was 12-13 y/o. 
Lately a lot of things happened to me and my only coping mechanism has been getting high and drunk. 
I do not anticipate life although I have a fairly okay job, my family is okay (kinda) and the only thought in my mind is that I do not want to fight that battle of going through life.
I’ve done lost my ambition, my passion for whatever, I do not see my close friends because all I do is work and get fd up and this is so disappointing on myself but I mostly keep it to me. 
I fake emotions and empathy because sometimes I am truly unable to express my emotions whatsoever. 
I am aware that I might be sociopathic and this has always kept me from the idea of wanting kids. I do not want kids and to reproduce my fd up genes and make another victim of those genetics. 
My absent father is diagnosed bipolar and my bigger brother also used to abuse drugs and had schizophrenic episodes and this is the main reason I do not want kids.
I just discovered that my ex got pregnant 1 month after we broke up after almost 4 years of relationship and I told her I might kill myself. 
I do not know what to do, what specialist to reach and even if it’s fixable.
What can I do about my constant pain and will to die? 
Am I just being dramatic or this is really something I should be worried about.

To add things on to this, my procrastination is now worse than ever, I feel depressed and dead inside. I have tried to get mental help this semester but procrastinated on paperwork and now can’t get any services for weeks.

I can’t do alternatives because I live with my parents, they’re extremely conservative, perfectionist and don’t even believe in therapy or mental health. They also yelled at me and my Autistic brother a lot as a child, even over the tiniest of mistakes…

There can be times where they’re sweet and caring but even as an adult they still get mad and yell at me over my grades because they think I should always get a B or over. They claim they want to help and while that seems to be their intent, their methods of helping me are by scaring me, guilt-tripping me and shaming me. They don’t hurt me physically but they’re extremely emotionally unstable and toxic. They don’t listen to my concerns because they only listen to their own toxic worldview. I haven’t told them about the grade drop but I will have to…

I have no mental health alternatives and no other places to go or stay without my parents finding out and possibly kicking me out of the house. I have overcame some of the emotional hold my parents had over me but now I have nothing left to motivate me to do well in college… I feel empty inside with non-existent motivation and feel like I failed my math professor who was really nice to me…

For the record, I am an up and coming artist and writer who was hoping to produce and post works on the internet. However, I am considering if I should ditch that entirely and focus on college work exclusively but I don’t even know if that will even work or make me even more miserable now…

I just don’t know what to do… I was diagnosed with ADD as a child and I highly suspect I have OCD and potentially also Anxiety and judging by my currents feelings, I may possibly have Depression.

A Day in My Head
Night / Early Morning
Sleep doesn’t feel like sleep, and somehow one can say it is not what can be considered normal sleep. My brain keeps working all night long, and it’s not just simple daily worries or planning tomorrow briefly — no, it can go on all night. And unfortunately for me, it’s not only structure and plans; it replays everything that has happened. Random moments. Things from today. Things from years ago. I overthink all of it, even while dreaming.
My dreams reflect my fears: nightmares of being chased, being hurt, or losing my boyfriend. Or just endless replays of things I overthink all day, or have overthought all my life. Fear follows me into sleep — always finding a way to replicate itself.
I wake up multiple times with the burning thought: if I don’t write this down right now, I’ll lose it forever, and everything will go wrong. Half-asleep, I get up. My supposed OCD insists: capture the idea perfectly, in the right order. If I don’t, it won’t feel right anymore.
Even when I don’t remember the dream images, my body remembers. I wake up tense, heart pounding, muscles tight, like I ran a marathon in my sleep. That’s PTSD: quiet, always there, lingering in the background.
I don’t always feel safe, even with doors locked. I lock them anyway — for structure, for control. But when the unsafe feeling hits, I need someone on the phone. The only person I want in those moments is my boyfriend — the only person who sees this side of me that no one else does. Even then, I struggle with how much I need him.
I hate asking for help. I hate being turned down. I hate feeling weak, even though I know needing help isn’t weakness, I still hate how people might view me for needing support. Yet sometimes, being vulnerable is the only option — the only way to survive the rush of fear and the waves of tension. In those moments, needing him isn’t a choice. It’s survival.
Morning
Mornings start with exhaustion. Depression makes my body heavy, whispering: why bother? Supposed OCD nags: brush your teeth, wash your face — do it right or don’t do it at all. Most mornings, I’m too tired to even move properly. Skipping these routines makes me feel ten times worse — the frustration burns inside.
I don’t rush to my phone in the mornings anymore.
BPD and depression taught me that silence hurts less than disappointment.
Most of the people I loved have drifted away — or maybe I drove them there, in one of my storms.
Now, I only replay echoes of what I said, what I shouldn’t have said, what I wish I could undo.
It’s a lonely ritual — reliving connections that no longer exist.
Every unread message feels like proof that I’m too much, or not enough.
Afternoon
I try to get tasks done. ADHD scatters me — jumping from dishes to laundry to cleaning to scrolling — never finishing. Supposed OCD pushes me to structure everything: write the list, make it perfect, follow the order exactly. But sometimes the list becomes longer than the task itself, trapping me in planning instead of doing.
Depression drags me down: You’ll never finish, so why try?
Anxiety whispers: If you don’t finish, things will go wrong, and people will be disappointed.
PTSD surfaces in sudden waves — a noise, a memory, or just a feeling — and my body tenses automatically. I shake it off, but the exhaustion lingers.
BPD stirs inside. Small mistakes or lapses trigger intense self-criticism: You’re careless. You always mess up. No one sees this storm, but inside it rages.
Evening
By night, I often feel unsafe alone. The quiet amplifies the tension. Doors locked or unlocked, it doesn’t always matter — the feeling comes in waves. I call someone to stay on the phone until I fall asleep. Needing someone can make me feel exposed and vulnerable, but it’s the only way I can calm the rush of fear.
ADHD still jumps around in my mind. Supposed OCD still whispers: make the list perfect for tomorrow. Anxiety hums quietly but persistently in the background. Depression keeps reminding me: you wasted today, tomorrow will be worse.
Even when the fear fades, I’m mentally drained and physically tired — carrying the weight of all these voices quietly inside.
When the Depression Deepens
Some days, I can’t even make the list. My brain wants it — the perfect structure, the order, the routine. But depression is heavier than any routine. I run out of spoons before the day even begins. Just existing feels impossible.
I lie there, thinking: If I can’t make the list, I can’t start. And if I can’t start, everything will fall apart. The thought eats at me. But even picking up the pen feels like lifting a mountain.
Doing nothing makes me more depressed — the guilt, the shame, the voice saying I’ve wasted another day. But trying to do something feels half impossible. My body is too tired, my head too heavy. Even sleep feels impossible — like using up a spoon I don’t have. I’m too exhausted to rest, too depleted to gain energy from rest.
And even if I start, supposed OCD whispers: it won’t be perfect, so why even bother?
After a while, the tug-of-war burns me out so much that my brain shifts into procrastination mode. It doesn’t want to work. It refuses. Even when the task is simple, even when the answer is right there, my brain hits a wall. Perfectionism anxiety, social anxiety — they pile on until my brain just says no.
Sometimes it shows up in little ways: I might know someone’s name but say the wrong one. I stumble over words, fight with speech, and it feels like my brain and my mouth don’t match. Yes, I’m dyslexic — but this goes deeper. It’s exhaustion. It’s my brain being too tired to work, even when I desperately want it to.
And then there’s the fog. It started with short-term memory loss — forgetting little things, small moments. But now it seeps deeper into long-term memory. Whole pieces of my past feel blurred or lost, as if I never lived them. It’s like my brain is slowly erasing the evidence of me. And when I try to recall, it’s not just frustrating — it feels like I’m fading.
The truth is, I once had so many dreams. But now, I’ve reached a state where I don’t even feel like I exist. And yet, I can’t die. So instead, I convince myself to have dreams again. For a week, the spark comes back — hope, motivation, maybe even purpose. But after a week, the conclusion always returns: what’s the point?
Everything feels like a chore — even happiness. What sense does it make to want to achieve goals? What sense does it make to exist at all? Where is the worth?
So I remind myself, again and again, to hold on. To try. To believe in something. But even that cycle is exhausting. Even explaining how deep it goes feels too heavy, like it would drain the last bit of energy I have left.
The Reflection — Losing and Holding On
By the end of the day, the exhaustion isn’t just physical. It’s mental, emotional, spiritual. My head feels too foggy, my body too heavy, my heart too tired.
Once, writing was my escape. My piece of peace. Words used to flow like water, and in them I could find myself — shape myself — feel alive. But now, even that feels gone. I’m too drained to let my emotions out through pen or screen. Too tangled to bring chaos into clarity.
So I do what I can: I speak. I let some of it out loud. Somehow it’s easier that way, like loosening the knots in my chest with less of the weight of dragging them across a page. And even then, I need help — a little writer leaning on ChatGPT to hold the pen for me.
That truth aches. It makes me feel like I’ve lost the core of me, that I can’t even do the thing that once made me whole. And the guilt comes rushing in: if I let someone else shape my words, are they still mine? If I can’t pour it out myself, have I failed?
And I know myself — until I rewrite it fully, until my hand reshapes every sentence, this story will stay in fragments, in little bits of remodifications. This paragraph, that phrase, this turn of thought. Over and over, until it feels right. Until it feels mine. Even though it already is. Even though it’s my own voice, my own truth.
For now, this is me holding on. With my voice. With my truth. With my exhaustion. With my fight.
The Paradox of Me
I am too emotional, yet somehow too emotionless.
I feel everything too deeply until suddenly, I feel nothing at all.
My heart floods and dries out in the same breath — too full, too empty, never just enough.
I am something and its opposite, constantly shifting between both.
I am the problem, yet I know every solution.
I can trace every pattern, understand every reason, name every fear —
but when it comes to fixing it, I freeze.
It’s like I can see the path, but my feet won’t move.
Like I’m locked inside my own understanding.
I contradict myself in every direction.
I crave closeness but fear being seen.
I want to be happy, but I guess depression has become my new identity.
I want a calm, steady life — but has it already lost its meaning in the middle of the chaos?
My mind knows better; my heart just won’t listen.
Sometimes I think I might be the most self-aware delusional person alive.
I see myself from the outside — analyze every thought, dissect every feeling,
understand every contradiction — yet still fall into the same patterns, the same pain.
It’s like being both the scientist and the experiment, both the doctor and the disease.
I know exactly what’s happening inside me, but that knowledge doesn’t save me.
It just makes me more aware of how trapped I am —
in my own labyrinth, where everything feels so familiar. You think you’ll save yourself, but somehow you don’t — and in my case, I’m just familiar with the maze that is my mind.
Awareness without control feels like its own kind of madness.
And maybe that’s my curse — or maybe it’s my truth:
to live as both the healer and the broken one.
To be the calm and the storm.
To know exactly what I need, yet never quite reach it.
And maybe that’s what I am — a paradox in progress.
A person built of opposites, trying to make them coexist.
Trying to be whole in the middle of contradiction.
Trying, still, to hold on.
And maybe that’s the real paradox after all — not just who I am, but what I can and cannot accept. The understanding and the denial, the control and the collapse, the reaching and the retreating — all of it living under the same skin. Maybe I’m meant to live in the in-between, to keep learning how to hold both truth and confusion, both love and fear, both the calm and the storm. Because maybe that’s what it means to be me — a contradiction that still breathes, a paradox that still hopes, a broken thing that still tries.
Or maybe that’s just another day of being a borderline. The Mirror of Me
I guess it’s only fair to talk a little about me.
After all, people are taking the time — the ones who will really get this, or get a chance to read it. Some of them might know me, some might not.
Let’s start with the easy stuff that probably everyone knows.
Right now, I’m 21 — that’s the general knowledge.
Now, onto the more unknown parts: the diagnoses.
I’ve been psychiatrically diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, and PTSD. My supposed OCD, though, was first noticed and “diagnosed” by people around me. Some thought it was because I was overly clean. Others noticed my need for structure and routine — how without it, I crumble.
Some of them were even my Erziehers — my caregivers or supervisors at boarding school. At least, that’s how I remember it. I think they said it, or maybe my roommates and dormmates did. Either way, someone noticed. My brain is weird like that — it remembers feelings more clearly than words.
But somehow, sometimes it remembers words more than feelings. And I overtalk, trying to feel something — anything — just to feel human again. Because sometimes, I feel like a robot.
It’s funny how many people know different versions of me.
Some know the version of me who couldn’t cry even if I wanted to — unless it was something devastating, like a death.
Others know the overly emotional version, which is actually quite recent and seems to surface only in love.
And then there are the ones who know me as obsessively clean — while others know the depressed version of me, the one who can’t get out of bed but still insists on being “clean.”
And then there’s my former best friend — who, to me, will always be my best friend. I shared some of my thoughts with her, and she’s an OCD-er. I guess I have more in common with her than I ever realized. I always knew we were similar, but this… this exceeded what I imagined.
The last person is my boyfriend — he’s a doctor who worked in emergency psychiatry. He didn’t see me there, but he saw me during a mental breakdown. He saw me unfiltered — the chaos, the spiraling, the stillness after the storm. He didn’t diagnose me; he just saw me. And somehow, that was enough. Somehow, that’s how he understood.
I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I know my life is hard — I complain about it, I overthink it. Maybe that’s why I wanted a diagnosis: because knowing the general umbrella helps me understand myself, helps me keep some sense of control. But sometimes, that diagnosis feels too heavy — too big for me.
I’ve always correlated OCD with being one of the hardest disorders to live with. And I know my life is hard. I fit the criteria painfully well in some ways, but somehow, I still can’t fully wrap my head around having it.
And yet, at other times, I can see it — clearly, almost painfully so.
Maybe that’s just another piece of me — the knowing and the not knowing, both fighting to exist.";r/depressed;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1o7nypg/help_me_help_someone_i_care_for/
2025-10-16 04:29:01;How to get out of depression? even if its a tiny bit. Help;"Hello, I could need some advice/tips/help.  
  
This text might be a bit long, so I’m sorry and if anyone reads this, thank you.  
Also I never write such long texts in english, so hopefully everything is understandable.

I’m 24 years old and im sitting here, still struggling with major depression (first diagnosed when I was 16 or 17). It started when I was 11 or 12.   
  
So far the only thing that’s ever really helped were the pills.  
I also had social anxiety, but it got a lot better after spending some time in clinics. Still, there are some leftovers.

I think some people might know this feeling. That one day where you suddenly have the motivation to change things. I’m at that point. I just don’t know how to keep it up. Everything drains me, even the simplest things.  
I don’t have a psychologist. Where I live, there isn’t a single one nearby. The closest are 30–60 minutes away by car, and I can’t drive. Taking a bus or train would be too much for me to handle.

Every obstacle makes things worse and harder to keep going. I even missed 5 or 6 appointments with my psychiatrist, and its literally just a 15-minute walk away.  
Besides that, my psychiatrist is not good. He kind of ignores what I say, changes the subject, and talks about himself or my favorite so far, about the pharmaceutical industry.

For example, he once said, “You’re young, I’m old.. how can you not be able to walk for 15 minutes? I do it every day.”  
He can’t read well because of his eyesight, so he never checks the documents beforehand, which means he asks me the same questions every time.

It’s honestly a joke, and I’m sick of it. I’ve had so many bad experiences with different doctors, and my biggest problem is that I avoid conflicts at all costs. I just can’t deal with confrontation, it’s always been like that. I just take what I get, which is a huge problem in all of this.

My general practitioner is kind of the same.   
She was the one who gave me a referral to my current psychiatrist. In her opinion, people that young can’t be depressed and just need to “do something.”

Daily life is rough too. Everything just builds up until I can’t handle it anymore, and I reach my limit really fast.  
I live with my girlfriend and two kids, so things aren’t getting easier. She does a lot.  
Cooking is usually what I do most of the time, and I help her here and there.  
We go out with the kids ...at least that kind of works.

Low motivation, always tired, emotionless, its just like there’s nothing.  
I’m not dead, but I’m not living either.  
Sometimes it feels like I don't have depressions, its just literally me. Like, the depression is my personality. Idk.

If it matters, I don’t eat super unhealthy, it could be better, but I pay attention to protein and eat some fruits and vegetables. I take supplements: multivitamins, B12 because vegan, D3 + K2, and a few others.  
I also do some calisthenics, though very irregularly. I'm not overweight.

TL;DR  
Living in a small city with only a few doctors. The ones I have aren’t good or don’t take me seriously. Not sure where to get help or how to stay motivated or get better.

So, how to you keep doing something? How to get out of this? What helped you?  
For example I would really like to do my sport stuff regulary but it only works for few days. And thats just one point on a long list.

At a certain point, everything just feels pointless again and I fall back into my old pattern.";r/depression_help;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1o7m8nv/how_to_get_out_of_depression_even_if_its_a_tiny/
2025-10-15 02:05:13;My psychiatrist wants to remove Wellbutrin even though it's the only thing that has done anything for my depression;"To make it short. I've been on Welbutrin for four years now for my MDD and chronic fatigue, lack of energy and motivation. It's the only antidepressant that has done anything for my depression and that has helped my chronic fatigue, lack of energy and motivation. 

And here comes the problem. I'm just having some side effects with Wellbutrin that I didn't have before and not to this extent either. It gives me physical symptoms of anxiety and causes panic attacks every now and then and I also have pretty bad insomnia from it.

I talked to my new psychiatrist over the phone yesterday and told him about all these side effects. He told me straight out that I should start weaning myself off of it completely. Even though I told him it's the only med that has worked for my depression, chronic fatigue, lack of energy and motivation, he still wouldn't listen to me and just told me, but it sounds bad right now having all these side effects and especially the insomnia. I told him that it does, but the benefits are still outweighing the negatives I get from it. He still wouldn't suggest any other med that can counteract the insomnia and anxiety caused by Wellbutrin. He just wants me to go off of it because of the anxiety and insomnia. He also thinks that it might just be an unnecessary medication that is not really needed for me.

My question now is. Do you think he is right? Do you think that weaning myself off of Wellbutrin is a great idea? I've tried myself stopping Wellbutrin a few times, but it was just for a few days and it was terrible. I could not funtion whatsoever like a normal human being without it. My chronic fatigue, hypersomnia, lack of energy and motivation got instantly worse and my depression and suicidal thoughts started to come back immediately and it almost reached very scary levels. Wellbutrin makes me actually being able to function like a normal human being and it works for my executive dysfunction quite decently. I don't believe it's an unnessary medication. These are just the side effects that have started to come up recently and that have started to bother me. But it hasn't reached the point yet that I want to stop the med completely.

By the way. Melatonin is the only thing right now that makes me able to fall asleep on Wellbutrin. I've been on it for two weeks now and it does help me fall asleep. I just don't want to become dependent on melatonin though just to be able to fall asleep, I want to be able to fall asleep by myself. I'm already trying to taper myself off of melatonin, even though I've only been on it for two weeks. I'm scared that if I use it for too long that my body won't be able to make its own melatonin anymore and that I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without it. I think myself that it's anxiety, overstimulation and just a sense of awakness and alertness overall that makes me not being able fall asleep on Wellbutrin on its own.

When I used to combine Wellbutrin with Prozac almost a year ago, I never had any sleeping issues or insomnia whatsoever and my anxiety levels overall were lower too. So maybe removing the Prozac also has something to do with it. I feel like when I took it with Prozac, that it was somewhat more balanced, but at the same time I did feel a little bit more tired and maybe didn't have as much energy and motivation. But when I took it with Prozac, it never felt edgy too me and I never felt overstimulated either.

And my other question is. Is adding a low dose SSRI or Prozac back, the only way to get rid off the anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia permanently? Because if it's going to be like this all the time, then I might just as well go back to the regimen I had before. I know I will be more tired and I will have less energy and motivation to do things if I add Prozac back, but my sleep and anxiety issues would be a lot better. This is a huge dilemma for to be honest. I still cannot decide what I want to do next.

Also since were already at this topic about executive dysfunction. I have been diagnosed with autism and I have all the signs and symptoms of executive dysfunction and Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that has been able to help me with this. So this is another reason why I don't want to go off of it.";r/depressionregimens;4;35;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1o6my3m/my_psychiatrist_wants_to_remove_wellbutrin_even/
2025-10-13 05:23:29;Frustrated I'm too mild to be helped;"My partner and his family think i have depression, my family have no idea because I will not open up to them and have no desire to do so. I personally don't think I do because I've been the way I am for about 15 years now since my early teens, but I just want to get some insight on this subreddit.

I've always been quiet and introverted, but as a child i was still social and was always with friends and had hobbies. Now as an adult i don't really have much of a personality, don't have any desire to socialise, no friends, no hobbies and very little interests. I have a good sense of humour though and can't say i feel lonely. But this is completely normal to me and I see nothing wrong with this, but im being told these things are a red flag that I have depression???

Apart from being very sensitive to criticism of any form, judgement or thinking I've annoyed someone (these things happen often but by no means everyday) I wouldn't say i feel sad or low mood THAT often?

My life is pretty dull, I work a cleaning job, previously corporate admin but found it too stressful. I have a 2 year old and a partner and as much as I love them I do find myself thinking if only I could have a do over in life. I don't feel like I really enjoy being a mother all that much and I've screamed in my daughters face over small things more times than I can count. 

I get irritated easily but have done for as long as I can remember. I get sensory overwhelm and sometimes I scratch myself intentionally to calm myself but idk why.
The main things I enjoy in life are sleeping, eating, drinking coffee and alcohol. Sometimes I force myself to keep drinking wine to make myself feel like shit on purpose but idk why I do it.

I think I'm on the spectrum but I dont fit enough of the criteria to be referred for a diagnosis. Even if I did have autism I'm pretty sure it would be too mild for anyone to be able to help or care anyway. I feel like that with my ""depression"" if that's what I have... like I'm at a borderline ""mild"" level where it's not really worth seeking any help. 

I've started seeing a counsellor but I already feel she's misunderstanding what im saying, she says what I feel is normal for a parent and is down playing it when I say I scream with rage at my toddler. I'm going to the doctor next week to discuss antidepressants because my partner wants me to but I think they won't have any effect, because like i mentioned above I dont feel sad?

I hope my ramblings make sense and thank you to anyone who can give a bit of insight into what I've written.";r/depression_help;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1o517k1/frustrated_im_too_mild_to_be_helped/

2025-10-12 00:59:17;Psychological vs. Psychiatric Assessment for a formal diagnosis: What's best for me?;"Hi, I'm currently looking to receive a formal diagnosis for OCD, depression, and potentially other mental health conditions, but I’m unsure which route is most appropriate for my situation.

For context: I’m 34 and lived in South America until the age of 29. During that time, I was diagnosed at different points by various professionals with depression, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. Although I engaged in some therapy and took medication briefly, I never fully committed to addressing my mental health.

After moving to Europe 5 years ago, my condition worsened significantly. I’ve had multiple crises, including a period where my life was at risk. This led to a brief stay at a psychiatric hospital, where I was advised to explore the possibility of OCD.

Now, I’m fully committed to taking my mental health seriously, and I recognize that the first step is obtaining a clear, formal diagnosis from a qualified professional so I can begin the appropriate treatment.

At this stage, I’ve contacted both a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist, and here’s what I understand:

* A psychological assessment is more in-depth, typically spread over 8 sessions, and costs around €850 (not covered by my insurance).
* A psychiatric assessment is shorter, usually taking 3–4 sessions, costs approximately €40 in total, and is covered by my insurance.

I’m leaning toward the psychiatric route due to the lower cost and the possibility of quicker access to treatment, including medication if needed. However, I want to ensure I’m not overlooking the benefits of a more comprehensive psychological evaluation.

Given my personal history and current condition, would you say there is a significant advantage to choosing one type of assessment over the other?

2025-10-11 06:27:39;30m I feel like giving up;"Hi, I have never done anything like this but an incident tonight has caused me to crack. 

On paper I’m doing amazing 30 years old, beautiful wife, a very handsome 5 year old son, I own two cars out right now, I’ve bought my dream family home & have an amazing job. So why am I feeling so shit. 

I don’t really know where to begin as I don’t really know when it started to go down hill. I met my wife when I was 21 and she was 18, it started great but then out of the blue she just gave me the cold shoulder whilst giving cryptic messages, after a few nights of tears surrounded by my uni friends I finally got the truth she was at the time pregnant but unfortunately suffered a miscarriage. I fought and fought to earn back her trust that I would have been there for her and a baby if it didn’t go badly like it did. 

Fast forward 4 years and we welcomed our first child it was magical, we were beyond happy. Then all hell broke loose for between 6-9months. The post traumatic stress was really and boy did I feel the brunt. I had played thrown at me I was punch slapped kicked etc all over the list of trivial things. I also cut contact with my parents as they were starting with the same narcissistic tendencies towards my son that I suffered growing up. I have not seen them for the best part of 5 years now. I also did this for my wife as she never saw eye to eye with my parents and thought that cutting them out our lives would make everything better. 

Over time she improved and regained some of the lady I loved. We decided to get married next as we had the house and the car and the child the next on the to do list marriage. All went well in that department and we then were a happily married couple. 

She has always been a furry spirit but I’ve noticed the jabs getting worse the character assassination was becoming all to common. 

Unfortunately we have had 5 miscarriages since getting married. 

She has told me she wants to leave but can’t and then other days she is lovely lovely!!!! 

My son is currently going through the process of getting diagnosed with autism as is struggling in school he is becoming more distant with me. 

I don’t want to discuss everything for the world to read but I’m struggling.

2025-10-11 00:24:57;I’m depressed;So, hello everyone. I've already made a few posts here, but I feel like I need to vent, and I feel like this is a way to do that, so I'm going to do it. So, I lost someone. That person ended the relationship. The relationship lasted five, almost six years, and she ended it because, unfortunately, we had to be apart for the last few years, and she couldn't handle the distance and said she couldn't love me the right way. She ended it in early July, and now it's October, and I'm depressed. I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, so I feel so bad that I can't even explain how I feel because there are so many bad emotions. I've tried to end my life, but it didn't work. However, I increasingly have thoughts of ending it all. What doesn't help is that I'm a lesbian because what I've been feeling is that I wish I had been born a straight woman or a man because it would be everything would be easier and I would fit in better in society and be treated differently, because I also feel that straight men and women have it much easier in everything compared to people with other sexual orientations. I feel that it is very difficult to find someone to share your life with, and even if you do find that person, it is very difficult to find them, and it seems that our world for those who are not straight is very limited. ;r/depressed;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1o35li8/im_depressed/
2025-10-10 12:03:56;grief, cancer, marriage, childhood, life just sucks;"I (currently 21 F) got married at 19, didn't find out until this past year my husband has a porn addiction, kept videos and pictures of his ex's and flings, and as much as I try to watch him and rid of all these things on his electronics, he still does it behind my back. I lost my dad 3 months after my wedding to his alcohol addiction in 2023, the wedding he didn't attend. A year later in 2024 I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and now in 2025 I'm 5 months in remission, but I don't look or feel the same (much more so because my husband lusts after other women, and did so during my most vulnerable time.) And to make matters worse, I found out I was pregnant in September of this year, and my husband expressed he didn't want the baby. I felt the pressure of his wants, our money struggles, and the fact that I'm not emotionally, mentally, or physically healthy enough to raise a baby, and not to mention my marriage isn't perfect. So I followed through with a abortion I now feel endless guilt and I believe I'm feeling regretful. I'm trying to find happiness, I start nursing school in January, I volunteer at a hospital, I'm trying to find work but no one is hiring me.  

Ever since I was little, I felt out of place and like I didn't belong anywhere, coming from an abusive household where both parents were absent, one deep in drinking and pills, and the other drinking, pills and too busy to be there for her kids because she was having an affair. I don't know, life kinda just sucks, and if I wasn't scared of pain, and didn't have this feeling like I might find something to hold on to, I wouldn't be here. I just want to isolate, and be left alone, i don't know where to go or what to do anymore.

2025-10-09 13:33:05;What to do about falling behind in school w/ APs and Honors (helpppp);"I’m a sophmore  with diagnosed major depression and general anxiety and I’ve been falling behind in my classes and we are currently 7ish weeks in school and it has been making me extremely anxious and my suicidal ideations keep coming back.

I moved to a different school this year and i’ve had a horrible time adjusting. every single day has been pretty much the worst.

I’m taking AP lang, AP world, honors algebra II, and honors chem.

Its too late to drop, and honestly I did not want to because I know if I didn’t have such a bad depressive episode I’d be in great shape right now.

I have been kind of half-assing my weekly 40 pages of reading for world and i just know its going to catch up sooner or later. I believe my grades are bad, not because I dont understand or have trouble understanding the material, but because I’ve been so exhausted by just trying to survive that i end up procrastinating or just oversleeping. And ive noticed that in-class work i do good on its just mainly homework. it also doesnt help that i’m in front ensemble (marching band) and the practices take up 6 hours of my week. I feel like if i had one extra day extension i would do exponentially better.

How should I go about this? I know one might say to just drop, but i genuinely dont think i can afford that. 

Is there anyone I can talk about this kind of stuff to? Like is there any specialist that assists you to catch up? 

Do you think I should communicate to my teachers? How would I do this without sounding annoying and off-putting. I’ve heard of many teachers complaining about “mental health” and how “if you cant handle it then level down” and i agree theres some truth to that, but i feel like im in too deep and i feel like i can do it. 

Do you have any tips on catching up? What about for any specific classes? (especially for world)

What are your experiences with talking to ap/honors teachers about mental health?
 What about experiences with 504 plans with ap/honors?? (I had one before, but it was just with honors not aps)

2025-10-07 03:30:56;Talk to someone?;"Hey everyone! Thanks for reading this first of all:). 

So I have been quite depressed(though I think it’s difficult to call it that because I’m not diagnosed) for the last 5 years or so, im 22 now. 

I’ve abused drugs and tried to kill my self once and more stuff im not proud of. And all this without talking to anyone about any of it, like, nothing… And im beginning to notice that it’s getting harder to compose myself. With that I mean I have like 30 minutes of being “happier” and then just a complete feeling of sadness for hours. But that contrast is getting more stark and sudden, sometimes that I can’t hide it, so I am worried.

I don’t want to worry my friends or parents. But I am also thinking that it’s “too late” to talk to a professional. I notice that I can’t really function normally anymore, because I’ll just feel more hopeless when doing anything.  Point is, should I talk to a professional? Or got to groups or something? I have no idea how this works but I feel it starting to get out control after years. Oh yeah and I keep seeing more “things” that aren’t there or aren’t moving more frequently every day. That’s probably related to my drug usage some time ago. (Got a couple of psychosis like experiences but kept going, because, you know, haha) 

I know that im so bad at explaining so im sorry if this doesn’t make sense or the question is just gibberish. But if you read this far I love you. ";r/depression_help;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1nzssnp/talk_to_someone/

2025-10-05 19:24:53;Mind mind is not working to even give a title, sorry.;"
I am 29 male from India. This is really hard, to explain someone what I am feeling like. 
There something running constantly in my head, like I have to really focus hard to feel that I am holding a phone and trying to type. 
I am trying to think but all I hear is the echo in my mind think think think, but it cannot relate to what I need to think about. 
I feel like my brain is hollow. 
I am lonely too. A decade ago, when I used to hear about people with depression being lonely, I used to think how can someone in a world of 7 billion people not find a single person they can talk to? 
Now I am on the other side, lonely, feeling such an outcast. The most frustrating part is I get it, who would wanna be with someone who isn’t even trying. Yeah that’s how it look from the outside, that I am not trying at all. 
I am trying hard to just wake up and live. 

Unemployment also has ruined everything. I regret my decision so much, to leave the job and fix my mental health. I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorder also dysthymia. 

I kept writing and living the script of my comeback in my head, but not even 1% is being converted into effort. 
 
I feel like no point what I am never getting out of this. I am self sabotaging at this stage, like making it so worse that ending myself should be a clear one and only option visible as bright as the sunlight, so I can do it. Why waiting and not doing right now, because I am afraid. I don’t have the guts to do that. 

I have no friends, or you stupid you say, you had them but you pushed them away. 

I also have developed feeling of jealousy I am jealous of watching people live, smile. 

How bad of a sinner I must have been to have such a terrible mind. Yeah, mind I say, life is not terrible,never will  it be. As long as you have functional mind, you can tackle anything.  Yeah, I see this as a luxury now. 

Why am I so afraid, nothing traumatic happened in the past, yes I was raised in poor family but most of the population are. How the hell I got this anxiety, why do I feel so inferior. Why can I feel any emotions. Why. 

I bought 2 book, one called eat the frog to work on procrastination (I procrastination as if I am the champion of it) but that book is lying next to me for 4 days. When I hold that book mind goes like you have a lot more important work to do like prep for interview learn a skill etc but you are holding a book ? I will leave the book but do nothing, just venture into my Maladaptive day dreaming. 

I have found so much comfort in my Mal adaptive day dreaming, that is really hard to comeback to reality. Reality sucks and I can’t do anything about it. 

Wasted another day. 

I can’t even ask for support. I am at a stage where I don’t even have anything to give in return. If I try to get a accountability part what will I be able to do for them ?
If I ask for a friend, again what can I offer them in return? 
Is this how end looks like?
Where you just want to quiet the mind, whatever the way?

2025-10-05 01:45:02;I would rather be dead or homeless than to ever work a job again.;"I think I have finally reached my breaking point, after quitting yet another job yesterday. All my life I imagined that there was some way out of this hellscape some way to finally feel like there is meaning to all this suffering, but the reality is that there is nothing. Nothing in this world is worth going after, it's all meaningless. I have worked various jobs and they all end up the same, or more so, end up making me feel the same. One day I eventually wake up with this overwhelming sense of dread and exhaustion, this feeling of tiredness that just envelops my whole body and keeps me from wanting to get up. Everyone always says to just ignore it. Just get up and it will get better, but it never does. I rise out of bed to feel like shit the whole day, the whole shift, counting down the minutes until I can clock out and return to my cocoon of bedsheets and blankets, only to face that same feeling day in and day out over and over and over and over again.



I don't just have depression, but also struggle with social anxiety and bipolar disorder of which have all been diagnosed when I was institutionalized in a mental hospital as a child/teen a few times. I didn't stay long. I know how to pretend. I know how to make it look like all the gears are turning and everything is all sunshine and rainbows when a simple glance behind that shiny exterior would show the rotting corpse hiding behind. I told myself ""Maybe it's just the long commute, I'll feel better when I get a job closer to home"" Wrong. ""Maybe it's my coworkers, If I get a work from home job I won't constantly feel drained having to talk with them."" Wrong. ""Well, if it's not my coworkers, maybe it's the type of work I do, maybe if I get one that requires less human interaction altogether, it will work out."" WRONG!

  
There is nowhere left to go. This world offers so much, so much extravagance, so much opulence, it's sickening really how much there really is compared to how it ends up being appropriated. It doesn't matter anyway. You wont be able to bring it with you into the next life. Why should I bother putting in so much effort to extend this awful existence when I am promised so much more at the end of this? No. I give up. I am not made for this society and am tired trying to shove my circle figure into the square hole of whatever the hell is expected of citizens today.



 No I am not suicidal and I urge that even if you feel the same as I do that you don't make any rash decisions. I know how it can feel reading something that resonates with your being and drives you to do certain things. Please don't.

2025-10-04 23:13:46;Issues with eating, not sure if anyone has experienced this and maybe has a solution;Hi friends! Over the past month or two I have been struggling to eat by having no appetite even when I have hunger pains which turns into nausea which makes me want to eat even less. I do not have a diagnosed eating disorder and I really don’t have body image issues that would make me restrict/be anxious about food which is why I’m a bit more confused about not being able to eat much. Even when I try to order food I really like as an incentive to finish the whole meal I tend to only be able to eat 1/8-1/3 of my food. I have been drinking carnation instant breakfasts with milk in the morning to make sure I get some fats/protein/other vitamins but eating solid foods or being interested in eating is still very difficult.

2025-10-04 08:37:54;It might sound silly, but I’ve been thinking about giving up on everything just because I’m fat (vent);"This isn’t clickbait. It’s a vent.

I was born without a father. From an early age I had to fend for myself and deal with bullying, aggression, humiliation and nicknames because of my body.

In 2019, after years of being the punchline, I finally fought back: I started training Muay Thai, running seriously, and I hit the weight goal I’d always dreamed of. It was the best moment of my life.

Then the pandemic came and everything fell apart. I was diagnosed with a pseudotumor, I started getting sick whenever I exercised, and everything I’d built just crumbled. I gained weight back, lost motivation, lost my health.

As if that wasn’t enough, my ex, the one I helped, teaching her about diet, macros and weight loss when she didn’t even know where to start, had been cheating on me since 2021 without me knowing. When she ended things, she even had the nerve to say the other guy was “way better than me” and started liking and reposting videos like “thanks for leaving me in the ocean, you don’t know the tasty shark I found there,” as if it had been my choice or as if I were just dead weight in her life.

She never felt sorry for me, she mocks me even more now and she’s doing better than me, already with someone else. I, who gave so much of myself, ended up here alone, with my health and self-esteem falling apart.

I know I’m nothing and sometimes I think that’s what I deserve. But the truth is I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to think about calorie deficits, I don’t want to think about problems, or women. I just want to stop feeling all of this.";r/depressed;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1nxg1je/it_might_sound_silly_but_ive_been_thinking_about/
2025-10-03 09:56:46;Depression with an episodic nature, meltdowns, or more?;"Hey all

I wanted to ask to see if anyone else has these 

Basically Ive always had issues with depression and anxiety diagnosed in my teens, but a lot of the times my depression comes in episodes. 

I don't have any mania or episodic highs I'm just doing okay and one (normally) small thing will happen and I'll have an episode, crying wanting to sh, inconsolable, pure rage against myself, self hatred, not really being able to explain why I'm so upset. Normally it happens in the evenings so I've always put them down to being craggy and tired. They last for a few hours, once I calm down I feel really ashamed and apologise for those involved, I feel stupid and have made a big deal out of small things sometimes losing friends and saying stuff in the wrong way. One huge trigger for this is the feeling of blame towards me in any sense, immediately going into 'it's all my fault' vibes or 'no one will ever love me' and lots of 'I'm so sorry'. 

Part of me is terrified that it could be bipolar but since I've never really had a manic episode or switches other then the depression I don't think this is what it is. A part of me thinks that I'm actually having autistic meltdowns, I'm not diagnosed but have a lot of traits, I'm high masking anyway with my depression and other conditions, so I'm not sure. Normally reducing the sensory input can really help, often running my hands under the cold tap till they go a little tingly pulls me out of a SH thought chain and grounds me. 

As far as I can remember I've had these, being overly sensitive as a kid and labeled the cry baby, having tantrums about random shit like being given the apple juice I asked for when I actually wanted cola as a kid, as a teen it was anger so bad I'd scribble through several pages of my note pads. I've tried a lot of SSRI's and I'm currently on 40mg paroxetine and his helps for the generic depression but when I have these episodes it's like my brain thinks it's the end of the world and it can be really hard to be pulled out from.

2025-10-03 01:53:15;How do I know if it is my environment/circumstances or something more?;"40s man. I believe I have been in a low-level depressive state generally my entire life. As I've gotten older it has become harder to deeply feel positive emotions. The best I can describe it is that it doesn't surpass 'pleased satisfaction' very often. On the other end of the spectrum I can drop into a heavier depressive state for extended periods of time. Sometimes it is triggered by circumstance, but sometimes it feels like it comes out of nowhere.

That being said, I blame some of the lack of strong positive feeling on my ability & historic tendency to disociate/detach myself from emotion. It was a survival skill that I had to learn in childhood and was reinforced over time. The pandemic directly/indirectly bascially destroyed a lot of things I had going on in my life. Lockdown instigated/accelerated the breakdown of a 4-year relationship, my stepfather died indirectly due to COVID (mis-diagnosis + inability to catch it because doctors busy), and my little sister had a mental breakdown in part instigated by an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine (I had one as well). It triggered me having to move across the country, blow up my entire 20 life in a different city on the opposite coast, move her out of her apartment and care for her(my mom was overwhelmed with my stepdad's illness) for a year. It has been difficult dealing with the loss of my irl social circle to say the least.

Continuing, it has started to become more dramatic and last longer. It can get to light ideation, though I've never acted on it or thought of acting on it.

I have always been concerned with the side-effects and effecacy of anti-depressent medications. I value control of myself and my life pretty highly, and I don't want something to upset that. I can never be sure if what I'm experiencing is a chemical imbalance that needs addressing or if it is my brain expressing its distaste of our current circumstances and pushing for a change.

How can I be sure?

I have to pep talk myself to show up everyday to work and just be present. I feel like I’m drowning. An unmotivated, sad, lethargic zombie. Im scared of how bad my laziness will get for me. All the things I used to enjoy I just don’t care to do. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Find a solution? ";r/depressed;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1nvxtkl/i_dont_know_what_to_do/
2025-10-02 01:48:30;I need some help here with focusing, not sure if it is mental health related or not;So, like I stated, I'm not quite sure if this is a mental health thing or not, but it probably is. I'm home schooled, which I know sounds terrifying, but my dad's a college professor with over 20 years of teaching under his belt, so I'm in good hands. Anyways, my point is that homeschooling has helped me with pretty much everything, except for focus. Yet again, I could be wrong about it being rooted in mental health, but I have diagnosed depression, so I figured this could be a contributor. Every time I sit down to do my work, I either get really distracted, don't want to do it, or cry. Like deadass, I cry. I wish I knew what caused this, but I have no clue. If it helps you guys maybe *try* to figure it out, I'm on wellbutrin (I believe that's how it's spelled) as of the moment, and I haven't experienced any side effects, but maybe this is.

2025-09-30 23:06:32;Depression disguised as Insomnia;"My friend is a practical and hyper-independent person. She’s had a rough childhood but has made great attempts to heal. One thing that always stood out about her was that she had answers or temporary solutions for anything and everything in life. It was impressive, yet a bit bizarre to me.
Recently, she was diagnosed with depression, which was surprising for both of us. For the past few months, she has been struggling to sleep. Eventually, she connected the dots and realized that she talks to herself a lot. She thinks about everything and has long conversations with herself. It never really bothered her until it started affecting her sleep, where she would do it all night in her mind.

2025-09-29 16:50:14;Can Buspirone cause intense PMS mood swings while being greatly effective for residual anxiety during normal time?;"I have a friend who is on Sertraline 200, Desvenlafaxine 50 for intial diagnosis of GAD. Now the diagnosis has been upgraded to MDD. She tried vilazodone, bupropion with no effect. Sertraline was started at first during GAD diagnosis. It obliterated the panic attacks.

But still there was residual anxiety. So doc added Buspirone TID 5mg the first month and then 10mg TID the next month. During the first month there was only slight irritability and social isolation tendencies during the premenstrual week. But, since the dose increase she has had severe mood fluctuations for 5 days before her periods started. She had uncontrollable anger, which she was aware of, but, was unable to control. It caused significant distress to her particularly she was actively aware when the mood swings were happening and not after a day or two of any incident. But the bright side is that Buspirone worked tremendously well for the residual anxiety.

So, is this a thing with Buspirone? The doc has asked to come after two months. Should she wait for another menstrual cycle to see if it is just an adjustment period with dose increase? She is confused because on one hand it is helping much with anxiety while on the other it is devastating.

Can Buspirone worsen depression or is this the drug combo that is causing the issues?";r/depressionregimens;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1ntcxbq/can_buspirone_cause_intense_pms_mood_swings_while/

I am a 25 year old man. I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression, and social pragmatic disorder in college.

We both loved each other deeply but I realized that I hated myself and didn't want to put that on her (my dad abused me growing up because he hated himself so I didn't want to be like him). Recently I have been having a ton of trouble with irrational thinking, overthinking, and being depressed. Today I had a anxiety attack because my friends/coworkers went to lunch without me - and that got me really upset not because they went to lunch but because in college I had roommates that constantly talked crap about me and went out of their way to not invite me to stuff and I was the most alone I have ever been and even suicidal. I feel so alone rn even with friends that actually care about me. I hate that I am like this - I just want to be normal. I want to not burden my friends and family with my poor mental health when they have to deal with their own stuff. I want to be in a relationship where I don't rely on her to fix my mental health. I just want to be okay. But I feel so alone and tired. I am tired of trying for more than 10 years to be normal. It;s not working. I have done years upon years of talk therapy.

For example, a bunch of times that I go drinking with my friends I get overwhelmed and go outside and stay out there for the rest of the night. I just want to be better. I want to not be always ashamed of how I act and how I feel. Can't I just be normal??? I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to be clear I am not suicidal. I just want new ways to get better because what im doing isnt working.

So. That's the bad. Here's the good. My family and friends are awesome and they have given me loads of advice. They think that going to group therapy/behavioral therapy will help more than talk therapy for all my social stuff.

They say to think the best in people and not instantly think that people are are trying to avoid me/get me.

2025-09-28 04:23:29;How do i tell my loved ones that i want to die?;"Hello, I was diagnosed with problems such as severe depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and a lot more since i was in high school. Because of my mental and physical problems, I was unable to go into college, and struggled to maintain any jobs.

Now at 21, after years of struggling, i feel like I've became a burden and a source of problems to people around me. I tried therapy, medication, talking to friends, but nothing worked. I feel hopeless and there's nothing i could do to change my life, i feel like i don't deserve anything, and the longer i life, the worse it would get for me and people around me, I'm very tired of living. i'm planning to gather some money for a few months, and commit suicide, this time for real. 

So how do i tell my loved ones(family and few friends) that i want to die? Especially my mother, I don't want to drag her down with me, I don't want to shock or hurt her.

2025-09-25 11:46:53;Would rather be dead than blind;"I've always struggled with anxiety and depression, but ever since I was diagnosed with a rare genetic eye disease and put on steroids it's been out of control. For a while I found the strength to hang in there because everyone thought the treatments might work. Now that the treatments have failed I've lost hope. This isn't a condition that can improve or spontaneously go into remission. It just progresses until you're blind. I'm only 39, so losing my vision in the next couple of years is going to mean living out the second half of my life as a blind person, which I simply cannot imagine doing. 

Not only is that existentially terrifying, it will rob me of my occupation, hobbies, and independence. I would honestly prefer to be dead and have already written a will. 

I'm not sure why I posted this tbh. I guess it's good to get things off my chest. There isn't anyone in my life I can speak to about this because nobody understands or even cares all that much. I've been very candid with my doctors about suicidal ideation, but they brushed it off because they hear all the time and are very hardened to the suffering of others.

2025-09-24 22:46:25;How can I show my depressed friend that I care?;"My friend has been diagnosed with severe depression and last week was taken to a mental hospital due to suicidal thoughts. I’ve been friends with her for a few years now and have always known she struggles with these things. I care about her a lot and really like having her as a friend. She knows that and most likely thinks the same about me. 

Since she was taken to the mental hospital, she has posted many snapchat stories and a few tiktoks talking about deep stuff. It always makes me more and more worried about her but also helps me understand her situation. One time she said something like ”Since I got here, I’ve realized who of my friends truly care about me” meaning some of her so-called friends stop contacting her when they realize her situation. 

So to get to my actual question. How can I show my kindness to this friend and make her feel cared. I want to show her that I care and will always be there for her. I’m worried that someday she wont be here anymore and want to do something to prevent that. She is getting help now at the hospital and I want to make her feel even a bit better. And I’m aware you can’t completely cheer up a depressed person. However you can make her feel loved. 

I really would like to give her a card, but what to write in it? What else could I do? Please give some advice🙏❤️💞 It would help if I could meet her now and talk to her, but since she is at the hospital, I can rarely see her in person.

I have anhedonia, so I don’t feel any joy/happiness doing any of my hobbies anymore.
I have a case open with Community Mental Health Team in England.

I’ve been referred to Psychology and I’m awaiting an appointment, because I’m showing traits/symptoms of a MH disorder that isn’t yet diagnosed.
I’ve also been referred for therapy.
I was referred to Psychiatry and I had the appointment, she’s put me on a different, newer type anti depressant as I’ve tried all the rest over the years.

Unfortunately psychology and therapy will likely take months before I see/have an appointment for either of them.

I was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD last year, unfortunately the meds didn’t help my mental health, it just helped with less impulsivity and procrastination.

I feel lost and so hopeless, like I don’t know who I am.
I have a couple of irl friends but no one I’m really close to.
I know I’ve been avoiding going outside, seeing anyone, responding to peoples messages on my phone.
I know it’s likely unhealthy coping mechanism to stay indoors and not speak to anyone, but I just can’t do it.

When I see people, I still have all these horrid thoughts and feel so depressed and alone, that all I want is to be at home, then when I finally get home I just break down crying.

I feel so alone, so lost, so hopeless.
I don’t know what to do anymore.

Honestly I don’t want to be alive.. but I can’t end things because I don’t wish for anyone, my mum, my family and friends, people I know, to feel grief or the pain I feel.
I wouldn’t wish this emptiness and pain on anybody.
So I have to stay alive because I cannot be the cause of pain and heartache.

2025-09-21 13:06:07;I REALLY want to kill myself, but I need someone to talk me out of it, please.;"Hi.I'll be quick and try not to bore you.

**I am a 23 year old, male**.About 1 year ago, my **mom got diagnosed with cancer.** This was always my biggest fear, **my worst nightmare,** and suddenly, I was living it.

**I am** and always was **best friends with my mom (ever since I was a kid).** I love her with all of my heart and have never loved anyone else. **No, I'm not a sicko with oedipus complex.**

My **sisters are terrible people**, always on drugs or doing some other dumb shit even though my mom always supported and tried her best to handle them. I don't like my sisters. I also don't hate them, but they are not the kind of people I'd want near me.

It's been a very tough year. **I am jobless(as I've always been), I only have one friend,** and while I am not necessarily ugly or an asshole, I've just never met any girl I'd want to build a life with, so I'm single mostly because of that (and the fact that **I've shut myself way more after my mom's diagnosis).**

Some short time from now, **she will be undergoing surgery and will have her cancer removed**. These last few weeks of expectation have been pure torture. She's been eating fine, sleeping a lot (but fine) and **occasionally she gets a little confused here and there** \- and while she was checked several times for brain damage or whatever mental problem it could be, **I still get extremely depressed seeing her like that,** I don't think I'd be able to handle for 1 single day seeing my mom with alzheimer or something.

**Doctors are positive,** but this last week she received another diagnosis of a possible cancer expansion being noted. They are not sure, and it might be just some hemorroids, but still, that really made us scared.

**As pathetic as that sounds for a 23 year old male, I... can't imagine living without her.** I don't have a family, and my one friend, while we go way back, wouldn't be enough help or ""motivation"" to keep me going. **I would be ENTIRELY alone.**

I've had my fair share of teenage drama suicide thoughts (like being depressed cause a girl I liked was dating another guy kind of thing) but for the first time in my life, I know what TRUE sadness feels like.

**I'm with a constant pain in my chest, and I honestly, seriously, DEEPLY, want to kill myself if my mom does not recover.**

**I was going to move to Japan** next year to study abroad (with other language exchange students) and start building my life, but **I don't even feel like doing that anymore.**

I've always been a positive person, **the Forrest Gump kind of positive person,** but I don't know if I can get out of this one.

Please don't tell me to go to therapy. While I do agree that would be helpful, I am not ready to face these feelings truthfully, just writing this post is making me cry. I also don't want my mom to be worried.

**Please, please, I need to know about someone that has been in a similar situation and came out well. I need some hope. I am tired, I am depressed, I feel like I grew 40 years older in this last year.**

One last thing I think might be interesting to note is that I am not stupid. Please, I don't want to sound rude, that is really not my intention. What I mean, is that I am generally a fast learner, I study a lot (programming for games, 3D software, language learning) and I also have a very decent amount of money stored up. I'm saying that, cause while I do live with my mom at 23, I don't want to give the impression that I stay at home playing games all day, I am also NOT saying this to brag about it, I just think these are very different cases to mine.

I appreciate if you read all of this. Really do.

2025-09-17 05:20:54;Former athlete depressed after life changing injuries;"""former athlete""

Just those words. I have finally typed them. 

I am a 38 yo man. As a kid I was scrawny and bullied both at school and at home. I was always the smallest wherever I go. Didn't help that I skipped a grade. 

I started to do a lot of sports. Athletics but especially martial arts - judo, taekwondo - which bring me confidence and self-fulfillment 

At 27 I was suddenly diagnosed with a condition called myathenia gravis. Basically your body attacks the receptors of your nervous signal to make it short. 

I had surgery (thimectomy) and spent a lot of time in the hospital and then found a treatment that allowed me to live with the sickness. 

At 31 I started sports again. I did CrossFit like training, kettlbells, lifted heavy, running, biking. And on top of that I came back to martial arts and started BJJ and boxing. I had two boxing ""smokers"" (it means when boxing gyms gather and have unofficial tournaments to get their fighters some more intense practice). My kids came and saw my fights. I was so proud.

On 2024 I was scheduled to participate in an Hyrox race, and that year I did a 3 days hike in Sancy mountains in France.

Everyone was complimenting me on how fit and strong I looked. 

I was planning to shift career and get back to school to become a personally trainer. I had my seat reserved in a two years training formation to get my certificate. I wanted to open a YouTube channel about fitness and sports and bought all the set-up, camera, microphone, lights, everything. 

Then in July 2024 I got a hip injury caused by myself. In August 2024 I injured my sternum with weighted dips. In October 2024 I was hit by a small truck when I was on my bicycle and it messed up my knee. In march 2024 I pulled my middle and lower trapezius doing pull-ups. In April 2024 I had an work accident and cut my wrist with glass sectioning a tendon that was luckily reattached by the surgeon in emergen surgery.

Today September 2025 I have not healed. My hip has bursitis, femoro acetabular impingement and psoas problems. My knee has a deep focal cartilage fissure and pes anserine tendinopathy. My sternum has costochondroitis and arthropathy. My back has a trapezius strain that does want to heal.

I. Can't. Train. Anything. I'm back to be my good ol' weak sickly pathetic self. I am so sad. I used to take my kids with me to the street park and teach them push-ups and squats and pull ups. They were so proud to tell everyone their dad is so strong and active. I used to put them on my back when doing pushups. 

Sports was everything to me. My identity. I even organized Street lifting competitions in my town and people keep asking me to do it again. I had a knack for it.

My wife doesn't understand how sad I am or even why I'm so sad. She tells me she can't help. I'm not blaming her. 

I did everything went to every sports doctor and every surgeon had injections done to my knee three times, did a 100 sessions of physical therapy, had dry needling, cupping therapy, and I'm still taking NSAIDS and paracetamol and painkillers to sleep. The pain is so intense that I can't sleep it wakes me up.

God my life is so pathetic now. I tried everything to work around my injuries. I decided to go on walks at least 10,000 steps a day since I can't work out anymore but after a few days my knee hurts too much for that yio. I think this is it. I'm done. I'm heartbroken. I don't have any solution. I don't have the strength to fight anymore

2025-09-16 20:18:01;Does it get better?;I’m 33f. I was diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 13 after my parents found my suicide note. I was put in therapy and on medications. It didn’t get better. I zombied through life. I zombied through relationships. I would feel intense emotions deeply and then numb. Alternative healing and spirituality helped. I changed. I felt happy for the first time. Life got shit again. I spiralled. I’m here now 3-4 years later still in that spiral unable to help myself. Unable to do anything. Back in therapy which is not helping. Consumed by thoughts of ending it all and not getting the courage to do so. I dunno what I’m looking for in this post. If someone can share their success stories, I would love to read them. I have no career, a bad marriage and nothing to look forward to. I don’t see this getting better.;r/depressed;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1nifuev/does_it_get_better/
2025-09-16 00:48:34;Served with Divorce papers on Friday, feel like my life is crumbling around me;"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my adult life due to a cPTSD event at the end of college.  I have been diagnosed with abandonment issues, self-esteem issues, ADHD and extreme social anxiety disorder (being evaluated for bi-polar disorder as well).  I'm currently taking Zoloft (200mg), Wellbutrin (300mg) and Abilify (4mg) daily as well as Lorazepam (1-2mg) on an as-needed basis.  Additionally, I am on 10mg of Adderall twice a day, though many days I double up in the morning.  Yet, since getting served with papers on Friday (and honestly before that, since my separation in December), I have been on an increasingly dangerous downward spiral.  

I don't feel like the current meds that I am taking are helping anymore and wanted to look into other options/suggestions before meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow.  The divorce I can deal with, but the prospect of ruining my children's lives is killing me.  This whole situation is also having an adverse impact on my professional life as well as my focus and attention is being pulled in multiple directions.  Have people found other medications the be more successful?  

I wish I could say that I was doing other things in my life to help with depression but I'm already working between 70-80 hours a week across 3 jobs just to keep my head afloat.  I spend as much time with my kids as I possibly can but my 15 year old son barely wants to talk to me and my 10 year old daughter would prefer to stay at her mother's house overnight.  I have no real friends I feel like I can talk to about all of this outside of two who truly know what is going on, so I'm resorting to turning to Reddit to hopefully find some answers.

2025-09-15 20:26:50;What do I do at this position?;"So I am diagnosed with schizoaffective officially. I take bupropion 300 mg SR and MPH 20 mg OD because they give me enough energy such that I can perform my job. 

As of late I began taking the mood stabilizer Topiramate. Night before last night I increased the dosage from 50 mg to 100 mg. Yesterday and this morning, I found that the MPH hit me very hard. It was like the Topiramate amplified the MPH. I know this is random and doesn't make sense. I was expecting the opposite. But this is what happened. 

I don't really know what to do. It seems like I would have to lower the dose of MPH.

2025-09-15 16:48:06;Does anyone else get this?;"
I basically get this partixular mood swing where I get fucking angry, melancholic, apathetic.

Its like a light switch: I get angry at a nuance or something that just is off even a bit. Then I think “fuck this” and just want to leave. I hate things, I hate what I liked, I hate people. 

The anger is never shown. What is shown to others is my reclusiveness and reticence. I know the affects of shouting or getting angry at another and don’t care for doing it. Instead anger brew within me. I get tense, and I want to leave wherever I’m at. 

But under that anger is melancholy. My throat tightens from holding tears. If someone were to try and hug me or understand my feelings, the dam would likely fall. 

Then theres the apathy. Fuck this, fuck that, I hate this. Followed closely by death. Not suicide, but death. Death feels safe and secure. Endless black and sleep (I’m atheist). It soothes me. I want to die from something sudden and unexpected. 

A recent example of this occuring was just a few weeks ago. I have insomnia so I was tired for my new job, I’m 18, and was almost ready when I was late. I say on my bed… and stared at nothing. All that had happened was that I was a little late, yet the switch flicked. I ended up texting my boss thhat I wasnt coming. They said its a no call no show and very bad. I said sure, and asked if I was losing hours. No response. Almost quit but my mother said not to. I apologized to my boss a few days later.

I was diagnosed in my senior year in febuary of this year. Been on wellbutrin, but stopped for a couple weeks, now am inconsistent. But I almost don’t want the pills because this feeling gives me certainty. Like I know what I want. Everything, though painful and worthless I’m the moment to me, becomes clearer.

2025-09-15 06:13:35;I feel so alone;"Lately I (21M) have been dealing with some really strong emotions, but I don't really know what they are. It feels like a kind of extreme anxiety that everyone I care about is slowly cutting me off from their lives one by one, but rationally I know that's not the case.

I put a lot of effort into maintaining the few relationships I have, mainly because I find it really hard to form relationships, like it takes far too much for me to make new friends, or expose myself to new people, and I have relatively fewer family members than most, but they aren't really the best option for reaching out for comfort, which is why I try my absolute best to maintain the relationships I do have.

But recently, out of literally nowhere, I've been subconsciously withdrawing myself a little from my world, mainly to focus more on uni and work, and as a result, I've noticed a sizeable decline in the quality of conversation and personal time that I do spend with those I consider important to me.

For instance, my mother, whom I've been extremely close to for years since my father and grandmother's death, has recently seemed like a passing ghost in our house. She's always been a workaholic, but she'd always have time for me and/or my siblings and lately, that hasn't been the case, we rarely even greet each other in passing now, and it kills me whenever I do see her because I want to talk to her about this feeling (I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and she helped me through it greatly) and I see the tired look in her eyes and I just know that my feelings and emotions would take a back seat to whatever stressful event took place at work.

My two best friends have been doing much more together, which in itself I have no issue with, but I feel like a third wheel that invited himself to gatherings/outings we've planned. I feel like a backup best friend, and normally I wouldn't have an issue with that since I had no friends growing up and I personally found comfort in even being a backup friend, but when I see people I've grown close to ignoring me when we've agreed to hang out together, it hurts.

And it hurts worse because I've been vulnerable and open with both of them, and now that we're seemingly more distant, I think back to other people I've tried talking to for help and accidentally- for lack of a better term- info-dumped on them, and they labelled me a burden and left. I'm scared of ending up alone again because I've tried to handle my issues on my own before, and it was horrible. I'm not best equipped to handle extreme feelings, hell I'm not even able to handle my normal emotions, and I just feel awful and scared and alone and useless.

And the worst part is that I know these feelings are irrational, I know that they're all in my head, but there's no more comfort in that knowledge for me. 

I'm just really alone right now, and I hope these feelings pass soon. I really can't stand them

2025-09-14 04:56:08;Trying to rebuild my life at 32 after depression and setbacks;"I’m a 32M from Mumbai, India.

I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and—according to my psychiatrist—possibly on the spectrum of schizophrenia.

My childhood was chaotic. My father passed away when I was 11. My paternal aunt had schizophrenia and would often become violent—abusing my grandparents, trying to drag my mother out of the house, running away for days, or roaming around half-dressed. All of this left a deep mark on me. (Thankfully, she is stable now, and she is also very loving.)

My elder sister handled things better, but I couldn’t. On the outside, I looked calm—I did well in exams and rarely spoke in class. Inside, I was always terrified. Teachers and classmates had no idea about my family background.

I got into a good engineering college in Mumbai, but college life completely overwhelmed me. I once fainted in class when a professor asked me a question. I never joined activities, even though I wanted to. I had a few friends, but my grades dropped. My marksheet doesn’t reflect the potential I had.

Over time, things worsened. At one point, I attempted suicide twice. At 30, I also started verbally abusing my mother and sister. That finally scared me into consulting a new psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and schizophrenia spectrum. His treatment has helped me a lot. For the first time in my life, I feel emotionally stable.

My mother and sister are very supportive. My aunt is also kind. But instead of me taking care of them in their old age, they are still taking care of me. That thought weighs on me heavily.

I don’t have any school friends now—they think I wasted my life. The few friends I have are from college, but they don’t know about my past.

One thing that still surprises me: even after all these years, I can clearly recall physics and maths concepts. They’ve stayed with me.

I don’t want to use my childhood as an excuse for my failures — but I also don’t want it to keep holding me back.

I’ve been thinking of starting something new—like teaching Physics and Math to MHT-CET aspirants. It excites me, but then I fear people will judge me and say, “He started teaching because he couldn’t do anything else.”

I’m trying to move forward, but I keep regretting my past and comparing myself with others. How do I stop living in regret and finally believe that I can still build something meaningful at 32?";r/depression_help;8;4;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1ng8jfh/trying_to_rebuild_my_life_at_32_after_depression/

2025-09-12 01:59:13;Need a way to keep focused and motivated;"Hello everyone. First time posting here. Let me provide bullet points of my situation:

* 32, F, diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder/ Treatment Resistant Depression/ Generalized Anxiety Disorder/Agoraphobia
* Currently back in school to study sonography (only taking two classes at the moment as I don't think I can handle much more given my condition)
* Recently out of Intensive Inpatient since early July (my stay was 20 days with regular group, medication management, and ECT treatment though I only received 4 treatments out of the 10-12 I was considered for.)
* Currently in an IOP group as my post treatment to being hospitalized which is 3 days a week. 
* I receive individual therapy and working to find a new provider for medication management. 
* Only med I'm currently taking is Zoloft 200mg which is the highest dose. I think I need a different med as I see no real results with this med I have been taking for more than a year. I have taken many meds throughout the years and it has been difficult to find something that works long term.
* I have tried TMS, Ketamine Treatment (oral tablet), and recently ECT treatment which I want to go back to finishing.
* Recently got a job offer to work in an office which I am happy to receive but also very anxious about.

While the last few bullet points are a positive, I feel anything but. The day previous, I was paralyzed by my anxiety and stress of classes/potential job that I just stayed in bed all day. My sleep patterns are out of wack because of said being in bed frequently and I am trying to push through it all. I'm trying my best to go outside every day to get sunlight and exposure therapy for my agoraphobia.  Any supplements, treatments, and other ideas are welcome but please be consctructive. I'm really trying not to let my depression beat me this time around but it has been challenging. I hope any insight would prove useful whether it be alternative treatments, supplements, or other talk/group therapies.

However, I noticed that I have been eating significantly less than I would normally eat. I find it a chore or a hassle to make meals for myself. Just the idea of having to make time to put food together or sit down and eat is too much for me to deal with. I never been personally diagnosed with an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa. But I feel like maybe it could derive from feeling depressed lowkey? I'm not sure.

Does anyone relate to this or know how to go about it? I know typically others would eat more when they are depressed but it's the opposite for me.

2025-09-08 06:59:36;treatment resistance help;"TW: SH/SI 
For context, I (22F American) was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder at age 14 but suffered for years prior to diagnosis following a traumatic time at age 9/10. I have no relevant medical conditions. I have experienced trauma as a child and adult but I don’t have PTSD. After trying several medications that didn’t help at all, I was eventually labeled as treatment resistant. In 2024, after an inpatient stay, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I hesitate to fully identify with it, as I’m a young woman and I see so many young women diagnosed lately. While I do admit I have several symptoms of BPD (self harm/suicidality, unstable relationships/self image, inappropriate anger, feelings of emptiness, paranoia, ect.), they are not as constantly pervasive to my life as my depression and anxiety symptoms are. They tend to appear/get worse during the fall/winter months whereas my depression and especially my social anxiety seem to be more constant. I have tried the following medications: Lexapro, Concerta, Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Abilify, Lamictal, Amitriptyline, Zoloft, Rexulti, Hydroxyzine, Propranolol, Trintellix, and Buspirone. I have gotten genetic testing done. I have also tried IV Ketamine therapy (was helpful at first but had to stop due to $$$), and am currently on an every other week Spravato regimen that I also thought was helpful at first, but I’m at a point where I haven’t seen any improvement lately. I have seen countless therapists (talk therapy, CBT, DBT, EMDR) and psychiatrists with little relief from my symptoms.
I’m good with taking my medications and I never miss appointments. My symptoms almost always improve (sometimes slightly, sometimes significantly) in the spring/summer and increase in severity in the fall/winter months, but never full relief. So as fall approaches, I’m making this post to see if there are more options. I know I need to make lifestyle changes, increase exercise, improve diet, get out and be more social, but I just don’t have the tools to be consistent with these things. I have heard of TMS and been told I’m a good candidate for it, but I’m going to college in a smaller town that doesn’t have a clinic nearby, so it will be difficult for me to do that treatment at this time. If it really is worth it, I could probably make it work, but I hear that it doesn’t always last for people. I’ve heard of ECT but am very wary about it. Is there a point where medication is not worth the trouble? Every time I “fail” a new medication, my hopelessness increases. I have brought this up to providers and am shut down every time, being told I just need to keep trying and eventually I’ll find the right combination and to “not give up.” Are they right or do they just want me to keep taking pills since that is the recommended course of treatment? Is there a “right” combination out there for everyone or are some people just not ever going to improve with pills? Could medications possibly be making my symptoms worse? I’m currently on a combination of Trintellix and Buspirone and have been on them for over a year. I do not feel like they are doing anything for me, I just take them so I don’t get called non compliant. 
Are there any unconventional treatments that I’m not aware of that any of you have had success with? I don’t want to live the rest of my life this way or eventually kill myself. The past few years, each year has been getting worse. My only suicide attempt was earlier this year. I’m not actively suicidal at this time, but I deal with intrusive thoughts, sometimes multiple times a day, that tell me to kill myself or that I deserve to die. I’m tired of hearing “see you next week/month,” “keep trying,” and “give it time.” This has been my reality for over half of my life and I don't want a future if this is going to be it forever. Thank you if you read this far and I’m sorry if some of it seemed rambly. I’m happy to answer any questions. I just need some advice and hope.

2025-09-06 07:44:02;Can't afford therapy. Now what;"Second try because I could swear I made a post here, but then it disappeared without a trace. Keeping it shorter this time. I'm an engineer and there's nothing better in the market, so my salary won't get better any time soon. I basically live paycheck to paycheck, salaries suck in Colombia, and is virtually impossible to immigrate legally elsewhere (moreso when precisely, you're low on money). I work 44 hours a week and live on my own, doing the house chores takes most of the little free time and energy I have left. Without extra time or money, having a pet wouldn't be doable. I have no support network. I don't have a bad relationship with my family, but not good either, definitely don't trust them to tell them about my personal problems. I have a couple friends, but they live out of town and I only see them a couple times a year, also not exactly the type I'd like to open up to. Only friend I trust enough lives in the Baltics, and between timezone differences and she having her own issues and lack of free time, I'm overwhelming her with my problems.

Supposedly my medical insurance provides psychology treatment, but it is universally regarded as useless by locals (have experienced this myself). 20 minute appointments each three weeks at best, doctors don't really seem to care. I tried a few times and ended up getting a variation of ""you don't have anything that requires a diagnosis, just be more normal, go out and have fun"".

I've been in a declining mood since I finished high school 20 years ago, but I feel the last two years is worsening at an increasing rate. Starting to wonder about the point of living. I feel like I just live to pay debts and not break my mom's heart. Enjoying life requires a minimum of time and money I simply don't have, and neither do I have any realistic hope of things improving. Last month is starting to get harder to stay focused at work, and I may be losing that last trait of being a functional adult.

Feel hopeless and worsening, but don't have social life, can't have a pet, will never have my own place, will never have a partner, no time or money for ways to cope, and definitely not for private therapy.

She cheated after being together for 5yrs and knowing her since we were in nappies and kindergarten, through to primary and high school (asked her out in high school). After she cheated, to keep it short and concise, I went through everything under the sun. From attempts, to substances and now I’m in today (3/9/25) not happy, but not doing idiotic things, I guess? I’m so lost and everyday is becoming so heavy again and I’m just genuinely scared. Don’t get me wrong, I’m in a better place mentally and strong enough to admit, she doesn’t control my whole life anymore. But, there’s not been a single day and night after she left me on the day after she finished work and came over sporadically the day after my 20th, which nothing indicated or at least I was oblivious to the signs of separation, where I thought I’d lose her. I’ve done the stupid “usual” I guess, drunk text, drunk call and around start of this year was blocked on everything. I found out she got with a guy from uni I don’t know when, but she did. I’m just trying to not fall into that abyss again but I feel like I am man. The nightmares every single night are making me wake up again in tears and I’m barely sleeping again. For context, I work for a non-for-profit marketing agency where I can’t be in a bad place or at least, not show it. It’s getting hard to not do that anymore though. I’m scared, since she left I’ve been diagnosed, with constant therapy, with BPD, and I’ve regrettably slept with a few girls after her (only as of this year) when she was my first and only. I feel like a slob for it, I feel so gross and just hating myself everyday but it’s getting 10x worse. I’m scared I’m gonna lose everything again, I don’t want to go to hospitals or psych-wards again. I just need help please. I love her, I miss her. I’ve never stopped. But I can’t let my life fall apart again. Mums on end of life support currently and after she’s gone I’m fending for myself unfortunately. Family is either passed away or so far gone — mentally and substance-wise that I’m stuck man. Please give me help or just the most brutal of honest advice. I have no one else.

2025-09-03 02:32:44;I don’t know what to do.;"If anyone has gone through a similar experience, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions and opinions. For a little over a year, I have been diagnosed with GAD and depression. I’ve tried many medications and dosage adjustments—some made me feel better for a short time, others made me feel terrible. Somehow, I’ve come to the conclusion that I have atypical depression and, in a way, treatment resistance.

I still feel blocked, unable to concentrate, and it’s hard for me to memorize things, which has led to dropping out of my studies. It’s difficult for me to exercise, I feel stuck if I have to go somewhere, and I experience constant fatigue and drowsiness. It often happens that I fall asleep during the day even though I sleep 8 hours at night.

I feel like the people around me no longer believe me and see me as lazy. It’s hard for me to build social relationships; part of the reason is that I’m not understood, so I prefer not to get involved, and rejection would only make me feel worse.";r/depression_help;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1n6rjv4/i_dont_know_what_to_do/
2025-09-02 21:34:33;Frustrated about TRD;"Hello,

I have tried multiple antidepressants over the course of 4 years, noone of which has worked. It basically is treatment-resistant depression (TRD). I have had a strong head concussion in the end of '22, ever which everything got worse. I suddenly needed ADHD meds and got diagnosed and my Depression worked severely to the point where I had started taking O-DSMT (Tramadol metabolite so an Opioid) in all of 2024. It helped me manage ALL of the symptoms and I could really enjoy live again, taking it twice per day, always the same dose and never taking it to get high, just to the point where my depression was ""cured"", same for the physical pain I have. After that time, I sought out help, because my family forced me to and my mind told me that it is not optimal to self-medicate, so I got in Opioid-Substutution, which I have for now 9 months. Unfortunately, the med I am taking doesn't help my depression (levomethadone) in the slightest, is way stronger than O-DSMT, so I now have an addiction to a med that is way harder to come off from. Due to my terrible anxiety and depression, which makes life barely livable, I am thinking of withdrawal treatment, so that my tolerance will be at baseline again - just to take O-DSMT again - I can't see another option. I am absolutely sure I can handle that my usage will be controllable, as it was in the past. I just haven't had any success with other meds. O-DSMT is unregulated/legal in my country and easy to get. I just don't know what to do - I can't work, I can't do anything as I used to. Could I be correct in the assumption that taking an addictive substance is the lesser evil here or am I clouded by the idea that I just want my depression to vanish? If it is the only thing helping me live life - would I not be a fool to not take it? This is not meant to be a question where I except answers like ""no"" or ""yes"". I am thinking in the grand scheme. Are my feelings wrong for wanting to enjoy life - if I can handle it? I am not sure if this is the right subreddit - I hope mods can lead me to the right subreddit.";r/depression_help;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1n6jmmn/frustrated_about_trd/
2025-08-31 06:51:37;8 months in DBT group and individual therapy therapy and I still feel miserable and depression;For context I was diagnosed with BPD in 2017 and I started weekly DBT group and individual therapy in early January this year and have made a lot of progress in terms of practicing the TIP skills, relaxation skills, and DEAR MAN skills as well, however I still feel just as miserable and depressed as I was before DBT therapy. I have OCD as well, and my depression has been with me for many years, worsening over time. Ketamine, TMS, ECT and every class of antidepressant has not been able to tackle the deep emptiness and low mood I have felt. Has anyone been in a similar position? I am not suicidal, I don’t self harm and I am not aggressive with others, I just feel so disappointed that nothing so far has helped my mood.

2025-08-22 07:27:23;Anybody else feel like only dopaminergic medication helps?;"I could probably be most accurately diagnosed as having some sort of adhd/ocd/atypical depression combo (if you want to put a label on it) and I think the only meds that have truly helped me have been dopaminergic ones like low dose abilify and prescribed stimulants. 

I’ve been on SSRIs/snris/neuroleptics and even klonopin for a short period of time but none of them have relieved my anxiety and depression like the dopaminergic ones. Some of my symptoms are severe ruminating thoughts/ compulsive behavior, disorganization, severe social anxiety (RSD), really bad attention issues, a heavy bodily sensation due to the depression fatigue, oversleeping, and issues staying in the present. Honestly really irritated that I was never at least offered stimulants despite the fact that I’ve shown all the hallmarks of ADHD throughout my entire life, and I genuinely feel like it’s because I’m female. I do hope that I don’t gain a tolerance to vyvanse like I did with my past antidepressants because it’s really working well for me. I feel calm and clear minded for the first time in a long time.

2025-08-22 05:49:39;Tell the psychiatrist su1cd thoughts?;Hello! I would like an opinion on how to approach this issue with my psychiatrist. I've changed medications several times, I still haven't found one that works. In the last few months I realized that my depression entered another phase. I've always fantasized too much, I stay in false scenarios and live there. During my treatment I was diagnosed with autism and chronic depression. But now I only think about one scenario: people's reaction to the news about my su1cd and how it would pass quickly, everyone would go back to their routine in a short time and everyone would be fine, it wouldn't change anyone's life. This thought reassures me, it doesn't scare me. I don't know if the medications did this to me or if they just didn't work and now I realize what I really want. Has anyone ever told something like this to a psychiatrist? How it was? What do you think you can prescribe for me? If I say this, could my treatment change radically?

2025-08-22 03:43:37;Worried about being overmedicated;Hi so I’ve been diagnosed with major and persistent unipolar depression (treatment resistant) which I’ve struggled w since my early teens. Currently I am taking lamictal, Effexor and bupropion for my mood and are likely going to raise my dosages on these. I do feel better, not perfect but anything is better. I’m worried about being on too many meds being as I’m only 21. Is there an actual worry for this or should I accept my dependence on meds bc I need them. I don’t know if I find life worth living but more I’m apathetic towards it so I continue.

2025-08-16 21:31:37;Issues regarding dopamine regulation? (Long read lol);"I’ve been taking psychiatric drugs since I was 13 (mainly SSRIs at high doses), which worked decently well for me. As a teen I was diagnosed with severe depression and ocd. The issue was that they’d eventually stop working, and I would have to switch or start augmenting. 

When I was 16 I tried low dose abilify paired with Zoloft iirc and it improved my mood and cleared my mind up so much that it was unbelievable. Unfortunately, I developed severe acute dystonia and had to stop taking it. I tried other SSRIs and even cymbalta but nothing really worked like that again. They numbed my emotions enough for me to function… which was better than nothing I guess. I had a pretty healthy life nonetheless. At 19 years old I developed severe tardive dystonia while only taking cymbalta, and went off of all psychiatric meds until I was 20. When I was at the ER getting diagnosed my body was spasming so hard I kept slipping out of the chair. The muscle spasms I got from cymbalta took about 9 months to completely disappear. And to this day very very very mild muscle spasms will reappear randomly, which I never experienced before.

I was pretty low functioning while I was off of medication: I had severe obsessive compulsive behaviors, I was so depressed I could feel the heaviness in my limbs, and I was so sensitive to rejection + irritable that I avoided socializing and making friends, and. I was constantly distracted. A lot of these symptoms align with atypical depression/bp2. At 20 I was diagnosed with bp2 and put on lithium + seroquel. This helped some of my depression and it was better than SSRIs, but I was still pretty low functioning. Still depressed, still anxious, still having trouble focusing and completing basic tasks. I tried both Zoloft and Luvox again, and within the first dose or 2 I was having severe muscle spasms, my foot was moving around involuntarily, and I was grimacing uncontrollably. I also immediately felt suicidal and agitated (probably akathisia which is another movement disorder). I had already taken both of these medications as a teen and never experienced anything like that. I just couldn’t understand how this was possible - I was told it’s unbelievably rare.

Now I’m adding on vyvanse on to my lithium + seroquel and it’s given me that exact, clear minded feeling I had on abilify. Unmistakeable. So I did some research and found out that abilify helps increase/regulate dopamine levels at low doses, kind of like how stimulants work? I can complete tasks more easily, I’m barely depressed, my obsessive compulsive behaviors have almost completely disappeared, my mood is MUCH better regulated, I don’t feel the heaviness of depression in my limbs anymore, and it hasn’t caused me muscle spasms or akathisia. also I can talk to people much easier now? Even klonopin hasn’t relieved my anxiety like this has… I just feel really calm.

So it got me thinking: extrapyramidal side effects are indicative of dopaminergic issues, and my extreme vulnerability to them might mean that I have some preexisting problems with dopamine regulation? I also fulfill the criteria for both ADHD and atypical depression, which also seem to be caused by some sort of dopaminergic issue. I’m not a doctor and have only done cursory research into this topic but I think this is the answer to most of my mental health issues. I also feel like the individual disorders I’ve been diagnosed with are just different facets of this dopamine regulation issues. Also I’ve read that people with ADHD are like 2.4 times as likely to develop a movement disorder compared to the general population. Maybe this is all a coincidence but who knows. I am also curious if I would respond well to an MAOI, considering they raise dopamine levels too. I’m just annoyed at how many serotonergic drugs I’ve had thrown at me throughout the years and the insistence that my issues MUST be because of low serotonin or whatever.

If I had to choose the most accurate psych labels to describe my issuess it would probably be severe ADHD that causes depression, mood regulation issues, executive dysfunction, difficulty connecting with others, and behavioral loops plus atypical depression that makes me not want to leave my bed. I’ve also discovered that I was diagnosed with some sort of neurodevelopment condition in the 5th grade but I don’t know the details beyond that.

2025-08-16 08:54:52;Need help: ADHD, severe depression, and suicidal thoughts;"
Hi everyone,

I’m 36 and was recently diagnosed with ADHD without hyperactivity, along with long-standing depression and anxiety. I’m currently on medical leave due to a severe depressive episode and have been struggling with frequent suicidal thoughts for months.

My current medication is:
	•	Fluoxetine 20 mg
	•	Topiramate 100 mg
	•	Ritalin 10 mg, but I’ve been switched to Concerta 18 mg and haven’t started it yet.

My emotional situation has been heavily affected by an experience with a guy I met online (never in person) a couple of months ago. During a very vulnerable time for me, he did love bombing, showing a lot of attention and care, which led to intense limerence: idealization, obsession, and imagining he could “save me” from my misery. Since then, his behavior has been hot and cold, which has reinforced my rumination and emotional dysregulation.

I also find that I get very attached to people who give me even a little attention, which makes it hard to disconnect and increases my obsessive thoughts.

I feel that weekly therapy isn’t enough when I’m this overwhelmed, and that my medication isn’t helping to stop suicidal thoughts or the obsession with this person. I’m wondering if Concerta (or Elvanse) could help with emotional regulation and rumination, though I know stimulants aren’t a primary treatment for severe depression or obsessive thoughts. I’ve tried other medications in the past (Abilify, Pristiq 200 mg) and have had complicated experiences with side effects and activation risk.

I feel very alone, cry all the time, sleep a lot, and don’t know how to move forward. I want to get out of the loop of suicidal and obsessive thoughts, but I don’t know where to start or what combination of medication and strategies could help.

I’m looking for advice from people who have been through something similar, experiences with stimulants for ADHD and severe depression, and practical strategies to manage limerence and emotional obsession. Any guidance or support would be very valuable.

Thank you for reading.

2025-08-13 12:46:30;Hi, first time here;"Well, I've actually suffered from depression all my life. My childhood was a mess mixed with good memories, so that's left its mark on me.My mom is largely to blame for that, and even though I've gone through processes to overcome it, the fact that I even raise my voice to him causes her to have a crisis. She suffers from bipolar disorder and it's common for it to get out of control, so you can imagine how I feel all the time. 
I'm 24 and my mom threatened to hit me and I spent the whole way to work crying and feeling like complete garbage. That's the effect she has on me .
 I am currently diagnosed and was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication, but that funding ran out and I don't know if I should continue taking my medicine or just stop and try to be ok as I always do.
I don't know, I can't leave home because I don't earn enough money yet, I don't have friends or a support network, I've hurting myself (not seriously and I don't promote it) And I don't know if I should keep it all to myself and keep going, keep it working, I feel like I'm falling apart.

2025-08-08 02:33:40;23, living at home, feeling worthless and lost;"This is going to be hard to put into words but I'll try my best. I have never felt more anxious and depressed than I do right now. I graduated last year with a degree in art, and you can probably predict that this has not facilitated me in employment very well. It took me from august-october to find just a Christmas temp job, that ended and only got a permeant job in April which was only 2 days a week  and they let me go and month later. I've been trying to find work but it is so difficult. Not only because I rarely hear back, but I'm applying for anything and everything with no clear path in mind. I love to paint and draw and make music, but my lack of routine, structure and social life at home strips any energy/motivation/creativity to even pursue it. Even if I do, it won't pay the bills straight away so I need a more stable form of income. I trudge through creative jobs with big salaries that I am not qualified for and quite frankly don't even know what the role is. I just want to feel proud of myself and be financially stable. it's so overwhelming realising I have no clue what Im doing. I really cant understand how other people do. my friends are moving abroad and I am quite jealous not just because they have more money behind them but I don't even have an ideal destination in mind and cannot plan anything. im just floating through days.

I want to move back to my uni city where my friends are but obviously cant without a Job in mind, but I don't want to move out to do a job that will just barely pay rent  because that will depress me even more. I also am suspecting I may be neurodivergent - ADHD and/or autism because I am very self conscious in certain jobs due to the nature of tasks, remembering information and the social side with staff. I also cannot for the life of me make decisions  and organise at ALL and it brings me to tears and so much stress. it has stunted me for years and I am still so stuck. I fear I will continue is this loop. I am currently waiting fro a diagnosis but idk how long that will be and I cant go on like this. Im scared I won't progress financially, in career and love life. I know I have talent and worth I just cant apply it at the minute.

idk if any of that made sense, and its just scratched the surface. any words of hope or encouragement would be nice. I cant believe im acc asking reddit but whatever. ";r/depressed;4;4;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1mk837g/23_living_at_home_feeling_worthless_and_lost/
2025-08-06 10:04:49;I have nothing to offer to society so I feel I should isolate from it which makes me feel worse.;"I am 28. In January of last year, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and complex PTSD. I don’t have a car. I don’t have a job. I live at home with toxic family members. I don’t have a degree (I have 45/ 60 credits and it’s taken 4 years just for that). I used to be able to care for myself better but then my mental health started to worsen and I lost everything. Life has always been an uphill battle and I’m just tired of fighting it. I don’t have a lot of support and I only have two friends, of which only one talks to me regularly. 

I feel guilty because I have struggled since I was 13 with mental health issues and I have lost friends and partners because of my mental health and so I don’t want to put that on someone anymore, but I don’t get a lot of social interaction. It’s hard for me to even leave my room because I just don’t feel safe. However, I feel very alone and I feel like I have to be alone so I don’t cause anyone any more grief. I feel like I should at least have a job and a car to be able to make connections with others, but that’s just not attainable. I also struggle with just wanting to get better. I’ve been homeless and had to put myself through college multiple times and I’ve had to support myself more than some of my peers. In my childhood I was severely neglected. I just feel like if life is going to be this much of a struggle what’s the point of trying and struggling? At the same time, though if I’m not going to try, why would I intertwine someone else within my issues?

I wish I wasn’t here anymore and I’ve tried, but I can’t get past the idea that I will fail again and caused myself more damage than I already have. This is just a long-winded post of me saying that I’m very lonely and I’m very sad that I’m lonely and it’s my fault that I’m lonely, but I don’t see any value in fixing it because then I would have to pull someone else in and that’s not fair. 

I’m very upset that my life is this way and I’m upset with myself that I’m not doing anything to fix it.

i’m 17(F), turning 18 in less than 2 months, and even though i know i’m young, have a lot of time and all that stuff, it really doesn’t feel like it. I was diagnosed with depression when i was maybe 13 so i’ve been depressed through all my teens. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD/ADD and i’m on medication for that (i’m on antidepressants as well), i’ve been working all summer, going outside, forcing myself out of bed, using coping methods my therapist has talked about and basically doing everything thing right, but i still feel like nothing matters. I still feel so fucking empty and lonley, my friends keep ignoring me, making me feel even more unimportant, and at this point i can barely even imagine what my life would look like if i didn’t feel like this. 

Like, don’t get me wrong, i’m doing better now than i did 3 years ago. I don’t let my social anxiety control me as much, yk i can go to school, go shopping and hang out with friends, go to work, talk to strangers when necessary etc. But as soon as i’m left alone, and noting is there to distract me or keep me company, i break down and i’m stuck with the exact same feeling. I seriously can’t stand being in my own company because i’m the most pessimistic, sad, boring person i know. Even when i’m “doing good” and i’m outside and socialising, i just feel so zombie-like, if that makes sense.

A few years ago i struggled a lot with self harm. Almost 2 months ago i relapsed after 2 years, and it was kind of like a last resort. I have been begging for my friend to ask her older brother for cigarettes for months now (obviously haven’t got any) and i secretly started taking smaller amounts of liquor from my parents and “reset” my body or whatever just to get over the feeling. I even started looking for ways to get a hold of other stuff like weed etc. I just need an escape from all this. I want to FEEL something. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I’m fucking tired of it. 

If anyone read all of this, please don’t lecture me or tell me the whole “drugs are bad!” or “you’re young, you have so much to look forward to” bullshit.

Why I haven’t done I already is because I have 2 young children. The thought of them having to deal with the trauma of their mother killing herself is why I’m still here. They are my absolute world but I fear I cannot wait until they are adults to finally go. 

I’m sick of hearing people say I’ve got so much to live for, that I’m loved, I have a good life. Yet, I feel nothing. No joy, no happiness. Nothing. I’m just existing for the safety of my children and nothing more. 

I’m fed up of hearing it’ll get better, talk to me, I’m here for you when it’s coming from the mouths of fake friends. They don’t care. Why should they?

I see no point in anything, waking up each day and doing the housework, parenting, school runs, dinners… I’m a slave to my children and trapped here to keep them safe. It’s no life.

My doctors were worthless, had to see a naturopath to get diagnosed/cured so now I'm in debt. I lost all form of community and support so no one will miss me when I'm gone.

2025-07-15 01:00:29;How to live a perfect life?;"I literally don't know what to do. I am really sorry for my crooked English.

I am not suicidal. (And this was the only question that I have responded in positive)

I had a breakup very recently, don't know what is going in life, no real friends, no social interaction, life pressure, etc etc (I know these are common in everyone's life, but I need experts to help me sort it out)

As I am a student, let's first talk about student's life.

Student pressure -  
I am an above average student. (Yes, high expectations from everyone. Even I and my own parents have very high expectations from me)... Now I am (very) desperate to have friends and talk with people... But it just don't seem right.. Everyone is very busy in their studies, and it's true, why will they even talk with me when they have such load?  
I have wasted my whole 1.6 years by this, now I have backlogs which have to be completed in 3 months (2 years work in 3 months)... But, with all these pressures, I don't know I am just desperate to talk to someone who can understand me and help me. I spend my time scrolling through reddit, shorts, WhatsApp - just looking for someone to communicate on any topic.

Life pressure -  
My parents have spent their whole life savings on my studies (I am from lower middle class family)... I am given all the facilities to study. As they have spent their whole life savings on my studies and have taken a huge loan, they want me to study all the time (study, eat, sleep, repeat) and they aren't wrong. I am from India, here the competition is very very competitive and I have wasted (and is wasting) all my time. Now, as my father have scrap business, his business is slowly dying too. So, I will have to be a sole earner in my house that can support my entire family. (Statistically, it's only possible when I am from the very top college in my country). My parents and I does not even have any insurance, vehicle, nothing, we don't even travel, no saving account etc. My father works from 8 am to 10pm. My mother, who is housewife, always tell me to study - she don't want me to spend my entire lifetime just like them (i.e, having no leisure and safety)

Mental pressure -  
Everyone have very very high hopes from me. Not only this, the big question is - won't I be able to break the loop of this poverty? Won't I be able to travel with my whole family? What will happen when my father will suddenly diagnosed with any critical illness disease? The whole family will break and we will literally come on roads. My parents have not enjoyed their single life, they are turning old, as a son of theirs, don't I have duty (rather dharma) to fulfill all their dreams and provide them with the best healthcare possible? (I hate being poor, I lost my grandfather and maternal grandmother because of this reason, I don't want this to repeat, I don't want my parents to die without having any enjoyment)

Love life pressure -  
In my old school, it was mandatory for one boy to sit beside a girl. So, there was no sex discrimination. We used to think that both of them are equal.  
In my new school, it is mandatory for girls and boys to sit in two different columns, and when someone just says hi to any girl. The whole class (yes, even teachers) thinks themselves as couple. Moreover, in my school, regional language is used and I only know hindi and english - so it's difficult for me to communicate as well... (and obviously almost all of the people prefer their own culture over others...)  
Let's say I made it to any best university in India. The problem again is - Ratio is 10:1... So.. you know.  
Now, as in online social medias and movies I see, I see that boy and girl (strangers) approach each other, asks to swap numbers and start talking. Here, it's not feasible at all. I don't judge a person based on looks and how can I even know if she is good or not, without being friends atleast for a week?  
(And the reason of previous breakup was - miscommunication. She was my first friend and... )  
Just as boys, girls also judge boys (initially) on beauty and finance (not directly, but dates, gifts, etc)... (Yeah, because they do not have any parameters to judge because of the great partition created by my society)... And I am an average looking skinny boy, I master in making someone smile and happy for long period of duration (This is only possible, when I start talking to someone, which is not being feasible here and I am an introvert)

2025-07-13 21:59:07;I survived parental betrayal, abuse, cancer, and heartbreak, and I don’t know how long I can keep fighting…;"Hi Reddit,

I’m posting here because I have to get this off my chest, and I have no one else to talk to.

Growing up, I thought I had a perfect life—kind, hardworking parents, two younger brothers. But when I hit 5th grade, everything changed. My friends bullied me about being “poor,” and it led me down a path of stealing money from home just to fit in. My parents found out and punished me hard. I stopped, but in 9th grade, the bullying got worse, and I ended up making a series of mistakes including taking adult magazines and my dad’s old phone (with adult content) to school. One of my friends ratted me out, and I was humiliated publicly, especially bad since my mom was a teacher at my school.

Things spiraled. I self-harmed after a teacher screamed at me. My mom took me to a psychiatrist — who prescribed heavy meds (quetiapine 1000mg daily), possibly after being misled by my mom. I was taken out of school, isolated, medicated for years—and found out much later my mom had been in an affair.

Even after finishing my 10th and 12th externally, when I went to college, my family was falling apart. My mom left my dad, accused him falsely, and cut me, my brothers, and my dad off. She even involved me in helping her shift out. Later, my mom and her “friend” visited me, and I discovered she wanted w\*\*d—for her lover.

When I tried to confront her and say I’d stop the divorce, she called someone and arranged for me to be *kidnapped*. I was taken, drugged, beaten, and kept in a “rehab” center for months. I later learned my own mother had paid for them to do this to me. I was only fed rice water and onion for months. My dad found out I was missing and pressured my mom until I was released.

Not long after, I tried to speak to my dad about all this, it turned into a fight, I cut my hand badly enough to need surgery. That’s when I was diagnosed with blood cancer (CML).

Now, I’m only in my twenties, I’ve got 10 lakhs in debt, lost money to toxic relationships, and the only hope I have left is my wife, Komal. We’re an inter-caste couple—her family hates me, my dad barely supports us, and my wife sometimes seems distant too. I feel like dying every single day, like I have no love left in my life.

I started an initiative, Aidn Health, to help others with health and mental illness, but had to shut it down for lack of support. I don’t want to die invisible or unloved. I just want someone to understand, to know there’s still some good left in me, even after all I survived.

If you read this far, thank you. Please, tell me how to keep going, or at least that I’m not alone.";r/depressed;5;1;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1lythl2/i_survived_parental_betrayal_abuse_cancer_and/
2025-07-13 02:43:39;Depressed but not depressed enough?;"I’d like to start with clarifying that I’ve never been diagnosed with depression and don’t claim to have it.

For the past 4 years, I’ve lived in constant ups and downs - a few months of endless pain, hopelessness, self-hatred, loneliness, and suicide planning followed by a week or two of something that is as close to normalcy as it’s been since pre-COVID. The cycle continues and never seems to stop.

The thing is that I’m always “high-functioning” - I’m always keeping up with hygiene, meals, and grades. Everyone I’ve ever known tells me how enthusiastic, hard-working, and promising I am 24/7, so why don’t I feel that way? Sometimes I think that maybe it’s not as bad as it feels - I mean, “high-functioning depression” is generally considered to be mild anyway. But if it’s so mild, why does every screening tell me my symptoms are severe? (And I completely understand that screenings aren’t a diagnosis, it’s just smth I’ve noticed.) And even during my periods of complete brokenness, I’m not even in pain at every moment - the pain mostly appears when I’m alone or not talking to anyone, but I suppose that’s most of the day.

I’m also so lucky to have such a privileged life, so I don’t think I should feel like this - I think it may be genetic, since a family member of mine had clinical depression and is recovered. I also have one friend who I can always go to if I need to talk, but I feel bad bothering them because they’re such a happy person and don’t deserve to be brought down by what I have to offer - we’re also not as close as I wish we were, and they have plenty of other friends that they “choose” over me. I feel bad because I almost think I’m being possessive, so I try to let that friend live their life without me. For that reason, I constantly feel alone and isolated and asking for help just doesn’t come easily. I’ve tried online CBT a few times before, but all that does is bring me into a period of near-normalcy for a week before dropping me right back into a depressive period. I’ve tried a couple of other things, but it seems like everything I do only helps me for a short period of time. Maybe it’s because I lose all motivation for the help when I’m in that stage of brokenness, but even pouring everything I have into it while depressed hasn’t helped.

I just constantly feel so horrible but also not depressed enough. I’m currently trying to break some self-destructive habits like cutting but the scars keep triggering me horribly, and I’ve also had some personal food-related problems. Everything is just horrible and I don’t understand any of it.

Does anyone else feel this way?

2025-07-07 04:38:25;My Journey with Kratom and the Complex Science of a Misunderstood Plant;"For years, I lived in a state of muted chaos. A diagnosis of Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) had left my nervous system in a permanent state of high alert, manifesting as a crippling duo of deep depression and relentless anxiety. My world was a grey, muted landscape of emotional flashbacks and hyper-vigilance, where joy and safety felt like foreign concepts.

I was not a passive participant in my illness. I was a diligent patient. I walked the well-trodden path of modern psychiatry, trying one SSRI, then an SNRI, then combinations and other medications. Each one was a dead end. They either did nothing at all or saddled me with side effects so severe they were worse than the condition they were meant to treat. I was deemed ""treatment-resistant,"" a label that felt like a life sentence.

It was in this place of desperation that I discovered kratom. And it’s because of that discovery that I feel compelled to tell my story—to bridge the immense gap between the lived experience of millions and the fearful, incomplete narrative that dominates the public conversation.

# The ""Why"": Deconstructing the Science of Relief

My first experience with a measured, 5-gram dose of kratom was not a euphoric ""high."" It was something far more profound: it was quiet. For the first time in years, the screaming static in my head faded to a hum. The coiled spring of anxiety in my chest finally uncoiled. It felt like a warm, protective blanket had been laid over my frayed nerves, allowing me to simply *be*.

I wasn't just ""feeling better""; I was experiencing a complex pharmacological effect that no prescription pad had ever been able to offer. As I researched, I realized why. My C-PTSD wasn't a simple chemical imbalance; it was a systemic dysregulation. And kratom, it turns out, is a master of **polypharmacology**—a single substance that acts on multiple brain systems at once.

Think of it this way:

* Standard antidepressants are like a single tool. An SSRI is a screwdriver, designed only to work on serotonin. An SNRI has two heads, working on serotonin and norepinephrine.
* Kratom is like a Swiss Army Knife. Its active alkaloids, primarily mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, influence a whole suite of neurotransmitters:
   * **The Opioid System:** This is the most controversial and, for me, the most crucial. Its action on mu-opioid receptors provides powerful anti-anxiety effects and a sense of well-being, directly counteracting the terror of hypervigilance and the pain of emotional flashbacks.
   * **The Serotonin & Dopamine Systems:** This provides a more classic antidepressant effect, lifting the fog of depression and fighting the anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) that makes life feel pointless.
   * **The Norepinephrine System:** This helps with focus and energy, pushing back against the lethargy and brain fog that so often accompany trauma.

Psychiatrists often try to manually recreate this effect by prescribing a ""cocktail"" of multiple drugs. Kratom does it naturally. It was the multi-tool my complex condition had needed all along.

# Confronting the Stigma: ""But Isn't It a Dangerous Opioid?""

This is the first and most significant hurdle to any rational discussion about kratom. The moment you mention ""opioid receptor,"" the conversation is shut down by a wall of fear, driven by the devastating opioid crisis.

But this is where scientific nuance is literally a matter of life and death. Kratom is not a classical opioid. It is what’s known as a **""biased agonist.""**

Imagine two buttons that get pushed when a substance hits the opioid receptor:

1. **Button A:** Triggers analgesia (pain relief) and mood lift.
2. **Button B:** Triggers severe respiratory depression (the mechanism of a fatal overdose).

Classical opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone slam both buttons hard. Kratom’s alkaloids are ""biased""—they push Button A very effectively while only weakly activating Button B. This is why, when used alone, kratom has a vastly wider margin of safety regarding overdose compared to traditional opioids. It is not risk-free, but lumping it in with fentanyl is a dangerous and inaccurate oversimplification.

So why isn't this miracle plant being studied and prescribed? Because you can't patent a plant. There is no financial incentive for a pharmaceutical company to spend billions on clinical trials for a substance they can't exclusively own. This leaves kratom in a legal and medical grey area, where its narrative is controlled by fear, not facts.

# The Unspoken Contract: A Clear-Eyed Look at the Real Risks

To advocate for kratom is not to pretend it is a harmless supplement. To use it responsibly is to enter into a contract with it, with a clear understanding of the terms.

1. **Dependence and Withdrawal:** Let me be unequivocal: if you use kratom daily, you will become physically dependent. I have accepted this. The withdrawal, while not life-threatening, is real and deeply unpleasant, often described as a combination of flu-like symptoms and a severe rebound of anxiety and depression.
2. **Drug Interactions:** Kratom is a powerful substance that can interact with other medications. My own research into its interaction with my prescribed gabapentin revealed a high risk of **Central Nervous System (CNS) depression**. Combining them potentiates their sedative effects, which can lead to extreme drowsiness and dangerously slowed breathing. This is a risk I must actively manage through careful timing and dosage. **Anyone considering kratom must discuss these interactions with a doctor.**
3. **Lack of Regulation:** Because it is not regulated by the FDA, the market is a Wild West. Potency can vary wildly, and products can be tainted with contaminants. Sourcing from reputable, lab-tested vendors is not just a suggestion; it's an absolute necessity for safety.

# The Real Choice: A Rational Conclusion

When friends, family, or doctors question my choice, I explain that I have made a rational risk/benefit analysis. The choice was never between ""a life with kratom"" and ""a perfect, healthy life."" The real choice was:

**A) A functional life with a manageable dependence on a plant that allows me to work, maintain relationships, and experience stability.**

**OR**

**B) A non-functional life of incapacitating C-PTSD, chained to a carousel of ineffective prescription drugs with their own dependencies and side effects.**

I chose option A. I chose functional stability over non-functional suffering.

We need to change the conversation around kratom. We must move past the stigma and demand a more nuanced, scientific, and compassionate approach. For the millions of people living with treatment-resistant conditions, it is not a ""legal high"" or a ""dangerous drug."" For many of us, it is simply the only thing that has ever truly worked. It gave me my life back.";r/depressionregimens;13;40;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1ltbf0x/my_journey_with_kratom_and_the_complex_science_of/
2025-07-04 07:53:13;I’m on the verge of ending it;Hello, I am a 16 year old female and I have been struggling with depression for a while now like 5 or more years. I don’t know when it necessarily started but the depression really hit me when I was in 9th grade. I became very suicidal and I started self harm (Sh). It was a coping mechanism for me and it still is to this day, I am now in 11th grade. The school year ended and I was very sad because I won’t ever see my counselor again since she left the school and since I am moving schools because I got kicked out because of my mental health. They did not want to accept me anymore since I was a problem apparently. Really broke my heart I cried for 5 days nonstop and was debating weather I should overdose (Od). I’ve been sh clean for a month and a half now and I am debating weather I should relapse because I want to feel something. I just want all my traumas and pain to go away. I used to be abused by my dad verbally emotionally mentally and sometimes physically. I still love him but I can’t fully forgive him for all the pain he caused me and still causes me to this day. I just want to find someone who has a similar story because none of my friends seem to believe me. I find out that they have shit talked me and have been saying that I fake all the things I have been saying for attention. That really made me lose trust since I really trusted them with a sensitive topic to find out that they don’t believe me. I go to therapy but I haven’t seen my therapist in almost a month. I am debating to call her to tell her I am having suicidal thoughts and sh thoughts again and that I am close to ending it. I haven’t told anyone how I am feeling in over a month because I have no one to tell, my friend will either shit talk me or gossip about my problems, and if I tell my parents they will just tell me “don’t worry”, my therapist won’t do much either. I don’t know what to do anymore. Suicide is a sin in my religion but I don’t wanna live anymore. I’m stuck in between wanting to live and wanting to die. I have also been researching my mood swings, suicidal thoughts, self harm behaviors, depressive episodes, unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, the chronic feeling of emptiness and I found out that those symptoms are actually symptoms of BPD or bipolar. I don’t want to self diagnosis because I am not that type of person and I have tried hinting to my therapist about these symptoms but she just doesn’t do anything and I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Why and I like this what and I, who am I. I just want peace and I just want to die because I genuinely can’t do this anymore.

2025-04-21 09:13:31;Im tired and i’m so lonely;"

1)I’m using a phone so sorry for the format if it sucks 
2)English is not my first language 

Hi! Im a 20 year old woman and i’m having a mid life crisis now - Basically i have no one to talk to and i’m really lost so i need to get some shit off my chest 
Let me set some context about me: i’m 20, i’ve been taking care of myself mainly since i was 12 when my mom moved to another country for a job (my country has a immigration problem), my father (amazing guy he never abused anyone) died when i was 11, my mom has been an abusive narcissist her whole life who abused me, my older brother (35M) was my best friend but with years and after he moved when i was 9 out he became a bully and would treat me like my mom would, i have been struggling with severe chronic depression (i have been diagnosed by multiple specialists) my whole life, i have anxiety issue, self-harm problems and have a disordered relationship with food, i’m overweight.

Yeah i don’t know why that was necessary honestly i don’t know from where to start i never did the whole be honest and talk about your pain kind of stuff - it’s weird because i’m good at helping other with theirs lol.

So…..i’m lost i to be honest didn’t think i would be alive this long since i was 12 i believed i would die by 20 and to be honest there is a part of me that is at peace with the fact that when i die it’s because i would’ve killed myself 

My main issues right now: i will have a gastric bypass surgery soon and i want to quit my job

The surgery pretty cut and through topic - i have has BED my whole life and would often purge food, i never had a good relationship with food, i guess that’s what happens when you grow up in constant abuse lol, i’ve tried diets, the gym, supplements - everything in the book and i’m still overweight like a lot, so at this point i think going with the surgery is my best option. Thing is no one knows about the surgery besides one other person - i will take  a taxi to the hospital and back home - i’ll go through it all alone 

Now my job….we’ll for some context i am very lonely, i have no real close friend i mean i have ppl i’m friends with but i don’t think i can trust any of them with my pain and mental health cuz as cliche as it is they wouldn’t get it……but also to be fair i don’t really have any proper friends - so my coworkers became quickly ppl i care about (the fact that i’m an emotional person who gets attaches to people strongly help i guess). I’ve had this job for nearly 2 years but recently we are doing renovations in the office space so we work from home and i realised - i fucking hate this job, i love and care about the people (lots of ppl that listened and were actually there for me when i would be in pain, the only ones who actually celebrated my last 2 birthday with me and got me gifts, ppl who were nice to me, wiped my tears when i cried) but the job is killing me (thing is my job has some illegal aspects so like, borderline criminals and strangers have been the nicest to me in the last years and i have no idea how much of it it’s real or
to make me attached so i wouldn’t leave.
The job stresses me out insanely, i have no real stability with the pay checks (i can have a 7k month or a 500 USD month) and the savings i manage to get only end up being used in bad months (thank fuck i have no debt) so like…..i wanna quit but i’m so scared because i will lose ppl i care for (ppl in the industry have a very strict business - separate from - personal life mind) so to them i guess it will be just losing a business asset or worker but i will loose connections that to some extent kept me alive or well made it so i stayed clean between relapses easier and for longer 

——————

So yeah i guess that’s the main things right now - and for those wondering i’m already in therapy for the forth time in my life (which that is a whole different trauma because when i was underage sneaking around your abusive mom and going to therapy since 13 was hard); and i’ve been on medication before - it only helped temporarily - they put me on more and more meds ok max dosages but in the end they stopped helping and i would throw up daily from the amount of medication i was on.

I realise i wound like a loser in this post - promise i’m not, i have been independent since i was 12 and financially independent the moment i turned 18, i never got in trouble with the law, i try to be always be as kind as possible, i don’t have any debt, i was the one to pay for my fathers gravestone and monument at his grave (this maters cuz my brother would bully me about being a stupid useless kid yet im the only one who stepped up for dad), i pay the property taxes for mom’s houses because to be fair i live in it and on paper after my dad died i own 50% of it(she is in another country with a man i would easily consider a creep and asshole), i don’t cause problem and every time my mom has been in the country to visit even if she never truly loved me and i know she doesn’t really like me i support her financially, i speak 4 languages and i would like to think i’m not an idiot.

Yeah i don’t know i guess i want to prove with that - that i’m trying, a lot and i’ve tried my whole life but i’m really tired.

I honestly don’t know what to do next because to be truthful - why plan ahead a life that i will end at some point anyway - i don’t think i’m making it to 25.

I still feel like a dumb kid sometimes - you know that mitski song ,,and i was so young when i behaved 25 and now i find i’ve grown in a tall child” - yea that one hits.

I have no one to trust, no one to really be there for me and my mental illnesses are making me feel like i’m rotting from the inside.

I feel like i’m rotting 

And my chronic illness doesn’t help.

Im just really tired and lost

2025-04-19 03:30:35;It gets harder to smile every single day;"I don’t know what else to do.

I (51M) feel like I’ve reached the end of my story. I don’t know what else I can try that isn’t going to make myself just feel more hollow.

I  have never had luck with women. Although I have never been diagnosed, there have been signs all along that I am somewhere on the mild end of the spectrum. I have trouble reading other people, I can get overwhelmed in crowded noisy areas, I have food issues. For the longest time I was just known as the quirky art guy. I have literally hundreds of paintings, drawings, and other related crafts around my house. Everyone thinks I am great with people, but they don’t know the secret; I am only great with people because I pretend to be. I see how people act, how they speak, the things they do, and I have been studying them long enough to know how to emulate those actions. I am a good mimic. But the truth is, I feel like an alien living amongst a population that I do not truly belong to. But I always try to encourage others in art, in life. A rising tide lifts all boats. I try to rise like the tide.

Lying does not come easy to me. I know how to do it, and I can do it well, but it puts such a physical strain on me. I don’t feel like I am my best self when I am maintaining illusions of things that I don’t feel or believe. I also have a hard time keeping quiet when I think something is wrong.

It makes relationships particularly difficult for me. I’m not a particularly good looking man. I shave my head, I have a goatee, I’m a physically tall, large person. I basically look like I could be a scary dude, but I don’t like violence. People have a tendency to judge me by my looks, and are sometimes intimidated by me, so I go through life, trying my best not to intimidate people. So I’m very passive. I have a hard time meeting people, because I get anxious when I go out. Everything’s too loud, too bright.

Because of these factors, I am very timid when it comes to expressing interest in women. Even with the ones I had already been dating, I still moved very slowly and was overly cautious. And I get how that can be frustrating.

—-

The longest relationship I’ve had is with an exchange student I knew in high school. I’ll call her Ellin. We dated for a year after being penpals for 15 years, but most of that was long distance. We briefly discussed getting married so she could move to the states, but I wasn’t comfortable with that solution. We broke up because long distance wasn’t working for us anymore. I loved her, and I still do and always will, but being together just wasn’t going to work because I can’t live in her country and she can’t live in mine.

I found out about 10 years ago that Ellin had met someone else, gotten pregnant, and had an amniotic embolism. The baby died a little over a year later, and Ellin was left with severe brain damage, including memory loss, difficulty processing language, cognitive difficulties, and partial paralysis. I spoke to her sister, who told me that Ellin might not even remember who I was. I did not want to impose on her current boyfriend, so I did not ask her sister to explain who I was, I just asked that she kept me updated. Ellin and I have since been in touch. She does remember me, and I have even gotten to see her twice on visits to the US, but her cognitive difficulties and memory problems keep her from living an independent life. Her emails to me are usually just emojis and one or two words. I can usually get the gist of what she means, though the emails have a sad disjointed quality to them.

—

After that I got back in touch with another girl I first met in High School. I’ll call her Aura. Aura and I were both nature lovers, we would go on hikes all the time, we went out to dinner, got drinks, went to the movies. I thought I had finally found someone who was a perfect match for me. I finally worked up the courage to tell her I wanted to be more than friends, but she wasn’t interested. So we were just friends, and I was fine with that. I never put pressure on her, and we got along great. We became as close as two friends could be without actually being a couple.

in January of 2020, things were relatively good. But since that year, my life has been slowly falling apart, piece by piece, and everything I do to try and make it better has backfired.

My mom took a friend in off the streets to try and help them get their life back on track. That person ended up being a squatter that it took two years to get rid of. In the meantime, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Due to some poor life choices she had made, my brother and sister had very poor relationships with her, but after my father had died alone, isolated from anyone he knew in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, I vowed that my mother would not be alone, so I threw everything I had into her care.

In February 2021, my friend Aura suddenly told me she did not want to be friends anymore, and that our friendship wasn’t “going anywhere,” and that she wished me the best. As I had been the one to tell her I was interested in something more, but had been rebuked, this felt like an additional insult added to the injury. I had had previous girlfriends break up with me, and this felt like a break up. Rather than do what my years of experience had conditioned me to do, which was to grovel and ask how I could change, I told her that, while I didn’t understand, I would respect her decision, nonetheless, and I wished her the best in return.

I had been working at an amazing job helping people skydive as part of the ground crew. I loved it. I needed to get a second job, though, and I found a job at an art   Studio teaching people how to paint.

There were many times I wanted to touch base with Aura, as she was always very encouraging of my art, just as I was encouraging of her music. But I never did.

In July 2022, I had the virus that changed the world. Compared to most, I had a very mild case. But it also revealed a heart condition that required surgery. I had surgery on August 1, and the entirety of my recovery was spent taking care of my mother, who died the day after I returned to work.

During her funeral, I complained to a friend of mine that Aura hadn’t reached out to any of this to see how I was. My work friends, who at this point we’re pretty much the only true friends I had, were very supportive, but my skydiving job was seasonal, and I hadn’t seen any of them in person since my mom passed.

In March 2023, I found out that Aura had taken her life the previous August. I was unaware, because her family did not want it known how she died.

In April 2023, I returned to work when the skydiving job opened back up, and tried to throw myself into work to take my mind off of everything. In late May I was having a rough day, and I left my keys with one of the office personnel in case they were needed and clocked out because it was slow, which I commonly did to save the boss money. My boss took that opportunity to fire me, claiming I had abandoned my job while he was out of town. He would not listen to any explanation I offered.

So I threw myself into my other job at the studio. The company I worked for is very unscrupulous, and they have many policies that I disagree with. I was able to edit myself significantly, but whenever my opinion was asked for, I offered it honestly and as professionally as I could imagine.

Last year, I met someone (I’ll call her Melissa) at the studio. She was a customer, so I could not approach her socially. She already knew how to paint, but she was recently divorced and would come to the studio to socialize with other artists. I took an immediate liking to her. She is smart, and funny, and kind, astonishingly beautiful. But because she was a customer, I did not want to make her uncomfortable by making advances at her.

I also began hiking in earnest that summer. I love being outdoors, and I attempted to hike the Paumanok path, a 120+ mile  running through half of Long Island all the way out to the Montauk lighthouse. I made it through almost 60 miles before difficulty with my feet made me have to quit. It affected my work, and  I could no longer stand for long periods of time, and accommodations needed to be made to allow me to sit.

This March, I was fired from that job when I spoke out against the company for not protecting three of our artists from being harassed by customers.  And one of the many negatives of that firing was the thought of never getting to see Melissa again.

But a coworker said that Melissa had stopped by and had specifically given my coworker her number to give to me. I was so excited. I felt like this was the first good thing that had happened to me in five years.

So I resisted all of my instincts which were screaming at me to leave her alone, and I texted her. And our texts very quickly became epic long conversations, with many deep revelations. She lamented not having anyone to talk to, which resonated with me tremendously. She confided in me on a surprising number of topics. We exchanged photos both of ourselves and of our past artwork and works in progress, and discuss the difficulties and achievements with that artwork. I told her I wanted to be better at portraits, although she said the work I had shown her was amazing. We talked about relationship experience we had had, and that both of us had been hurt before, and we agreed that we needed to take things very slow. And we made plans to go on a hike and share a picnic lunch afterwards. Later that week, I actually did a portrait sketch from one of her photos, and it is honestly some of the best work I’ve ever done.

That Sunday, that picnic, was the best day I’ve had in a long, long time. We walked for over an hour, covering every inch of that park at least twice, and then sat on a blanket and had our picnic. I found out just how incredible a person she is, about the trauma she’s been through, and how she is writing a book to help others grow from her own trauma. I talk to her about some of my trauma as well, including what had happened with Ellin.

I did not want the day to end. She was so kind and empathic, and I have not felt that comfortable with anyone ever on a first date. I felt like I had found someone else who was a perfect match, twice, in one lifetime. Eventually, the cold got the better of us, and we had to end our picnic. On the way back to our cars, I told her I hoped we could see each other later in the week for dinner, and she agreed. It was an amazing day.

Again, because I have a hard time reading people and understanding social conventions, I made a “dating mistake” and texted her later that evening thanking her for such a lovely afternoon. She texted back immediately thanking me as well. Then she texted me again later that night to thank me for the dessert that she had taken home from our picnic. We chitchatted for another few minutes, and then I made a second apparent ”dating mistake” and showed her the sketch that I had done from her picture. I got no response, but she commonly fell asleep during our good night texting sessions, so I wasn’t alarmed.

—-

What did alarm me though, was I checked my email, and got a completely different surprise. Ellin had sent me an email that started with the words “help me“ and finished with “K-1. Visa?” With numerous emojis in between. (A K-1 Visa is a fiancé immigration visa.)

Ellin wants to marry me. Despite the fact that we live on separate continents, she requires constant care, doesn’t fully understand her condition, and cannot take care of herself.

i emailed her sister to tell her what was happening, and she told me that Ellin doesn’t understand that that is not a practical solution. Her sister told me she appreciated me emailing her, and would keep en eye on her sister to see her reaction to my response. And I had to email Ellin to tell her I would be unable to take care of her financially,  and that I had moved on with my life. She wrote back to tell me she had a lot of money (her sister told me she did have some money, but not enough to live independently in the US) and listed all of the medical treatments she had endured asking me again to help her get  K1 Visa. I had to tell her again that I was sorry, that I couldn’t marry her. She sent back a single word: “Coward.”

—-

As Melissa and I had been texting every day, and almost all of our exchanges started with her wishing me a good morning, I started off our Monday exchange wishing her a good morning. Right from that next response, I sensed something was different. I was also distressed by Ellin’s conversation. The previous level of excitement was nowhere to be found. Given my social ineptitude, I was worried that I was overthinking things. Having not set a timeframe for our dinner that week, I asked her if it would be too soon to take her to dinner on Tuesday. She said that did not work for her, and that she needed to move very slow, which is something we had both discussed in our texts previously. I told her there was absolutely no pressure. The next day I sent her a greeting text and showed her a painting I had been doing of a landscape. She responded a few hours later very cordially. And because I am an overthinker, I was convinced I had done something wrong.

Turns out I was not overthinking things. She texted me and said she was not ready to date yet. I apologized if I made her uncomfortable, and I understood that me asking her out again so soon after our first date defied traditional social norms, but hoped she would forgive me for my excitement. She said I did nothing wrong, that she just didn’t think she had thought things through enough.

There are a good number of things that my brain doesn’t understand about dating, but I know what that really means. “It’s not you, it’s me,” is a lie designed to spare the feelings of the person hearing it, but it never doesn’t hurt. I don’t know how to lie and pretend I’m not interested in someone, and I don’t know how to not be excited when I see evidence they like me back.

So now, I find myself once again wondering how it could get worse, and knowing that every time I’ve said that it happens. A perverse thought has entered my head on more than one occasion this week: I did a skydive back in 2019, before I knew I had a heart condition; maybe I died, and didn’t know it, and everything that has happened since then is just me slowly descending into the depths of Hell. My first real love, that is no longer mentally whole and whom I am unable to care for or have a meaningful relationship with, thinks I am a coward for admitting I mark unable to take care of her in her condition. My mother goes through Hell, fighting to evict a malicious presence from her home, and dies of cancer. My best friend, my perfect match, pushes me away and then unalived herself. I lost a dream job. They literally opened up my chest and took pieces of my heart out. I tried to achieve my hiking dream and had to stop. I lost ANOTHER dream job. And now I’ve been rejected by ANOTHER perfect match.

I’ve gotten to the point when I just don’t see the point of putting my heart on the line. It hurts too much. I’m tired of being lonely.";r/depressed;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1k2dfxx/it_gets_harder_to_smile_every_single_day/

1 year ago(maybe a lil more) i decided its best i dont have friends. I do have a girlfriend, but im too emotional and dont feel comfortable talking about my feelings to her.

All in all im too broke to help my mom, and too much of a loser to have any real friends.

Ive gone as far as to block people i used to ask to hang out with all the time, and thats partially why i left everyone. It seemed no matter what day/time/year/drugs/liqour/sober, EVERYONE is always too busy. Then they would text me about how much fun they had with so n so, only to still never ask me to join.
I almost texted somone i used to think of as a friend today, but decided to block them too.

I dont think anyone will notice, im a loser who no one sees as some one they need in their lives. Im just the easy going nice guy always asking if someone needs help. All i wanted was for someone to do the same for me.

2025-04-11 08:48:56;My paranoia is worsening;"I have been diagnosed with clinical paranoia. My paranoia is getting worse as I can no longer distinguish between reality and hallucination. 

The toxicity around me is suffocating me. Everyone seems to wear masks of ""good guys"", pretends to be good until they're exposed of their true nature. I don't even know whether I'm abused and gaslighted or I'm overeating. There are evident, patterns, traces and signs to point out that it's them, not me and I should stop punishing myself for every sin I'm accused of. I know I'm not perfect, but it's unfair for me to be condemned of things that I didn't do. No one allowed me to defend myself. Even with evidence, they still want me to bear the sentence. 

I am feeling like I am losing my mind. My loved ones told me that I am alright, that people are cruel and that it's not my fault that I was defending myself. But how can I trust their kind words? What if they only said so to console me because they couldn't bear looking at me hurting myself? The people who condemned me told me that my moral was flawed, that I was the one doing harm and it was me all along. 

Am I the monster? I know my mentality is not the best for judgement. I'm doubting myself, was I the asshole? Was I gaslighted? I am confused. 

Pills after pills, therapy after therapy, counseling after counseling... I have had enough! Nothing helps. Please stop asking me to get help because there's none for me to get. ";r/depressed;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/1jwdj0d/my_paranoia_is_worsening/
2025-04-09 12:59:28;Prescribed Vyvanse for mood / anxiety (not ADHD!) and potential withdrawals from coming off it?;"Current medications: 30/45mg mirtazapine daily, 40mg vyvanse daily, 40mg propranolol daily, 5mg Valium as needed (usually 2 times a week, usually take 10mg instead of 5mg)

TLDR: Presribed vyvanse 40mg daily for mood/energy/anxiety, I don’t have ADHD. Side effects relating to sleep (waking up in the morning and staying up past 8pm) are horrible and I want to come off this shit. How bad/manageable will the withdrawals be if I drop down to one pill every other day for 2 weeks or even cold turkey quit?


I don’t have ADHD I never got a diagnosis for it and I told my psych when we first met that I didn’t believe I had it and didn’t really have attention/focus issues. I’ve been seeing this psych for over 3 years now and 3 months ago he gave me 40mg vyvanse for mood, energy levels and to help with anxiety. I have tried a LOT of different meds to help with anxiety and none of them really worked, so he suggested vyvanse and I said sure.

The first month it worked pretty well but I’m now almost 3 months into using it and the side effects have gotten a lot worse. I can barely get out of bed every morning I sleep in way too much and when I finally feel like I can get out of bed I immediately have to take the vyvanse or I’ll fall back asleep. I also crash out around like 8-9pm every night and can barely stay awake after then, doesn’t matter when I go to bed either I still struggle to get up in the morning. I do still get more energy during the day but honestly I feel gross getting up at 10am most mornings and would rather get off this shit altogether.

So 3 months of daily 40mg vyvanse, how bad are the withdrawals gonna be if i stop taking it? I know it’s bad to try and self taper without ur psychs advice but I don’t have another appointment for 3 months and with how cooked our psych system is in my country I won’t be able to get an earlier appointment that’s less than 1-2 months away anyways. I’ll be able to manage a few weeks of fucked sleep and shit energy, I’d rather go through that right now anyways while I’m still job searching rather than later when I’m employed. just wanna know if dropping down to one on one off (taking a pill every other day) for two weeks or even going cold turkey is gonna cause any major health issues?

2025-04-05 22:06:31;I chose not to die. I left loaded weapons on the table and walked to the hospital.;"I’m 38. I’ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I’m doing well—career, family, stability. But inside, I’ve spent years quietly falling apart.

My first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn’t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.

One night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it—I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.

Eventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn’t brave—I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.

At 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn’t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.

I didn’t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day—and I’ve never forgotten it.

A doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I’d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.

Since then, I’ve stayed sober. I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pokémon cards. I told myself it was “investing,” but really, I was spinning out.

When I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don’t know what I am—other than confused.

Now, even with meds and sobriety, I’ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It’s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don’t fully understand what’s happening inside me.

I’m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still—some days I feel like I’m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.

I guess I’m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don’t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:

2025-03-25 21:49:24;Need some advice on my current situation 30/M;"Hi All,

I am hoping to get some advice from this community pertaining my current situation.

First off, i (32/m) am diagnosed with a ""mood disorder"", ADHD, CPSTD, OCD My psychiatrist did not really give what mood disorder do i have, but he mentioned that it is in a spectrum, which i do understand what he meant by that.

I am seeing my psychiatrist in a private hospital instead of a public hospital, as the treatment in the public hospital is very bad. And there are no insurance coverage for any psychiatric conditions in my country, despite my country claiming we have the best healthcare in the world.

So i am playing close to 1200 USD a month just on medications.

# Treatment Resistance

To add on to the mix, i have significant treatment resistance. My country does not offer any other treatment expect for Esketamine and ECT
I am not keen on ECT as the risk is too much, while Esketamine is extremely expensive, i am looking at 45,000 USD every 6 months.
Neighboring countries do offer other treatment for both long term and short term; such as cannabis. But it is a crime to consume cannabis regardless where i am consumed it in my country. 

# Relapse:

My Previous relapse was in Early September 2024 to Late October 2024 And now i am back to relapsing, in less than 5 months.
When i ""relapse"", i experience the following:

## Depressive mood:
Sudden and rapid decline of mood depressive episode.

## Su1cidal thoughts:
Uninitiated SUi thoughts, that rapid fires.
I also experience this where i am subconsciously finding for something to be depressed about, which then trigger more su thoughts

Before i seeked treatment many years ago, i was abusing alot of alcohol
i would sit down and consume alcohol while watching a suicide scene in a movie replayed on loop over and over again.
(I am 2 years sober now, thanks to vyvanse)

But as of recent relapse i have been craving alcohol. Thankfully i have not fallen into the trap.

## Crying spells
It either i feel like crying and i cant cry, or i just randomly start crying
Current Medication stop working
While on stimulant


While i am on my sitmulat, i am still experincing the affects of the relapse but i would be able to get out of bed, and get things done, the moment i stop doing activities even for a minute, everything will come rushing back, this also occurs when the simulant's effect is done for the day

## Current Medication
I am currently on the following medication and dose i am taking which was altered every couple of weeks when my relapse started about 3 weeks back

- Venlafaxine (VIEPAX) - 300MG; taken in the morning
- Vyvanse - 70MG Taken in the morning 
(i am allowed to skip, i was only able to write this post as it took it in the morning.)
- Olanzapine (Zydis) 10MG; taken at night
- Mirtazpine (Rameron) 30MG; taken at night

## Unable to sleep
Even with Olanzapine and Mirtazpine, i find myself unable to sleep. I had tried to take Dayvigo, which sometimes works and sometimes it does not.
I had tried Xanax 1.5MG, which worked initally after the 3rd time taking it,
it stopped working, now it does nothing to me.
I had tried Clonazepam, which had the same issue as xanax. Essentially all benzos do not work for me.

With the current medication cocktail, in the initial days, it seemed to had been working, my mood was somewhat stable.

However, as the days went, it stopped working.
Then i went back to my doc, he altered the dosage And Same behavior, worked for a few days and then BAM! stopped working,

And i honestly at my wits end, i am very lost. I do not know what to do anymore. I have already missed a month of work, in my current situation i cant go back to work, that will definitely take a hit on my career
And yes, i have tried therapy, again i am resistant to it, to make it worst, there is no requirment for theapist to be licenced in my country as such there are many ""scams""


I can't eat, i can't sleep well, i cant do anything.
What should i do. I really do not know what is going on with me, and i am really exhausted and i want to give up

Has anyone been thru this and managaed to fix it?";r/depressionregimens;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1jjjsdh/need_some_advice_on_my_current_situation_30m/
2025-03-24 05:13:46;Understanding my depressed partner;"I met my partner 4 months ago, and it was utterly wonderful, it was like we were made for each other. He told me about his depression diagnosis, however he hadn’t had an episode for quite some time.

His background is quite extensive, and he hasn’t had the best of partners who understand him. But with us, it just clicked and worked instantly.

He was off work with holiday, as he had some to use, and we were having the best time, however the day he returned to work, he was sent home for the rest of the week, as he was struggling. He’s now been off for over 2-months.

He ended up having a mental breakdown, which I had sensed he wasn’t quite acting himself. Anywho, I had continued to check in, send him messages, telling him about my day despite him not responding, which I’ve been understanding with, because his energy hasn’t been there, but the occasions he has messaged me back, he’s been empathetic to how I’ve been coping because it’s be tough for the both of us, but he hasn’t said anything or insinuated about us not being together, he’s occasionally said about how he feels awful about me waiting for him, which of course I would, because I love him.

Fast track to recent weeks, he’s had some further devastating news within the family, as well as intense appointments for his mental health, and I messaged him a lighthearted message, as I had been doing, and he wasn’t as he would usually message me. It was more on how he’s struggling with this, and how he’s a long way from where he is wanting to be. I haven’t struggled on where we stood this whole time, because I knew he loved me, and what we have is just so wonderfully special, that waiting wasn’t even a question for me. But since his last message, I’ve been scared. I will obviously keep waiting for him, but has anyone experienced something like this before? How have you handled this, do you keep the contact up?

2025-03-19 04:11:04;What to try next?;"Hi everyone,

I have ADHD and Depression that’s manifested as low energy, low motivation, apathy, and low confidence for the past 5+ years or so.

I’ve been taking ADs or Stimulants since I was 15 and initially diagnosed with ADHD. It started with Adderall and then Vyvanse - it was fantastic at lifting my mood, seemingly fixing all of my ADHD issues, but the crash was always brutal. I’m still on a low dose of Vyvanse now about 13 years later. It’s been extremely helpful for my concentration and mental energy, even if it only works only ~6 hours a day even at higher doses.

When I turned 21, I was diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety and I started on my antidepressant journey. I started with Wellbutrin and it seemed like that was the trick - much greater energy, motivation, no apathy, and joy. That was until 3+ years later when it seemed to poop out. 

Since moving off of Wellbutrin I’ve given a solid trial of Parnate, Selegiline, Desipramine, Pristiq and Vortioxetine with limited success. The one drug that made a big impact was Nortriptyline - it felt even stronger than Wellbutrin. But unfortunately I had side effects of anger at high doses and addictive behavior even at the lowest doses so I had to stop. I wasn’t able to control my eating or masturbation after enough time on it.


Now, I’m trialing Atomoxetine (3 weeks at 80 mg) while staying on a low dose of Vyvanse and I feel tired, unmotivated, and depleted of energy. 

Given my trials of various meds my psych mentioned low dose Antipsychotics (Vraylar, Ariprazole) or even Lamictal to see if either could put a dent in my low energy depression. I’m debating these options or to just go back onto Wellbutrin on top of my other meds.

Can anyone with similar experiences or advice chime in? Would love to get some feedback or any additional info here. I’ve been down so many rabbit holes around drugs, I just need some guidance here.";r/depressionregimens;3;27;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1jeel84/what_to_try_next/
2025-03-03 10:58:41;Buying a home in WA State is incredibly depressing;"7 years ago, I was widowed at only 25, we were both 25, freshly out of the Army which is how we met. My best friend & husband died from stomach cancer were 99% sure he developed from the toxic fumes from burn pits while deployed in Afghanistan in 2011-2012 (google the PACT Act if you are curious/looking for more information.)

We started dating in 2013, a couple months after he got back; we met in the hospital by chance, basically the saddest love story you might hear besides The Notebook, not trying to inflate or pump it up but, yeah this app really happened to me…

He died within 5 months of his diagnosis at stage 4, we seriously didn’t know he even had it as we both had been eating very healthy as I had just had our second daughter 7 months prior. 

Yes, I was left with 2 kids ages 1 & 3, with absolutely ZERO FAMILY SUPPORT, as my family was estranged at the time because they were upset at me still for having my first daughter (from him) out of wedlock (they’re old fashioned Christian conservatives.) So I picked myself up after that, we were homeless 2-3 times because we lost everything: our home, our car was repossessed because I was a stay at home mom when he got sick, and then I had no one to help me with the kids after he died or even while he was dying, so how could I keep a job, if I couldn’t afford the state childcare copay even!

The VA denied his sickness was service connected until 2024 due to them being like “that doesn’t exist” and Biden passed the PACT Act so finally we got the backpay or retrograde pay for what we deserved from his death.

I finally got to buy a home & put $40k down on a home, but because I’m a single mom even though I receive 3 INCOMES & I WORK!, I can only qualify for a loan of $150k because when he died my credit was wrecked to 400. I’ve built it up to 635. It’s apparently still not good enough to get into a mobile home park, which is the only home I can afford in this expensive ass state! 

So if you live in Washington State & wonder why people can’t get homes, hello! This is why! I’m a veteran, widow of a combat veteran, working sober single mother & I can’t get approved into a mobile home park because my credit score yet I can be approved by a lender!!! wtf?!?!?! How does that make any sense?!?!? Makes me want to unalive myself I swear to god.

IVE WORKED SO HARD & IT FEELS LIKE FOR NOTHING! I’m going to have to be a fucking renter forever and everyone will judge me for it. Yet I have $60k+ in my savings right now! Yeah.

2025-02-15 06:20:39;I live everyday like there is this huge fog over me that won't ever go away;"I truly believe that all the antidepressants I have taken over the years have done something to my brain. I don't know if it's some kind of brain damage but I truly believe they have caused more harm for me than good. It's like they changed my whole personality and not being able to feel any emotions. I know because I was never like this before I started taking them.

I was 11 years old I think when I was put on my first antidepressant because a psychiatrist I met at the time had been given me many different medical diagnoses. I was diagnosed with autism, selective mutism, social anxiety and OCD. When I was diagnosed she put me immediately on an antidepressant called Sertraline. I took Sertraline for maybe four years. I had to quit taking it though because it made me gain a massive amount of weight over time and it also caused severe sexual dysfunction. I gained 20 pounds on it because it made me so hungry all the time I couldn't stop eating on it. I stopped Sertraline and lost all the weight I gained on it.

My psych then decided to put me on another SSRI instead called Luvox primarily for my selective mutism and OCD. I started taking Luvox when I was 15 years old and I took it for six years but I decided to go off of it because it made tired, sleepy and gave me brain fog. It also made me emotionally numb. I literally couldn't feel anything anymore. I was like a zombie and I had no emotions at all. My mind was totally blank when I was on it.

After that I got a new psychiatrist who put me on Prozac instead because it was supposed to be more activating than any other SSRIS I took before. I didn't take Prozac for a long time though because it caused severe fatigue, sleepiness and brain fog. It also caused severe sexual dysfunction and it made me emotionally numb just like Luvox and Sertraline did.

I started taking Wellbutrin two years ago hoping it would help me with my severe apathy, avolition and anhedonia. Unfortunately Wellbutrin hasn't been able to reverse the apathy, avolition and anhedonia caused by all the SSRIS I have taken in the past.

I'm totally apathetic and anhedonic now. I have absolutely no emotions anymore and my mind is totally blank. It's like I have this huge fog over me that will likely never go away. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I don't enjoy being social anymore and having social interactions with other people makes me feel nothing at all. I can't have any friends or relationships because I know those friendships and relationships wouldn't last for long because of me not being able to feel anything and having no emotions. I wouldn't have anything to contribute with and with my severe sexual dysfunction I wouldn't make a relationship last for long. I don't enjoy doing my hobbies either like I used to before. It's like nothing matters to me anymore and I couldn't care less about anything. It's like i'm just here alive as a person but I'm not living my life at all.

My life was never like this before I started taking SSRIS. I know how I was before and I wasn't like this at all. Every psychiatrist I meet now keeps shutting me off because they don't know how to treat it. They keep blaming me for me being like this and thinking that i'm the problem. I wasn't even depressed when I first started taking my antidepressant. Just because of all my medical diagnoses I was forced to take a SSRI that I was not willing to do and not knowing either that they would cause these issues later on. I hope it's not too late now to reverse the damage but I doubt it. I'm probably going to live like this for the rest of my life.";r/depressionregimens;15;6;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1ipmoee/i_live_everyday_like_there_is_this_huge_fog_over/
2025-02-08 06:27:37;Is lamotrigine / lamictal possibly the cause?;"I’ve been on / off multiple meds over the years for a combo of ADHD + depression. For whatever reason, one issue I have is a rapid cycling of emotion; I can wake up feeling hopeless, then a few hours later, feel happy/normal. 

I’ve mostly gotten used to this to a degree but my psych wanted to try to treat it with Lamotrigine, which is most commonly prescribed for bipolar. For what it’s worth, I was diagnosed years ago with BP2 but the bigger, longer shifts have “mostly” subsided. 

That said, I started the regimen of 2x25 a day in November. I know it’s a low dose, but it actually seemed to smooth out the mood shifts and the early morning sads mostly went away. 

However, over 2 months later, I find myself feeling sad and uneasy almost all the time. I also find myself easily irritated / angry. I just don’t ever feel “good”, unless I have a bit of alcohol which is obliviously not a solution. There’s a constant feeling that the worst thing that can happen, will. 

I’ve avoided looking up side-effects so I don’t get any psychosomatic symptoms but at this point, I’m just not feeling well and and thinking it’s probably that med specifically. (I also take low dose adderall and bupropion but lamictal is the most recent addition.) Any thoughts, ideas?

2025-02-07 21:17:35;What are some lesser known but useful antidepressants?;"What are some antidepressants that are not so common but are actually useful?

For example, Opipramol or Agomelatine (though Agomelatine may be well-known)

I have diagnosed ADHD + chronic fatigue syndrome and antidepressants often work very well for both conditions.

I would especially like to know if there are any unusual drugs that act on noradrenaline. (In this case, it doesn't matter if it is not defined as an antidepressant.)

I have treatment-resistant ADHD and unexpected drugs sometimes work. (However, any small amount of drugs that increase dopamine such as methylphenidate makes my ADHD worse. Maybe I am deficient in DBH. Drugs that increase noradrenaline are often the most effective for me. However, it is strange because Prozac worked for my ADHD. I have very little anxiety, but Prozac improves my task processing ability.)

I would like to know if there are any unique psychiatric drugs that are not so common, such as Opipramol or Agomelatine. I have already tried bupropion, but it was a big minus for me because it acts slightly on dopamine.

Most of the SSRIs and SNRIs I tried were not very effective. I sometimes feel that Lamotrigine and Memantine help improve my ADHD, so it is possible that unexpected drugs other than antidepressants can help my ADHD (in that case, I would like to use it even if it is not in the category of ""antidepressants"". If such a drug exists, I would like to know about it.

2025-01-26 03:49:33;help with med changes and new despair;"Hi all,

After a series of depressive episodes in my 20s in which I cycled on and off SSRIs until I experienced some poop out, I (50f) was put on a cocktail of 150 mg Effexor and 300 mg Wellbutrin. I took this for 20 years and remained stable, without a depressive episode during that time.

During the pandemic, I started having more residual symptoms and entered full fledge depression last year (2024). My mood has slowly tanked and gotten worse. A previous psychiatrist boosted my Wellbutrin to 450 mg which did not help. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and was put on  Ritalin, 20mg/d. I also tried TMS but did not have success.

In the past week, I have gone from depressed to despair. I never feel anxious and now I have  continual feelings of dread and doom. I  have been the most suicidal I have ever been and am considering going inpatient or at least taking a leave from work. I literally feel like each minute is difficult to live through.

Some of the despair may be cumulative or due to the inauguration and other events but I made some med changes during this time and I wonder if others have had similar experiences.

Starting late November, my psychiatrist put me on 2 mg Abilify, after a month, we went to 4mg, and about 10 days ago to 5mg. I haven't really seen any positive benefits so far and wonder if it is making me worse. We also went down to 300 mg Wellbutrin.

Also, because I have so much fatigue and there is a possibility I have long COVID, an integrative doctor put me on LDN (low dose naltrexone). We started at 0.5mg in October and have titrated up in 0.5 mg increments. I am now at 2.5 mg and again, have not noticed benefits and wonder if it could be making me worse.

Lastly, my psychiatrist had me change from 20mg Ritalin long release to 10mg 2 x day Adderall. I want to eventually reduce my use of stimulants and because I did not feel the Ritalin was doing much, he switched me to Adderall. Again, I wonder about the timing of my worsening symptoms.";r/depressionregimens;4;8;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1i9vbc4/help_with_med_changes_and_new_despair/
2025-01-08 00:24:50;What are some novel treatments for chronic fatigue?;"I don't have any cognitive depression symptoms, but taking tricyclic antidepressants greatly reduces my brain fog and chronic fatigue.

However, the problem is that even the smallest dose has too many side effects on my heart and my liver values rise abnormally, so I can't continue taking them (is drug hypersensitivity a common symptom of CFS?)

Imipramine, Nortriptyline, and clomipramine all worked for me, so most tricyclic antidepressants may work for me.

In this case, if I can't use tricyclic antidepressants, what medication would you recommend for me? (Of course, the basic premise is that treatment methods vary from person to person, but if there is something similar to tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects, I think it would be effective for me.)

The symptoms I'm suffering from are brain fog (feeling of pressure on the brain), abnormal fatigue, abnormally low cortisol levels, erectile dysfunction, waking up in the middle of the night, dry eyes, and acne.

These all developed almost simultaneously after experiencing chronic stress from the age of 15 to 17.

I have also been diagnosed with mixed ADHD and ASD, but for some reason, taking tricyclic antidepressants improves both. (Even though I have been diagnosed with ADHD, all stimulants have the opposite effect. Drugs that increase dopamine make me manic.)

LDN didn't work for me at first, and neither did Mestinon

Cymbalta, an SNRI, worked for my brain fog at first, but it stopped working after two months.

I would like to try anything I can, even if it's not tricyclic antidepressants.

I don't mind the risks, so if there are any promising treatments (medicines), please let me know.

However, almost all supplements and Chinese medicines have been completely ineffective, so I feel that nutritional therapy and supplements have their limits.

I would like to find a revolutionary drug that will change the situation. I have a hunch that it may be a drug related to JAK inhibitors or autoimmune disease.

Diagnosed MDD (dysthymia) and ADHD (inattentive), anhedonia, PE, overthinking, and rumination. Blood tests also show extremely low serum serotonin and dopamine levels.

Tried increasing Effexor dose (did not work), Fluvoxamine (increased anhedonia and emotional blunting, but helped with rumination), and Bupropion (made me angry and anxious). Concerta worked well for executive functioning but tanked my mood.

Did some genetic testing, turns out my consistent depressive mood and ADHD are inherited. I got heterozygous MTFHR and slower MAO. Also two long-form 5-HTTLPR alleles (indicating higher serotonin transporter activity) and reduced 5-HT2A receptor density in the prefrontal cortex.

Would atypical antidepressants like Trintellix and Viibryd work better for me due to 5-HT2A antagonism? Genetic tests also show reduced CYP2D6 activity, but it wasnt a problem with effexor.

2024-12-27 05:36:28;Experiences with Latuda for Dysthymia and Double Depression;"I’ve tried many antidepressants over the years, and I also gave Abilify 10 mg a shot. However, I had to stop it because, while it helped in some ways, it greatly increased my appetite. On top of that, I have a tendency to gain weight easily, along with lipedema and PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), which makes things even more challenging.

My diagnosis is dysthymia with episodes of double depression, and my psychiatrist has suggested this regimen:
	•	Latuda 18.5 mg
	•	Pristiq 150 mg (recently reduced from 200 mg due to significant fatigue and weight gain)
	•	Topamax 100 mg (to help with impulsivity around food)

Right now, I’m on 150 mg of Pristiq, but I’m hoping to eventually lower it to 100 mg if possible. If not, I’ll keep it at 150 mg, as 200 mg felt like too much and left me feeling extremely fatigued.

The goal of adding Latuda is to prevent such intense depressive episodes and help me become a functional person again, as I’m currently not working due to my mental health struggles.

Today is my second day on Latuda, and so far, I don’t have that “foreign body sensation” I experienced with Abilify. I also don’t feel overly activated, which is a relief.

If Latuda doesn’t work, my psychiatrist mentioned possibly trying Cariprazine. However, they said Lamictal wouldn’t be indicated in my case, even though it’s usually weight-neutral.

Has anyone had experience with Latuda for dysthymia or a similar condition? How did it go for you with this medication or any of the others I mentioned?

2024-12-26 20:34:24;The uncontrollable urge to twitch muscles;So I have been a patient of OCD and I remember vividly when it started back in 2003. I was just 15 and I kept getting this incessant urge to twitch one or mor of my muscles. Sometimes I twitched my eyes, sometimes I got this urge to look behind my back, but mostly I twitched my muscles in the stomach area. It all felt funny and light at first but then things started getting pretty serious. These incessant twitches started hurting me after sometime. I wanted it to stop so bad but couldn't help it and couldn't understand why I was voluntarily twitching my muscles to hurt myself.But the urge was too strong.I also had severe episodes of misophonia. Further the struggle was not limited to twitching, my brain began f*cking with my thoughts too. Wheneve I tried to read for exams or anything it did something so I couldnt read anything or atleast cannot understand what I read. Sometimes it was the sound of a far away bird, sometimes it was the dripping of water nearby, sometimes it was some other repetitive sound, and when there was no sound my breathing caused drew all my attention to it. It was super hypervigilance for any repetitive sound or thought which could just break my concentration. Finally I was diagnosed with OCD and since then I have been more or less suffering from this twitching sometimes to lesser extent sometimes to greater. Anxiety was already there and I didnt realize while in this hellspace when depression also crept in. I am 35+ now and the battle is ongoing. Meanwhile lifelong metabolic disorders also plagued me. I was diagnosed with hypertension when I was 15 and have been on meds since then. I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes when I was 25. A lot of time and years wasted fighting with my own mind.

2024-12-23 21:43:54;Moclobemide low dose + mirtazapine + armodafinil combo? For depression amd ti improve adhd a bit ;"tried all the ssris, snri' venlafaxine and nothing helped my depression.  I tried moclobemide before and tragedy at lower dose 75mg twice per day itnfelt much better than higher doses. High doses made me uninterested in my usual activities. I also have adhd which impacts my depression a lot and I'm on a waiting list so it will take a year or two until I actually get diagnosed. 

Armodafinil and modafinil always improved my depression and anhedonia but I never taken it in while I was on other meds. At the moment I started taking mirtazapine 15 mg and it does feel different than all other antidepressants. It does take the edge off depression but is not enough.

I was thinking to combine moclobemide 75 mg x 2 a day + mirtazapine 15 mg at night amd also armodafinil on the days I need extra boost of concentration. 

How safe amd effective is this combination in your opinion?

I feel like this combination will be slightly balanced in terms of serotonin,  dopamine and noreadrenaline. I did feel that moclobemide is more dopaminergic in lower doses but above 250 a day serotonin overrides the dopamine effect. Also mirtazapine antagonists some serotonin receptors thar moclobemide might agonise so it probably could increase the effectiveness and reduce so,e soe effects ( actually I had no side effects on moclo XD)

Also by antagonising certain serotonin receptors it increases dopamine which will be further potentiated By moclobemide mao inhibition. Also moclo suppresses rem sleep so I think mirta could improve that issue. 

What worries me the most here is the addition of armodafinil to moclobemide as I haven't dome it before and many places says its contradicted.  I only taken modafinil with mirtazapine and it felt good. It actually brought my blood pressure down amd made it more stable (got dysautonomia and blood pressure variations)

Also mirtazapine at 15 mg is quite light but if I was taking with moclo and then increased mirta to 30 would it be risky?.

2024-12-20 10:47:54;Please analyze the cause of my chronic fatigue (brain fog).;"I am currently suffering from severe brain fog and chronic fatigue. To be specific, I cannot even walk to the supermarket 100 meters away.

This brain fog and chronic fatigue started when I was about 17 years old (long before the corona pandemic).

Until then, I had been diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, so my brain may have been vulnerable, but the brain fog appeared after chronic stress like trauma that I experienced between the ages of 15 and 17 (however, it is unclear whether the brain fog appeared after chronic stress by chance or whether there is a causal relationship).

Other physical symptoms include

insomnia, erectile dysfunction, dry eyes, acne, low libido, low cortisol, and drug hypersensitivity.

Also, I have never had a headache more than five times in my life. I recently started to think that this is strange too. (So, in my case, is the true nature of the brain fog a headache of insensitivity? This may be a difficult expression to understand.)

Furthermore, my brain fog starts at the back of my head and is relieved when I wear a hood or take a certain posture. I've hit my head hard a few times in the past, so I wonder if there's a problem with my cerebrospinal fluid?

I also have PEM and crashes.

And there's something unnatural about my ADHD, stimulants don't work for me at all (they actually make my hyperactivity worse), and GABA-active drugs and antidepressants solve it.

I barely have any mental symptoms now, but at first, taking Cymbalta or tricyclic antidepressants dramatically improved my brain fog. But then it gradually stopped working. (This is also unclear, and rather than it not working, it may be that I was taking antidepressants and the brain fog was gone, and then I was too active outside, and now I'm having a reaction to that.)

I'm 24 years old, and while everyone around me is moving forward in life, I'm bedridden.

How can I get out of this state?

2024-12-05 13:57:42;Might be having a serious breakthrough!;"Okay so…I am diagnosed with ADHD and refractory major depressive disorder. Over and over again I’ve come here and tried to iron out different med stacks and supplements on top of that. I’ve tried countless variations and I just never seemed to make any real headway. 

I have mostly responded very well to stimulant medication. It always helps and works quickly. I finally got my PCP to put me on Vyvanse. We’ve been tirating up 10mg a month, but I’ve had mixed results. I couldn’t make up my mind whether I should take my Effexor with it or not. I’d stop and then convince myself I needed it but then when I’d start I’d swear it was greatly diminishing the effect of my Vyvanse. I always had a “feeling” this was a case back when I used to take Adderall with it too…the meds just didn’t seem to work right…I actually went crazy as far back as December 2017…I had been using White Kratom a lot. But from the day after I started Effexor it NEVER worked like it did before. I kept trying over and over and couldn’t get it to work. But everyone said that shouldn’t have any effect. 

I finally kind of realized…the only time Effexor ever worked for me was when I was also on at least 400mg Welbutrin SR. All this time I just assumed my stack required an SNRI and that Wellbutrin was an “add-on.” But once I was prescribed Vyvanse, I figured I should just take one or the other…as I anectdotally thought maybe Wellbutrin messed with my stimulant medication too. 

I FINALLY just had a revelation…my symptoms are not feelings of worthlessness. They are just total disinterest in anything and everything. I also noted in the past…even quitting Effexor which is notoriously hard, I can do it CT with zero issues. So I said okay…Wellbutrin has worked for me in the past but then “pooped out.” Id have a brief honeymoon on 150mg, then 300mg…and when on Effexor I required 400mg to get any response. 

So my deduction was…okay: Let’s drop the Effexor since it never has caused me any problem. I’ve trialed countless SSRIs and SNRIs. Enough already. Let’s make Wellbutrin my primary medication! I’ve never actually tried that. I’ve been dosing 300mg XL for two weeks, quit Effexor 4 days ago, and started 60mg Vyvanse today …I feel LIKE MYSELF for the first time in SO LONG. I CARE about stuff! I have hope for the future! I can feel sexual feelings for the first time in YEARS. I can focus but also laugh and relax. I’m hopeful some of this crazy weight gain was tied to the chronic SSRI dosing too. 

For those interested this is my current regimen

My Core Mental Health Meds:

Welllbutrin XL 300mg (MDD/ADHD)

Vyvanse 60mg (ADHD)

*Suboxone 8mg (Chronic Pain/MDD)

Suboxone was actually a desperate attempt to breakthrough. But I am seeing that it’s not needed. I am already on the sublocade shot so I expect to resume quitting altogether. 


Other Meds that be helping as well

Lyrica 450mg (Chronic Pain/Anxiety)

MetFormin ER 1000mg (Prediabetes)

Diclofenac 150mg (Chronic Pain)

-Lyrica is well known in this sub and can definitely offer a very pleasant mood boost but that does wear off after a few months. Now I like it for it offsetting any overstimulation from the Vyvanse/Wellbutrin combo and supporting my sleep. 

-MetFormin has a lot of proof as being a great add-on to a primary anti-depressant. If you have any insulin resistance that could be your depression right there. 

-Diclofenac is an NSAID but also has shown promise as an adjunct. NSAIDs are gaining. Steam as Depression is more and more found to be tied to inflammation. Ibuprofen and Naproxen help too, but supposedly Celebrex is the best NSAID for depression and gut health, so I may switch to that.

Supplements

Daily Probiotic 

Omega 3 1000mg Daily

Vitamin D 50,000iu Weekly

Vitamin B Complex

L-Tyrosine 2,000mg 

Magnesium Citrate 200mg Daily

I swear by probiotics for staying regular and having healthy bowel movements. I’ve long struggled with constipation and nothing helps more than a good probiotic. I use the NOW Foods brand. 

-Omega 3 has the most support for treating both ADHD and Depression of anything over the counter that I know of. EPA and DHA literally are needed to make the neurotransmitters Serotonin and Dopamine. Following on the NSAIDS, they reduce inflammation as well.

-Vitamin D in my experience is moreso preventative, I don’t think it helps if you’re not deficient. But it’s safe and seems good for your general health.

-Vitamin B Complex and L-Tyrosine are just neurotransmitter food. Haven’t had much direct benefit for Tyrosine since the first time I tried it years ago. Probably won’t buy it again. 

-Magnesium has countless functions. Citrate can be a good laxative but hefty doses of 300-500mg at once can increase GABA and relieve some symptoms of anxiety. 

Please don’t give up everyone. Above all else TRUST yourself. And try to resist the urge to start too many meds together. Take one and see how it affects you. Otherwise you’ll have no idea what’s doing what! It never occurred to me to take something OUT of my stack. And it appears that dropping the SNRI was the best thing I’ve done. While I’m sure this no hard and fast rule, this does seem common for those of us with ADHD. SSRIs and SNRIs commonly aggravate symptoms.

I’ll report back in a month to see if this keeps, but I am highly optimistic this is no fluke. ❤️

2024-12-04 20:08:32;Ginseng reducing my depression & anxiety;"It‘s day 2 (!) of taking Panax Ginseng (500mg extract, of which 100mg are ginsenosides). I started with the belief it will be not working just as everything else I tried, just wanted to use it as I paid it and it was laying around too long, expiring soon. But strangely the last 2 days I experienced a big very significant relief in my symptoms of my diagnosed depression and anxiety.

AS it‘s ONLY DAY 2 and very very common for people to placebo after starting some supplement and then be claiming really early that this works wonders and cures diseases after just starting, I just want to ask you guys about 

- your experiences with ginseng (similar?)
- and knowledge about its psycho-pharmacological properties that might be influential and affecting mental health, depression and/or anxiety (to the level or type that I noticed now).

First day, yesterday, hour or so after I took the first Ginseng capsule, I noticed my depression (low unstable mood, anhedonia, lack of drive, negative thought/spirals etc.) and anxiety (generalized,  
social anxiety) was suddenly much much better. Like a lot. 

Mood is stable and good, positive. Anxiety is away. I can get out of bed again, go into public and out of my apartment again, I answer call/ and do calls again, I shower and brush my teeth again, I move, I don‘t lay in bed all day anymore, I make myself something to eat and eat more again, I find pleasure in these things and others and have a better outlook again, my thoughts are way more positive, I have a lot of more energy in comparison (also physical - before I was almost wheelchair level regarding my physical energy and movement a day, not trying to exaggerate, before even moving a finger was like oh man this is kinda exhausting). I also have a better focus again and can think clearer, remember stuff and feel way less brain fog.

Today, second time I took it, is the same.

Of course I would come back after prolonged trial of this and post about my experience if it really works and gets clearer that I really experience this insane symptom reduction of Ginseng.

2024-12-04 15:54:29;This got me emotional;"3 years after a diagnosis of MDD & CPTSD and this is the first time seeing the words “in full remission”.

I’m so used to seeing the words “recurrent” & “chronic” that this has got me a bit teary eyed 🥹 

Wellbutrin 300, weekly Psychology sessions, monthly Psychiatry sessions, low dose Xanax (ad hoc basis only) + lifestyle changes with the aim of potentially weaning off meds next year.

It hasn’t been a linear process, with a few set backs, episodes of relapses, long periods where I just couldn’t face therapy, changing Drs a few times, trying to come off meds unsuccessfully. 

Nevertheless I feel a little pride inside today.

2024-12-01 18:14:58;Anyone else in this sub dealing with Anhedonia and Depersonalisation/Derealisation at the same time?;"I've tried many meds in the past 12-13 years without much success while dealing with Depression, Anxiety, OCD, ADHD and Aspergers. About 3 years ago I started dealing with a lot of weird symptoms like extreme fatigue, tingling and pain in certain areas of my body, nausea, regular headaches, temperature dysregulation, intense brain fog etc. 

I've been assuming it was intense anxiety, it felt like something very wrong was happening with my mind and body. About a month or two after this I had a terrible experience with weed and soon after I was dealing with Depersonalisation/Derealisation and intense anhedonia. 

I've had lots of tests done by doctors but they haven't been able to find anything wrong in the tests that I've done. I'm currently dealing with constant tingling in my hands and feet and I get weird pains in those areas as well. 

Medications aren't helping much. I'm currently on Clomipramine, Propranolol and I've just started rexulti. The symptoms that I'm dealing with are similar to what people with POTS and Peripheral neuropathy deal with but I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.

2024-11-14 01:35:31;Other options for Treatment-Resistant Depression/Mood Disorder;"So hi.  I've had some kind of depression since I was like maybe 11, maybe younger. There was a trauma in my childhood. But I didn't accept help until I was 19. Since then, I've tried a ton of meds, as you'll see below. I also have anxiety, PTSD and maybe ADHD, but I dont have a diagnosis for that one. So all I know is depression and some comorbidities. I'm at a point where I'm desperate for something to help - I haven't felt this hopeless since I was a suicidal teenager. I'm in my 30s now, and I feel like I've run out of options, and I'm just falling falling falling into the abyss. I need something to cling to. I usually have some kind of program or new medication to try but everything is just weighing me down.

So this is me begging for help. See my details below, if you get through it all, you're a star. 



 I've done ketamine infusions 12x, ECT (8 sessions I think, maybe up to 12? I can't remember), and rTMS twice, on two different places on my head, one at the front, the other at the back. I've also done mushrooms 4 or 5 times. None of them helped. Nothing. Nada. Zip.



I've had a number of psychiatrists, including some that just straight up said there was nothing they can do for me, but for the past 7 years or so I've had a psychiatrist I trust. So I'm 33 now, and 19 when I started meds - so 14 years of drug treatments (give or take as I did do a few 6 months stints clearing all meds out of my system). 



So below is a list of the medications I've tried. Literally the only one that has helped my depression is 6mg rexulti. And I still feel depressed, but not suicidal anymore. I'm still on amitriptyline for migraines, and prazosin for nightmares and hymnopomic hallucinations (I don't have schizophrenia or other disorders that cause hallucinations). Also side note, I find all the other medications do literally nothing, not even side effects, so maybe I have a squiggly brain. Who knows  - not me.

Medications I've tried:

cipralex, wellbutrin, mylan-mirtazpine, lorazepam, pristiq, sertraline, venlafaxine, cymbalta, prozac, abilify, gabapentin, trintellix, seroquel, trazadone, zopiclone, effexor, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, ketamine infusions (x12), ondansetron, anafranil clomipramine, phenelzine, lithium, zolpidem, citalopram, parnate, viibryd, moclobemide, modafinil, vyvanze, minocycline, cytomel, lithium, amitriptyline, rexulti, concerta, lyrica (pregabalin), adderall (amphetamine XR), luvox (Fluvoxamine), propranolol, clonidine, acetylcysteine, prazosin (for PTSD nightmares and hallucinations), buspar, lamotrigine, paroxetine.



I'm also in therapy. I've done intensive CBT - wasn't for me. Acceptance and Commitment therapy made more sense, and I'm still working with that. DBT i know little about but I'm waiting for a program to start where I live (hopefully in the next 6 months). 



So basically, I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and that I've exhausted my options - I feel incredibly hopeless and just completely desperate to find something that makes a difference for the better. 



My mood has been etremely low, I've been sleeping a lot as an escape (and yes I know that doesn't help), I have panic attacks about being alive and having to live feeling as depressed as I do. In the periods where my mood is extremely low I get strong urges to self-harm (I have a good support system set up so I haven't in almost a year.  (let me know if I need to edit out the next sentence but:>! I phantasize about doing long, deep cuts down my forearms and legs so that I can see all the different tissues and layers and stuff and I feel like maybe if I did that doctors would take me more seriously and be more inclined to actually help me in some way, I don't think about it in a it'll kill me way, more like a maybe it will visualize how I'm feeling way. !<

 Then my mood flips and I feel completely apathetic. I should mention during both of these moods I stop taking care of myself. I don't eat unless someone hands me food, I don't brush my teeth or my hair as much as one should, don't shower as often, I sit and do nothing for long periods of time. I disengage with everything around me and stare off into nothing a lot. 

  
A VNS implant is the only other thing I can think of, and I have yet to find anyone in Canada who does it for depression. I'm in Canada, looking to go down to the US to do it if it comes to that.

  
Please, does anyone have an other suggestions on what to try? I'm hanging on by a thread and I don't know what to do.

2024-11-09 12:28:25;Feel numb? ;"I've been ""officially"" diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD since I was 31 (2019). Been on Sertraline 150mg and Bupropion XL 300mg, and then of course Adderall (both XR and immediate together). Oh and Trazodone 50mg for sleep (if needed, which I only took it a handful of times because it makes me feel like shit the next day).

I feel like none of my medications work. It's weird. I still have no drive/motivation to do anything, and my boyfriend keeps telling me he feels like I have no emotion or seem to care about things (which I'm starting to notice too). Are there any supplements that could maybe help? I saw someone mentioned folate supps helped their meds work better. I'd rather try that before I go to my NP to ask for a switch in dosage/meds. 

It was tough in the beginning of my diagnosis because the Sertraline zapped my libido to zero until they added the Bupropion. 

Also, anyone else feel like Adderall does nothing for them? I take the 20mg XR 1x/day and 10mg 2x/day and I feel nothing. My brother takes the 20mg XR and it super works for him. Frustrating. ";r/depressionregimens;3;6;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1gn22ig/feel_numb/

I told my doctor I think I might have OCD and she didn't even hesitate to prescribe Abilify. I've only ever taken Lexapro and Mirtazapine so I don't know what to expect. 

She had me taking only Mirtazapine for a week because I mentioned I was been having trouble gaining weight and sleeping through the night even on the Lexapro. But it gave me horrible side effects and I think I was experiencing withdrawal from the Lexapro so I stopped taking it and switched back. Now I told her I feel as though my depression and OCD tendencies have come back in full swing (only been back on the Lexapro for a week) so she prescribed the Abilify. I was told they can't increase my Lexapro dose and this is why she prescribed the antipsychotic.

2024-11-05 01:16:00;There is some evidence for lamotrigine for unipolar depression, not only for bipolar illness;"I have been diagnosed with depression since end of 2015 and I have gone through multiple meds - SSRIs, Wellbutrin, mirtazapine, Seroquel, Latuda, as well as rTMS. I have not heard about lamotrigine until this year, I was prescribed it in March. Lamotrigine so far actually has been the only medication that has been sort of helping me with depression and even anxiety as well. I am really wondering why I was never offered it previously, what's the risk in trying, if a person is already clinically depressed? And from what I know, lamotrigine is not even that risky of a medication.

My current psychiatrist believes that there is evidence that lamotrigine can help not only those with bipolar illness, but also patients with unipolar depression. I think more doctors should consider lamotrigine. I have read several articles and found some positive evidence.

[2006 study - unipolar depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16845646/)

This study had a sample of 14 patients with treatment resistand depression. All were treated with lamotrigine as an adjunct to other antidepressants for at least 6 months. In bipolar depression, the drug may be more effective against depression than lithium, which has been shown to be more active against mania. It is also known for is its ability to improve social and occupational functioning of patients.  
In this study, all patients with psychotic disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, and eating disorders were excluded. Tolerability is generally comparable with that of placebo when it is used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Twelve patients of the total completed the trial, and two discontinued treatment. There was significant, rapid, and robust resolution in symptoms in all effectiveness measures, including the core symptoms of depression, as shown by the changes from baseline in CGI-S, and MADRS at 8 weeks.

Side effects - one patient discontinued treatment after 8 weeks due to the development of a scalp rash. Other patients reported mild drowsiness, somnolence, decrease in sexual desire. Also reported were mild transient headaches and dizziness; another complained of dry mouth and nervousness.

  
[Lamotrigine for persistent depressive diosrder - case report](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919124/)

Up to two-thirds of adult patients do not achieve remission with SSRI treatment and there is limited evidence identifying reliable predictors eg , demographic , clinical , or genetic characteristics of individual response. Lamotrigine may be effective for treating patients with antidepressant resistant persistant depressive disorder.

Case presentation: We describe a woman who was diagnosed with PDD. At the age of 38, the patient presented with anxiety, reduced energy, marked tiredness, and sleep disturbances. She was prescribed with three antidepressants (paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine), which were not effective in relieving her symptoms. She was also prescribed bromazepam, which was also not effective. Subsequently, she was switched to lamotrigine, which resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms. Lamotrigine improved unipolar depression resistant to antidepressants. It also improved anxiety symptoms being free from benzodiazepines.

  
I'm very happy that my psychiatrist did inform me about lamotrigine and suggested it, so if you have treatment resistant depression and you haven't tried lamotrigine yet, it's something to consider!";r/depressionregimens;19;18;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1gjjl6k/there_is_some_evidence_for_lamotrigine_for/
2024-10-30 22:36:42;Considering trying Wellbutrin (or something else) again to help motivation;"I've been on Wellbutrin before, but was drinking a lot at the time so wasn't really able to give it a fair shot in hindsight.

Long story short, since leaving my job months ago after it got super toxic and high risk for my future (they were getting into bank fraud and other totally unethical things), I've just been struggling with slumping motivation. I'm not feeling depressed, I just don't have a lot of hope and find myself quick to give up. I've made progress in fixing this via therapy and positive activities like volunteering to bring my self worth back up, but I keep thinking I could use a bandaid to help while I do the hard work. Wellbutrin is especially appealing as I've been struggling with quitting vaping nicotine.

I do struggle with anxiety, but it's normally not crippling. I know Wellbutrin normally doesn't help in that department. But usually when I feel confident, energetic, and productive, my anxiety drops. Like modafinil used to help with my anxiety somewhat.

Have you found Wellbutrin to be effective for lack of motivation? I have so much I want to do, but I just keep avoiding it for a myriad of reasons.

Or, what else have you found helpful?

I am diagnosed bipolar II and take lamotrigine for it, but I have learned I have to be careful with antidepressants. I was extremely motivated on Nardil, but after I stopped, I realized it was pushing me to the edge of mania. Nefazodone worked great for me, but my psych took me off it as he thought it was destabilizing me. I was going through a rough period several months into treatment then started drinking a lot, and I think it was more that. But also I am mostly outside of the US now, and Nefazodone isn't available in other countries.";r/depressionregimens;7;1;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1gfo1js/considering_trying_wellbutrin_or_something_else/

# Can benzos mask other disorders?

I’ve been on benzos since I was 20 (53 years old now). I can wean myself down to the smallest dose when somewhat stable and have even managed to get off here and there but wind up needing again to function (always reluctantly as I do not want to be on these but anything we’ve tried solo never seems to get me functional). What’s in the past is in the past but I wish I had never been prescribed them for severe panic attacks with no warnings of dependence or anything. I cyclically struggle immensely with my recurrent depression, anxiety, ocd and cptsd and adhd. In retrospect I am starting to think that my issues when young could very well be rooted in bipolar 2 and adhd and this could be why they have never seemed to be controlled very well on any of the many meds I’ve tried. Is it at all possible that the benzos have masked hypomania symptoms over the years? When young I was aggressive, oppositional, explosive, beyond impulsive and anxious to the point of agitation at times. SSRIs seem to help some but completely blunt me. Trintellix made me euphoric for a few weeks and then threw me into DP/DR and agitated anxiety. Risperdone did help after a bout of PPD which presented as agitated anxious depression with obsessive thoughts. Weaned off due to weight gain. I’m just wondering after much reading and research if the chronic benzo usage is masking symptoms or keeping them at bay so that I can be properly diagnosed and treated. Would this make any sense at all? (Benzo being low dose klonopin. Raised at times of distress and then brought back down at times of stability). I can’t help but feel that something is missing with my diagnosis/treatment.

2024-10-09 11:17:28;Help, I am confused.;"I just need to get this out of my mind.
Yes, I have tried looking for a second opinion. 
Yes, I am still confused. 

I started off with a depression diagnosis from an online psychiatrist and he prescribed me Mirtazapine. Still, he recommended me to go in-person. So I did, and the other psychiatrist continued Mirt, adjusting the dosage. But when I mentioned the probability of ADHD, she brushed it off, saying it should have started from childhood. That time I had not tried to recall anything yet, so I just accepted the diagnosis. 

Later on I realized that as a child I was not even trying to be tidy, I misplaced things, but I performed well at school, so I really am not sure if anything started back then. I had rolandic epilepsy when I was 9, and completed treatment when I was 11. Don't know if it matters.

I tried many things including going to a psychologist, who thought I might have ADHD but after making me do a qEEG test she scraped the idea completely because I do not have the ""typical ADHD brain scan"". I also did another screening by doing a TOVA test, but I didn't make enough commission error and zero omission BUT my response time was awful, so I got -8 score. Based on that the psychiatrist that assessed me told me I have anxiety problems. 

So I went back to my original psychiatrist and diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (F41.2). BUT she also prescribed me Methylphenidate for my focus problems. While my mood improves, my forgetfulness and distractibility do not go away. I went to yet another psychiatrist a few weeks later. I told him I needed a second opinion and I have problems focusing. He didn't even try to convince me, he just showed a list of symptoms and asked, ""Do you answer mostly yes?"" and I was like ""yeah..?"" He told me I might have ADHD! But he told me to work on my depression and anxiety first. 

I went back to my original psychiatrist a few days after that encounter, and the first thing she asked was ""Did your focus improve after taking methylphenidate?"" I answered yes. She was like ""you do have the inclination to ADHD!"" But it confused me even further, since she did not change my diagnosis.

Should I just wait for things to work out? Am I crazy looking for second opinions?";r/depressionregimens;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1fzi6he/help_i_am_confused/

2024-09-30 10:36:48;Coffee is... destabilizing... how does it make you feel?;"I love the smell of coffee and its bitter taste but each time I realize that it seems to be destabilizing for me.

I am on lamotrigine, which is a mood stabilizer, and it seems to help me. I am not bipolar, my diagnosis is depression and OCD.

I haven't had coffee for some time, but recently I had a baby. I start to go for walks with a stroller and in order to have a goal for the walks, I started walking to Starbucks or Tim Hortons, so I started having coffee daily.
At first it actually made me feel better - I started to get excited about my mat leave, planning how I would soon go camping with the baby and do some serious hiking with with an infant carrier. My intrusive thoughts also reduced.

After about several weeks though I started to get anhedonia and it became very difficult for me to get out of the house with the stroller, and I didn't feel like it. Also I started to have more intrusive thoughts again, especially existential OCD type of thoughts.

I became quite concerned that lamotrigine stopped working but then I remembered that this has happened to me with coffee previously. When I start to drink it daily, the first days or weeks are pretty good, but then it's like I get a dopamine burn-out. Everything just starts to feel pointless, nothing to look forward to. Not sure what to do with my day as I just don't have a desire to do anything.

I'm glad I remembered this and stopped having coffee a few days ago. I've had just some green and black tea in the past few days, and felt better. Not sure what it is about coffee, but tea does not cause such a burn-out for me. 

A lot of research evidence shows that actually coffee is beneficial for women and women who consume multiple cups a day are less likely to experience depression. Seems that for me it's the opposite?

The coffee burn-out for me is even quite physical. It's as if I really lack dopamine - my speech slows down, I find it more difficult to even open my mouth and say something. It feel like typing a message is very energy consuming. Just moving my body feels to difficult.

Then my brain also starts lying to me. It kept saying that it's not the coffee, it's the postpartum hormones. But I forced myself to not drink coffee for several days now - and yep, it was the coffee.

2024-09-18 04:37:31;What else to try - lamotrigine;"I have been seeing psychiatrists and on various meds since 2015, so I just want to throw some ideas out there.
I have been on and off meds for 9 years and only half a year ago I was offered to try lamotrigine by my psychiatrist. I assume there are quite a few people who have never tried it.
I am a female, 30+ years old. I have been diagnosed with depression and OCD. I experience a lot of rumination and intrusive thoughts.

I have been on lamotrigine 50mg since March and so far it has been a positive experience for me. It has helped me with energy, I take it when I wake up. Also has helped me to have fewer ruminating thoughts about the universe being pointless, me not bringing value to humanity, fear of the future, all the very depressing stuff like that!
I tried going up to 75mg, but it actually made my intrusive thoughts worse, so I am back at 50mg.

Lamotrigine is not an SSRI, nor an SNRI. Lamotrigine is an anti-seizure med and a mood stabilizer.

What does it do? I was told it affects the way sodium ions flow into neurons. Why does that help me? My psychiatrist has no idea :D Potentially lamotrigine reduces neuronal activity, so it reduces the amount of rumination and anxious thoughts.
Also it maybe blocks calcium channels and by that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It may also have antioxidant properties.

Anyways, this is the only med that I am currently on. I haven't really had any side-effects and I find that I feel better when I take it in the morning on an empty stomach.
I also sometimes make saffron tea and use full spectrum CBD oil, but those are not meds, those are supplements.";r/depressionregimens;9;10;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/1fja53b/what_else_to_try_lamotrigine/

It did not feel holistic in the sense that they actually listened to my experiences to try and form an accurate diagnosis. I suspect I have some complex mix of depression, ADHD, and possibly anxiety.

I hear about psychiatrists who are willing to try more experimental treatments, such as MAOIs, TMS, and other non-SSRIs. So far I've tried prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, and zoloft, all to no avail.

Since I'm going to be paying out of pocket and could use care *immediately* to get my life on track, I don't want to have to waste my time and money hopping from psychiatrist to psychiatrist.

2023-12-14 04:34:01;"FAQ: ""The Recovery Model"" for mental illness";"###What is a Recovery Model for mental illness?

The Recovery Model represents a holistic and person-centered approach to understanding and supporting individuals experiencing mental health challenges. Rather than focusing solely on symptom reduction or the absence of illness, the recovery model emphasizes empowerment, hope, and the individual's ability to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life despite the presence of mental health issues.

Here are key principles and components of the Recovery Model:

Person-Centered Approach:

The recovery model is inherently person-centered, recognizing the uniqueness of each individual. It values the person's experiences, preferences, and strengths, encouraging collaborative decision-making between individuals and their mental health care providers.

Hope and Empowerment:

Central to the recovery model is the instillation of hope and empowerment. Individuals are encouraged to believe in their capacity for growth, change, and the possibility of leading a satisfying life. Empowerment involves recognizing and utilizing one's strengths and resources in the recovery journey.

Holistic Perspective:

The recovery model takes a holistic view of individuals, considering not only the management of symptoms but also broader aspects of their lives. This includes factors such as relationships, employment, education, housing, and overall well-being.

Collaboration and Partnerships:

Collaborative partnerships between individuals, their families, mental health professionals, and the community are emphasized. Shared decision-making and mutual respect in the therapeutic relationship are key components of the recovery model.

Self-Management and Responsibility:

Individuals are encouraged to actively participate in their own recovery and take responsibility for their well-being. This may involve developing self-management skills, setting personal goals, and making informed choices about treatment options.

Social Inclusion and Community Integration:

Social support and community integration are essential for recovery. The model recognizes the importance of meaningful connections, peer support, and involvement in community activities for promoting well-being.

Cultural Competence:

The recovery model acknowledges the cultural diversity of individuals and respects the influence of cultural factors on mental health. Cultural competence is integrated into the provision of services to ensure responsiveness to diverse needs.

Nonlinear and Individualized Process:

Recovery is seen as a nonlinear process with ups and downs. It is not defined by a specific endpoint or a predetermined set of criteria. Each person's journey is unique, and recovery goals are individualized based on personal values and aspirations.

Lived Experience and Peer Support:

The model recognizes the value of lived experience in understanding mental health challenges. Peer support, involving individuals with shared experiences, is often incorporated to provide empathy, understanding, and inspiration.

Wellness and Quality of Life:

The focus of the recovery model extends beyond symptom reduction to encompass overall wellness and the enhancement of an individual's quality of life. This includes attention to physical health, social connections, and a sense of purpose.

Implementing the recovery model requires a shift in the mindset of mental health systems, professionals, and communities to create environments that support and facilitate recovery-oriented practices. The model reflects a human rights perspective, emphasizing the dignity, autonomy, and potential for growth inherent in each person.

###What is the difference between the Recovery Model, and the Medical Model of mental illness?

Philosophy and Focus:

Recovery Model: The recovery model is rooted in a holistic and person-centered philosophy. It emphasizes the individual's potential for growth, self-determination, and the pursuit of a meaningful life despite the presence of mental health challenges. The focus is on empowerment, hope, and improving overall well-being.

Medical Model: The medical model views mental illnesses primarily as medical conditions that can be diagnosed and treated using standardized medical interventions. It tends to focus on symptom reduction and the restoration of normal functioning through medical and pharmacological interventions.

Definitions of ""Recovery"":

Recovery Model: In the recovery model, ""recovery"" is not necessarily synonymous with the absence of symptoms. It is a broader concept that includes personal growth, self-discovery, and the pursuit of life goals. Recovery may involve learning to manage symptoms effectively rather than eliminating them entirely.

Medical Model: In the medical model, ""recovery"" often refers to the reduction or elimination of symptoms, returning the individual to a state of health defined by the absence of illness.

Approach to Treatment:

Recovery Model: Treatment in the recovery model is collaborative, person-centered, and may include a variety of interventions beyond medication, such as counseling, peer support, and holistic approaches. The emphasis is on supporting the individual's agency in their own healing process.

Medical Model: Treatment in the medical model typically involves medical professionals prescribing medications to alleviate symptoms. The focus is often on symptom management and control, and the treatment plan is primarily determined by the healthcare provider.

Role of the Individual:

Recovery Model: Individuals are active participants in their recovery journey. The model recognizes the importance of self determination, personal responsibility, and the empowerment of individuals to set their own goals and make decisions about their treatment.

Medical Model: While patient input is considered in the medical model, there is often a more paternalistic approach where healthcare professionals play a central role in diagnosing and prescribing treatment.

View of Mental Health:

Recovery Model: The recovery model views mental health on a continuum, acknowledging that individuals can experience mental health challenges but still lead fulfilling lives. It values the whole person and considers various aspects of life beyond the symptoms.

Medical Model: The medical model sees mental health conditions as discrete disorders that require specific diagnoses and treatments. It tends to focus on categorizing and classifying symptoms into distinct disorders.

Long-Term Outlook:

Recovery Model: The recovery model supports the idea that individuals can continue to grow and thrive, even with ongoing mental health challenges. It does not necessarily view mental health conditions as chronic and irreversible.

Medical Model: The medical model may approach mental health conditions as chronic illnesses that require ongoing management and, in some cases, long-term medication.


###What countries implement the Recovery Model in their national mental health strategies?

United Kingdom:

The UK has been a pioneer in implementing the recovery model in mental health services. Initiatives such as the Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC) and the use of tools like the Recovery Star have been employed to promote a person-centered and recovery-focused approach.

Australia:

Australia has adopted the recovery model in mental health policies and services. The National Framework for Recovery-Oriented Mental Health Services is an example of Australia's commitment to integrating recovery principles into mental health care.

United States:

In the United States, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has been a key advocate for recovery-oriented approaches. The concept of recovery is embedded in various mental health programs and initiatives.

Canada:

Different provinces in Canada have integrated the recovery model into their mental health policies and programs. There is an increasing focus on empowering individuals and promoting their recovery journeys.

New Zealand:

New Zealand has embraced the recovery model in mental health, emphasizing community-based care, peer support, and individualized treatment plans. The country has made efforts to move away from a solely medical model to a more holistic and recovery-oriented approach.

Netherlands:

The Netherlands has implemented elements of the recovery model in its mental health services. There is an emphasis on collaborative and person-centered care, as well as the inclusion of individuals with lived experience in the planning and delivery of services.

Ireland:

Ireland has been working to incorporate recovery principles into mental health services. Initiatives focus on empowering individuals, fostering community support, and promoting a holistic understanding of mental health and well-being.

i've been going outside and taking walks, trying to engage in hobbies, trying to keep up exercise, making my bed every morning, retaking courses i need to build a successful life, applying to jobs, talking to people, doing therapy, eating healthy, for literal years.

and i'm more depressed than i've ever been. if anything, i'm more depressed with time.

every time i try to ""move forward"" by working or applying to a program, i feel like absolute garbage. i cannot do the work for the class anymore. i cannot write the paper anymore. focusing is not an issue, but every time i have more than one thing to do in a day i just crumble, if anything i get *more* depressed.

i feel absolutely horrible. trying to move forward feels horrible. trying to accept what happened feels the worst. this is not temporary. because i've felt this for several years now.

i wish i knew that failing my courses would trigger a depression that lasted for so long. once i identified depression i assumed with therapy and meds it would go away maybe in a year. but it's been like 4 years since diagnosed, 6 years since i've been feeling depressed and since i've started getting suicidal. i would've been so much more careful to not let myself fail.

i try not to ruminate. i try to force myself to be positive. i try to ""reframe"". i try to think it's not my fault.

all the while people talk like you can simply choose your thoughts. that it's just a matter of discipline. but when i'm not thinking of anything i feel absolutely horrible. when i try to move forward i don't want to do a thing. the application for the program i am applying for will be totally useless. i know at this point i won't get in. bc every time i have to do work for something, i feel twice as depressed. every time i commit to something, i feel like absolute dogshit. i can't physically/mentally put in work for anything anymore. it feels like, how the hell am i supposed to? i don't *want* to. this is not the shit i want to be doing. i wanted to be doing something else with my life. there's so much weighing down on me all the time, the thought of anything but doing nothing all day is just overwhelming to me.";r/depressionregimens;88;55;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/17o178i/i_dont_want_to_do_the_work_i_dont_even_know_what/

2022-06-19 11:31:10;I am no longer depressed nor existentially depressed. I am free.;"Note: First paragraph is an account of the various varieties of depression I dealt with; feel free to skip if you’re not up to it.   It is my hope that this account of a shamanic medicine experience helps others who are struggling with existential, treatment-resistant, complex or co-morbid depression. 

I have been dealing with existential depression, clinically diagnosed major depression, clinically diagnosed bipolar (only two manic episodes in the last 15 years however—it’s the lows I struggle with) and clinically diagnosed Seasonal Affect for most of my life (34yo). Bipolar and seasonal affect began around puberty, however. If you’ve read about C-PTSD (of which I am also a poster child, not to mention ADD, which also seems to be in remission now), you may have learned that early infant neglect can contribute to existential depression for people who weren’t touched, fed or cared for adequately in their first few months of life (my mother had postpartum depression and I was kept in a cardboard box, underweight, underfed, jaundiced and alone in case you’re wondering what that looks like). Depression accelerated in a violent, broken home. It got worse as I watched my father beat my mother weekly for the remaining six years of my time at home, beat and threaten my brother and I, and fail a violent suicide attempt, finally dying many years later, essentially from a death of despair, lonely and alone. 

All of this, well, depressing preamble is to say that I no longer consider myself any kind of depressed. 

Having tried well over a dozen different medications with no success, and undergone therapy on and off for 20 years (with very limited success), I was ready to kill myself at the end of this year. I quit my burnout job (software dev at a startup), cut off my hair, and left to travel for 7 months with the plan of killing myself if I couldn’t get rid of burnout and figure out how to live with more joy and lightness, and less existential dread and fear. 

I attended a weeklong Ayahuasca retreat in Peru, participating in 4 Ayahuasca ceremonies, including smoking Sonoran desert toad venom in a fifth ceremony. 

Within three days of the shamanic medicine ceremonies I considered myself recovered from a lifetime of otherwise untreatable depression of various varieties. 

I discovered some of my gifts. 

All my weapons-grade traumas—personal and generational—became some of my greatest assets. I was able to reframe them as dire and beautiful gifts in a personal narrative that is startlingly unique. I embraced my strangeness and saw its grace. 

I realized who and what I am, and it was the most life-affirming experience to finally be free of my past, not haunted and eaten alive by ravenous ghosts. I am a humanist, and I am free, rather than being suffocated by the cloying identity of a survivor of a terrible past. 

Upon smoking bufo venom, I connected to something that felt like the purest form of source-love-energy-information in the universe, from where we come, and to where we go, and I laid there laughing like a maniac with tears streaming down my face at the very thought of ever being alone and abandoned by the universe—I realized that my brief and wondrous life is an incredible gift. It was like speed-running 100 MDMA trips through a psychedelic pathway, without the mood hangover or side effects. 10 minutes was how long this experience lasted. I no longer felt alone and precarious in a dark and terrifying world. I was grateful to be part of the question the universe was asking itself—part of a grand and magnificent experiment in entropy. 

Bufo is used with great success to treat addiction, especially in a shamanic setting. I have never struggled with addiction, but it’s really shocking that I didn’t, considering how many addicts struggle with feeling alone in the universe, unseen and abandoned and unworthy of love, like I did. 

Ayahuasca, on the other hand, I’d call a powerful empathogenic nootropic. It activated my long-suppressed emotional intelligence and unlocked a synergy with my overcompensating intellectual intelligence, allowing me to process a lifetime of undigested emotional trauma. It was often difficult, but I was very much ready to let go of what wasn’t serving me, whatever it took. 

As a result I am lighter, more focused, more present, more accepting of myself and others, no longer caught in my past, more emotionally perceptive, less bothered by people or everyday annoyances, have a better memory (that was a feature of having more emotional depth to guide my intellect), and I embody my humanist values more fully with every passing day. My ADD seems to have calmed down now that I am not subject to the hypervigilance of unprocessed trauma/C-PTSD, and now that I can be more focused rather than haunted. My sleep has improved too. 

I completed the retreat a week ago and plan to do another retreat in a year or so, as there is even more work to be done, but I need to process and integrate for a while, and find my new equilibrium in daily practice before undergoing another retreat. 

The small section of shamanic medicine known as Ayahuasca ceremony has changed my life dramatically, and I wanted to share the experience here. 

Perhaps this will help someone else become free.

After nearly 16 years of having hypothyroidism (I'm 33 now and was diagnosed on the day of my 18th birthday). I have had problems with tiredness and depression since about 15, and nothing I have done has helped completely (apart from antidepressant which helped with the depression for a short time, with side effects, but not the fatigue).

Recently I accidentally discovered that not taking my medications (levothyroxine) made me feel MUCH better. I didn't even make the link at first because I simply assumed it's not possible, but after trying everything which could have caused the great mood on those few days, I tried skipping my thyroxine again, and again I felt better.

Btw, symptoms of hypothyroidism include tiredness and depression/anxiety as well as brain fog.

&#x200B;

After some research I found a few studies that showed that this was actually quite possible:

1. A study showing that the ratio of the two thyroid hormones in the blood FT4 and FT3, are correlated with quality of life. Doctors never look at this, and instead just ensure that your FT4 and FT3 are within the reference ranges, even is that means that your FT3 is at the bottom of the range and FT4 is at the top, which would be considered a very bad ratio according to the study and one which correlates with hypothyroid symptoms. So don't just accept from your doctor that everything is ok just because you in within the reference ranges.

[Health-related quality of life is reduced in treated primary hypothyroidism and with lower fT3/fT4-ratio](https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0037/ea0037EP927)

2) A study showing that a dose of levothyroxine (synthetic T4) increases blood levels of FT4 immediately upon taking, thus disturbing the FT3/FT4 ratio. Many doctors dont realise this happens because the half life of thyroxine is so long (about a week).

[Thyroid hormone levels affected by time of blood sampling in thyroxine-treated patients](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=thyroxine+time+of+day&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DJjIBXOEv8JcJ)

3) A study showing that skipping a dose of levothyroxine actually restores this ratio (which you would expect given study 2, but it's just prove that skipping a dose does help).

[Short-term withdrawal of levothyroxine, induced increase of thyroid-stimulating hormone and an increase ratio of triiodothyronine to thyroxine](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=170&q=ft4+ft3+conversion&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0rg4sT5BFdAJ)

&#x200B;

I then got my FT3 and FT4 tested to check the ratio, and low and behold it was slightly lower than the average of a hypothyroid patient (most patients are ok on levothyroxine only, with 5-10% still showing hypothyroid symptoms). FYI, the study shows that the average ratio of FT3/FT4 in non hypothyroid people is 0.34, in hypothyroid patients is 0.26 and my ratio was 0.246.

&#x200B;

I knew that some people take liothyronine (synthetic T3) as well as levothyroxine so I did some research and there is indeed a recent study showing that the subgroup of hypothyroid patients with the most symptoms do prefer and improve on a combination  of T3 + T4 compared to just T4 medication. Previous studies seemed to all lack this subgroup analysis and concluded that there was no benefit to adding T3 medication. But it looks like there is benefit for some patients, but that group is small enough that if you look at the overall averages only, there isn't a statistically significant amount of improvement.

This recent study is here: [Comparative Effectiveness of Levothyroxine, Desiccated Thyroid Extract, and Levothyroxine+Liothyronine in Hypothyroidism](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgab478/6311304)

&#x200B;

If you are not diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I think you should be suspicious if you FT3/FT4 ratio is very different from the average of 0.34, even if the doctor says it's fine because they are within range. My problems with fatigue started about 3 years before I was actually diagnosed. TSH, FT4 and FT3 were all within range for these years but I felt really tired and depressed (and was a very energetic child before this). I personally think before hypothyroidism gets bad enough for either FT4 or FT3 or TSH to go out of range, you can start getting symptoms because the ratio of these hormones starts becoming abnormal. I can't prove it, but my experience of feeling shit for a long time before I was diagnosed combined with new evidence which shows that the ratio of FT3/FT4 is important makes me think that just because FT4, FT3 and TSH are in range, it doesn't mean everything is ok.

&#x200B;

I actually looked into all this 14 years ago when I was 20. I started taking Armour which contains T3 (but in a different ratio with T4 than I currently take and which the human body makes), and I started feeling better although not completely. I then stopped mainly because I felt like I was part of a weird fringe group and I thought that mainstream medicine probably had the correct answer, and the benefits I felt were probably just placebo and I was probably just depressed.

Well 14 years later and I've been trying to fix my fatigue and depression this whole time. I've tried many things, and nothing gave me the results that adding T3 medication has given me. If it was just placebo, then I would have also had the same placebo affect with the other things I tried.

So far I've been taking it for 2 weeks and still feel great.

&#x200B;

Summary:

Get TSH, FT3 and FT4 tested (nearly all doctors will not test FT3, and some not even FT4). Check the ratio, and be suspicious if it is much lower than the average which is 0.34 and talk to your doctor about adding T3 to your thyroxine and show the study above if necessary. NICE guidelines state that the doctor can let you try T3 if other health conditions and different doses of thyroxine have been rules out.

You can also buy T3 online abroad without prescription which is what I had to do.

If you arent diagnosed with hypothyroidism but have low FT3/FT4 ratio then I don't really know what to suggest, but at least you know that this ratio could be a reason why you don't feel good. Again talk to your doctor and show the study above.";r/depressionregimens;80;16;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/oxz1i7/a_warning_to_look_into_your_thyroid_even_if_you/
2021-05-10 05:44:02;Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression?;I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now.

After my mom got us away from my abusive dad, she started struggling herself but never dealt with her issues. Instead she started drinking and taking pills. Everything caused her to lash out and a little thing I would do as a kid (like break a glass or cry for over spilt milk) would set her off. As I grew up it only got worse and worse and worse, from yelling and mental to physical- it doesn't mean she didn't have amazing mom moments, and I'm so grateful she got us away from my dad (although sometimes I wish she would have sooner). I always tried to pay her back and show her my love though, I knew she was struggling and I had a sense of what struggling was like. But my mental health was not up to par because of everything. It didn't help that she would fill my head with ""your problems are just kid problems, my problems are real adult problems"", ""I'm more stressed/depressed (list of everything she is going through)"", even my trips to mental hospitals and residentials she was telling me how much I was making her suffer through this. And I started getting angry and ""selfish"" but then she got diagnosed with cancer and I hated myself more. She survived without any chemo, just takes the pills. But now, I'm finally trying to cut her out of my life.... the guilt kills me. I really love her but she only makes me worse. She feeds into my cognitive distortions and calls me crazy for going to the mental hospital or therapy when I'm just trying not to kill myself because I see some sort of potential in me. She also gets crazier and crazier and I just can't stand it. 


I'm not allowed back home but I don't have a ""permanent"" address because the apartment complex I live at doesn't have mail boxes or mailing room, so I only have a po box. I have no choice (unless someone can help with ideas) but to put her address as my permanent. So all my mail and yes my stimmy checks go to her place. I'm basically forced to visit her and hear the guilt tripping.  Everytime I cry in the car because she makes me feel bad for existing. I was the reason why my dad started getting violent, I was the reason she had to leave, I am the reason she doesn't want to live, and I will never be as good as her. Everytime. I want it to stop. I am trying so hard to be my own person- I pay for my car in cash right off the lot, insurance, rent, phone, everything. But this emotional Rollercoaster is plating a part in me failing college. I'm on my second year and failing still, covid definitely didn't help. It sucks because I know I'm smart but I'm unmotivated because I feel so helpless. I'm trying, I promise. I'm trying as hard as I can and am can't help but to cry because of the pain I experience while having internal battles with myself to just survive a day or try to figure out what emotion I'm feeling. 

My mom went through a lot too and I know deep down instead she's not a bad mom because I cherish her good moments- so am I a horrible daughter for not dealing with her? She is my only parent afterall. 
Am I just a failure of a person because I can't deal with what life handed me?
Will this pain ever feel slightly better?
Will I ever just be better? Allow myself to have a good education, get a good job, and live a happy life.
I'm not asking for a 6 figure salary, a million dollar car/house..
I just want to be a little comfortable. I just want to be a little happy.

**Edit**: Wow. I never thought I would be hearing such nice words. Because of everyone being so comforting and kind to me, it made me want to be a little kinder to myself today- I got up and did some of those little tasks that seem difficult when you are down. So again, **thank you**. I never knew strangers could be so nice.";r/depressed;131;27;https://reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/mma2bp/if_you_end_up_reading_this_thank_you/

2021-02-08 13:50:52;I've discovered that two health problems were causing nearly all of my depression and anxiety and adhd and I feel so much better after fixing them. I'm amazed at all these years;"EDIT:
Since writing this I have realised that I felt good on these days not because of removing dust as this post mentions...but actually because I skipped my medication for hypothyroidism (levothyroxine) on these days also, completely coincidentally and by accident. I have left this post here however for two reasons:
1) there are many interesting studies which I mention which link allergies to depression and anxiety so reducing allergies may still help some people
2) as a record of how good I felt when I didn't take my levothyroxine, useful for anyone who also has hypothyroidism and takes thyroxine for it. It was quite remarkable how  much better I felt and I even wondered if I had biplar 2. Several people have also confirmed that they feel the same when they skip a dose in a separate post on reddit and again on another forum (including my Mum which she never told me about). There are studies which  show why skipping a dose coudl have made me feel betterI have since managed to get hold of Liothyronine aka T3 which I take alongside my levothyroxine and feel much better (which there is also evidence for, especially in a very recent study). I will post about all this in a new post.


Original post:

Tldr: being really strict with minimising dust mites (diagnosed dust mite allergy) has made me feel so good that I almost have too much energy and feel in a great mood all the time now. I feel like a different person honestly. And also avoiding gluten after noticing extreme tiredness, bad mood and stomach ache after eating a lot. Chemicals your body produces when you have allergies (cytokines) are linked to depression and anxiety.

Please get yourself allergy tested if you have any symptoms... 1 in 4 people have allergic rhinitis apparently.. And for gluten intolerance, please try doing a gluten free diet after testing for allergies (you won't notice the difference as much if you soon have an allergy which is making you feel shit)

I'm not sure if depression or fatigue can be the only symptom of allergy or not. I did have allergic rhinitis too which manifested as slightly constricted nose and diminished sense of smell.

I haven't felt like this since I was a kid and all my depression and anxiety has basically reduced substantially or even gone away completely.

I would be curious to see if anyone has a similar increase in every and mood after giving the house a good clean to remove allergens from their home. Please post on this thread if you try it, whether it worked or not.

RELATED STUDIES AT RHE BOTTOM

---------------------

I've had depression since I was 12, and anxiety. I've been on 6 different antidepressants and developed social anxiety disorder. I also had a lot of trouble concentrating at school and throughout my life, was diagnosed with adhd at 23 (I'm 33 now). And after trying exercise (which definitely helped a lot), meditation, eating well, having good sleep hygiene etc, I still found that it was hard to be in a good mood and I was tired all the time (I thought this was a symptom of the depression), and had often had a real struggle concentrating at work.

I'll cut to the chase... My problems were mostly due to dust mite allergy (diagnosed) and gluten (or maybe just wheat intolerance). After minimising dust mites in my bedroom and avoiding gluten, I feel so good that I wondered I might have bipolar and be hypomanic. But the improvement coincided so precisely with my efforts to minimise dust mites (basically in one day) that I think it must be that.

I have loads of energy, and I'm in a good mood all the time. I don't ruminate about things hardly at all. I feel like I've had a coffee when I haven't but without the anxiety I get with it (quit caffeine weeks ago). I haven't felt like this since I was about ten years old. I had so much energy after a workout that I wanted to run home, I'm never normally like that after a workout. I feel like I can think faster, focus better, have less social anxiety because of this improved focus and mood but maybe that's also directly related (allergies are linked to depression and anxiety I've recently discovered, probably in a chemical level due to cytokines). I can have 5 or 6 hours sleep and still concentrate the next day which I've never understood before how other people can do.

For the last 20 years I've looked at people who have a lot of energy and who are in a good mood all the time and right of them as so different from me, and I was jealous. I assumed they were genetically different in some way, like their brain was different, although looking back I was actually like that before the age of about 12. Now I feel like I am like that again. I am the one who is upbeat and bringing energy into the conversation, making peoole laugh and I can see that people really like my company. I feel like I have charisma, and feel so much more confident. I honestly feel like a different person.

I discovered it was this allergy because one day I decided to minimise dust mites after reading that there's a link with depression and allergies, and I was diagnosed with dust mite be allergy years ago because of finished sense of smellI washed my bedsheets at 60 (the temperature that kills dust mites) because oue cleaner washes them every two weeks on 40. I turned on my air purifier all day, hoovered my room with hepa filtered vacuum (cleaner only does this every two weeks too), opened my window all day, and the next day I felt great, could concentrate at work much better, was in a better mood, had loads of energy, after 3 months of feeling more and more shit. And this wasnt a small maybe placebo different, it was huge difference and has kept going. It's too pronounced to be placebo I think, plus it makes sense because of my diagnosis and the studies I've read.

The weeks and months before I had the dust mite cleanse, including the day before immediately before, I felt like shit. I was researching supplements online for my mood, was sleeping in the afternoon, moody all the time and was considering going back on antidepressants. My housemates were all worried about me. Two of them told me I need to see a doctor for mental health or tiredness.

Granted it's only been a week so far but I've never felt this good my whole adult life, and I noticed an immediate effect after spending a day minimising dustmites (I have been avoiding gluten mostly for weeks now too but didn't notice feel amazing just from that, even though I notice I feel pretty terrible when I eat gluten or maybe it's just wheat)

I was diagnosed with dust mite allergy about ten years ago but never realised it could make me so tired and moody. I don't sneeze, or have itchy eyes. Physically I have a bit of a stuffed nose a finished sense of smell and that was it. So I was never that strict with minimising dust mites because I didn't care that much about my stuffy nose. I was never told by the doctor about any of these symptoms, just was given a nasal spray which didn't really work.

I recommend anyone with depression or anxiety gets allergies tested. Dust my allergy affects one in six people. Please post your results here if you get tested.

The aftermath of this couldn’t be worse: I was born surrounded by poverty, I never had the life all the other kids did have, all my rights were constantly violated and my future looked gloomy. When I thought things couldn’t be worse, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type at 14, which made my hopes to have dignity practically disappear. I have never had the job of my dreams. I work all month long to earn a shitty salary. I always had to have the basic: basic clothes, basic mobiles, a basic car, ALL BASIC. It’s useless to work all month long just to survive. I never had a great car. Designer clothes ? HAHAHA only at stores mannequins. I’ve had the same car when I learned how to drive (2006). Basically all my money goes to the medicines to treat my mental illness. So this is my life. Unlike ppl love to say, LIFE IS NOT A GIFT. It may be for privileged cunts, but for ppl like me it is a punishment. I think about suicide every day, all the time. This is not what I want for me.

2020-11-23 00:46:11;Antidepressants start out well but then lead to out of control emotions, impeding doom and feelings of evil, intense nostalgia, crying spells and finally, suicidal ideation - a dangerous mixed bag. What to do?;"I've tried a few SSRI antidepressants and the result is always the same. I don't in the sligtest doubt that  in some way benefit from them, however the full picture of SSRI's effects on me is downright dangerous.

By my nature I'm apathetic and anhedonic and my world seems gray. First few days of antidepressant (up to second week) usually result in ""fog lifting"". I become more optimistic, less withdrawn, in way better spirits. There is warmth in the sun shining on my skin and appreciation of music and arts. Fantastic, no longer is everything a drab and I can start enjoying life! Then a weird sort of nostalgia creeps on me. Being for so long deprived of emotions, I start to ""appreciate"" the bad stuff from my past, I reminiscient of many things both good and bad in my past, finally experiencing some sort of emotion when thinking of these things.

But then everything starts to get out of whack. I cannot shut thoughts of ex-girlfriend, I miss my old town, I think of friends that I haven't talked to for so long due to my depression. It all becomes too much, emotions overwhelm me - good and bad. I get nightmares, things that I've done wrong start to haunt me, every little things that's ever happened in my life gets this huge significance. I go from euphoria of not being depressed, a sort of high almost, an ecstatic state, to this deeply disturbing sense of dread, an irrational dread, a dread of *something really bad that might happen*, yet I don't know what that is. That disturbs me even more. A sense of impending doom washes over me. I start fearing every waking moment, and I don't know why. At the same time I feel this great euphoria of not being depressed, and worrying fear. It's an awful mixed bag, so bad that I end up prefering being depressed-only, because this new state is intolerable. It feels like *insanity*. One day, hell, one moment *up*, the other moment *down*, the third moment - *both up and down and with terrible anxiety*! I start to be afraid of what the next day has in store for me.

I've just been through one of these ""episodes"" again. I was uplifted for 5 days but this morning I woke up and I felt the most depressed ever and everything has this *evil spin,* as if something is out there to get me. (Not in a literal sense, it's a feeling. You know when you watch a horror movie and you know it's a horror movie because even when things are funny, like in the beginning of the movie, there's always this *unsettling* feeling about it. It's like that.) This is clearly not good. I'm fully aware of what is going on, and that makes me scared, so scared that I don't want to try any more antidepressants. I'm afraid one time it will be *a one-way ticket only*.

So, while not denying that I am depressed in my regular state, or at least *something that looks like depressed*, how do I move to not-depressed and also not-unstable? Is there something I can suggest to my psychiatrist to avoid trying more drugs that will make me batshit crazy?

2020-11-12 12:27:59;Birthday coming soon and all it does is make me sad.;"So my 18th birthday is coming soon, my family is talking to me about plans and I am just trying not to burst into tears in-front of them.

All I can think about is how wonderful it was when I was a kid, and how I can never go back.

I remember when both my grandparents were still alive, it was always so exciting to get presents from them, I remember my grandma (dad’s side of the family) especially always got me these big bionicle sets which I loved to death when they were around. My grandpa I never got to spend too much time with, he died when I was quite young and there was a language barrier with my mom’s side of the family but we still communicated just fine, he loved me a ton and I remember how he built me all these wooden toys in his garage and drove my mom and I around in his van which he used to bring materials home. Unfortunately I don’t have much to remember him by, the toys he made I lost or they had rotten away in storage (they weren’t resistant to termites and mold) and his van was sold to buy a newer car. We have photos and that’s about it.

I remember my older brother when he used to live with us. He and I always had issues because my Aspergers (didn’t get diagnosed until way later) conflicted badly with his social nature, but he loved me so much, in fact the reason I exist is because he wanted a baby brother more than anything. Now, what must be 8 years or so of being apart, I lost my connection with him and my subconscious has classified him as a stranger and as such, I am uncomfortable talking to him.

I remember having birthday parties in the bowling alley and eating pizza and cake with my friends, I can still remember the taste of the Pizza, it was a little dry and chewy, but it was freshly baked and had a nice taste to it. I remember how I played with my friends in the little indoor jungle gym of the establishment. And of course, I remember how tired I was after the party and enjoyed a comfortable sleep in the car on the way home, back when I could actually damn sleep well.

Now... What is there? I no longer want things, I have a hard time being comfortable around other teenagers, two of my grandparents are dead, my brother living in another damn continent and I hardly have any of my possessions left to help me remember on the account of how many damn times my family has moved over the years, all the toy brands I loved have been long since discontinued, food no longer tastes the same. I can’t even fucking enjoy things on the account that I realize the day I die is approaching every second I breathe.

Anyway... I’m probably just gonna order some cake and maybe some pizza.

2020-08-22 04:07:14;Being depressed and having depression are different.;"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

2020-07-08 08:45:44;I Offer You a Success Story (Bupropion and Lamotrigine);"Disclaimer: this is a long anecdote about my depression more generally, but it places my current regimen into context and I thought some people might enjoy reading my story. Edited slightly from a post in /r/getting_over_it

I'm in my mid 30's. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when I was 21. I have a past filled with physical and emotional trauma. I tried to kill myself numerous times and wound up in the psych ward on 3 separate occasions between 21 and 26. I've been locked in a cell because I was deemed a danger to myself and others. I've struggled with drug addiction. Pretty much boiler plate shit for what a lot of us are dealing with.

When I was 26, I chose to check myself into the psych ward for the 3rd time. That was partly informed by the memory, still seared in my mind, of my whole immediate family standing around my hospital bed after I had almost died of a suicide attempt, bereft of words, wondering why. That experience taught me just how much power I have to devastate the people that care about me. I understand that some of you don't have those people and I'm grateful those anchors existed, as light and fragile as   they were. Salient in that moment was the idea that my life doesn't just belong to me. Even after that experience though, I kept drifting around for awhile, homeless, selling shit to cop drugs to cope with the new reality that suicide was no longer an option. Weirdly, when it felt like a viable option in my mind, I felt like I possessed some ultimate form of self-determination. I no longer had that thing to hold onto, so everything about my existence felt out of control. I had eviscerated all of my personal relationships by that time and my existence rose little further than basic survival.

I chose to check myself into a psych ward the last time because my experience in that hospital room haunted me and I felt my only choice was to start living my life again. Eight days later I was out and I had been prescribed a med that I thought was working for me - Wellbutrin 150mg. I shortly followed up with a Dr. when I got out of the hospital, eventually upping the dosage to 450mg a day. It certainly was no cure, but at least it helped me cut back on cigarettes and that small step alone helped build some momentum toward progress. Unfortunately, the struggle persisted for years, into and out of suicidality, on and off using, in and out of different living situations. I had at least made enough changes to convince someone to let me live with them while I found a job, which I did. Then I finished  my undergraduate degree. Then I started really running again. Then I went to grad school and got a masters degree with a 3.95 GPA. In spite of the additional student loan debt, achieving those things felt good. They were huge boosts to my self esteem and mental health at the time. I am sure Bupropion at least assisted in all that progress. Ultimately none of it mattered because I still felt existence was pain, I hated my life and I wanted to die.

I had known for a long time that if I was ever going to achieve something approximating mental stability, I was going to have to do work on a regular basis that felt meaningful to me in some way, so I became a teacher. People had been telling me for years that I would be good at it, but I knew it was a really hard profession with high burnout and people with psych issues tend to struggle. I resisted for awhile, but eventually relented. I think I realized that I wasn't going anywhere else with my life and I was tired of stagnating as a bicycle mechanic, so I got my M.A.T. in 2016 and started working as a full-time middle school teacher. Despite acknowledging the meaningful nature of the work I was doing, nothing seemed to pull me up in any significant way from a persistent state of anhedonia, at a minimum, oscillating to and from severe depression.

So I resolved to accept that my life was what it was. I had built up a pretty substantial cognitive tool box, out of pure necessity to help me cope with and survive the most difficult periods. I had accepted that happiness is simply not an emotional state that I get to experience. I had accepted that my life would continue to be a protracted series of battles between my conscious self and my brain chemistry and that sucked, but that was fine. I was fine. I had learned how to win those battles most of the time and I could deal with that. I had developed mental strength and resilience. I had an opportunity to do good in this world and in the grand scheme, I knew I was extremely lucky, despite never actually feeling that way.

Then something unexpected happened.

When I moved closer to work, I had to get a new primary care doctor. I found one I thought I would like and he turned out to be awesome. When we got my blood work back, he said that everything looked good, I was quite physically healthy. He then said, ""all we need to do now is get you mentally healthy."" A friend of his ran a psych practice not far from me and he seriously encouraged me to go talk to them. I told him my hesitation stemmed from only recently having found a place of relative stability and not wanting to upset that in any way. Exercise is the most effective anti-depressant I've ever experienced and I had achieved a decent fitness level that was totally keeping me afloat at that point, I didn't want to rock that boat. He was totally empathetic, though he felt the conversation was worth having.

I  found the very worst part of being treated for depression was putting my body through iterations of trying different psych meds, only to wean off and try something else when the first, second and third tries proved ineffective. You all know what I'm talking about. After about 10 years of trying and wreaking havoc on my body through each iteration, Bupropion seemed to be the only thing that had any marginal impact. I was convinced psych meds were little more than a key to unlock one's capacity to do the work to get better. I thought they were minimally helpful, but at least a springboard to progress. Granted, that was and is still highly significant, but I was disillusioned by the whole concept and frankly a little resentful by then for even having to take meds. Fortunately, I trusted my new doctor enough to make an appointment to see the psych. When they said I could maintain my regular Bupropion dose, while trying additional meds that weren't contraindicated, I figured it was worth a try. They prescribed me 25mg of Lamotrigine daily. I started taking it.

It  was about 10 days later when I started noticing unusual things happening in my brain. I would catch myself reacting differently to various events. I would find myself thinking differently about elements of my life. I would find myself taking more joy in the same shit I had been doing all along. I got my runners high back. I could finally, for the first time in my life, really sit back and look at the things I had achieved and appreciate how hard I had worked to get there. It was so obvious that it was working I hardly knew how to react. I stood in my kitchen one day crying because it hit me that it was (is) real... at first I couldn't believe it. I thought it could only be temporary, that I would build a tolerance and the effect would subside with time. For a few minutes I even questioned reality in toto. I felt like I was cheating. Then I realized the only thing happening was I was seizing control of my mind. Practically overnight, all those tools in my cognitive toolbox became 10 times more effective and 10 times less necessary.

The best way I can describe it is to say my emotional self-regulation and impulse control (so like most of what governs behavior) were dramatically improved. I'm not subject to my cognition anymore so much as experiencing it and analyzing it in real time. It's like my mind functions on a meta-cognitive level now. Rather than being subject to visceral states, I'm experiencing those visceral states in a cerebral way, thinking about what they mean and why I'm feeling them. There are moments and situations now that I can fully acknowledge would have been handled very differently in the past, and it makes me smile still every time I have that realization. It took me awhile to learn how to wield that new power, but it was a very fun exploration process.

The regimen remains 300mg Bupropion & 25mg Lamotrigine daily, exercise and eat well. That's all I have to do is live a healthy lifestyle. It's just my experience, but I found that the act of doing the work is the very thing that made me and still makes me feel better. By 'work' I mean the tedious and uncomfortable shit: getting up early to run, going to the therapist, being an honest practitioner of self-reflection, taking the time to cook decent food, keeping my physical environment clean and organized, that's the stuff that makes the biggest difference to me. It's also very likely what has made me a good teacher. Sure, it feels like work, but I get no greater sense of accomplishment than when I manifest appreciable progress toward getting my psycho-emotional shit under control. I've managed to achieve some pretty cool stuff in my life, but nothing compares to knowing my own hard work has quite literally improved the quality of my internal life. It just took a little pill to allow me to see that. I would have bet my entire net worth that I wouldn't have ever found a more effective med than Bupropion, and lo'... Your miracle could be right around the corner and that's why I want you to keep trying.

Maybe you don't need meds, maybe you just need to do the work to change destructive behavioral  patterns, I don't know. I know people reading this come from myriad backgrounds with infinitely  different lived experiences and it might not be very relatable to all, especially those who lack access to, or can't afford mental healthcare. I  acknowledge that my innate and societal privileges have put me in a greater position to tackle this shit than a lot of others. So if you take anything away from this, I suppose I want it to be that there is still hope, even when all feels lost.

Thanks for reading and I wish you the best on your journey.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm in my mid 30s having been treated for severe depression and suicidality since 21. I found Bupropion (300-450mg) to be mildly effective at unlocking my capacity to do the work to get better. Still struggling, a new doctor prescribed Lamotrigine (25mg) and it had a profound effect such that my emotional self-regulation and impulse control were greatly improved. Now, I'm more consistent in doing the tedious stuff that really makes a difference in how I'm feeling. I thought hope was lost. It wasn't. It's not.

2020-06-14 10:55:30;Thirty plus treatments for depression, no success;"I am 28-year-old Canadian man.  I desperately need some off-the-beaten-path treatment suggestions because *no* standard treatments have worked.  I have tried the following antidepressants from 2009-2020: Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Duloxetine, Mirtazapine, Duloxetine + Mirtazapine, Bupropion, Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine, Selegiline, Moclobemide, Nortriptyline, Nortriptyline + Lithium, Amitriptyline, Desipramine, Clomipramine, Venlafaxine, Valproic Acid.

None of these worked, except for phenelzine and tranylcypromine for about 1 month each before pooping out despite a large dosage.  Neither were tenable long-term treatments however because they caused severe insomnia.  The severe insomnia typically prevents me from taking antidepressants.

I have also tried a variety of other biological treatments.  These include, in chronological order... rTMS (one full course in 2015 in Toronto; two courses in my home city in 2016, to no effect); unilateral ECT in 2017 (two full courses, to excellent effect, but only lasting 3 weeks, and with maintenance treatments only lasting one week; autobiographical memory loss was very concerning--I can't really remember anything beyond a year ago); psilocybin in 2019 (small doses at home, up to 2.5g, but none to any effect); ketamine infusions in 2020 (twice a week, but no effect, neither during the ""trip"" nor in the days following).  I also tried the keto diet for almost 2 months in 2020.

I've also tried throughout the years CBD oil (2 weeks), light therapy (several months), triple chronotherapy (two different times, I stayed up 36 hours, used the light box), St. John's wort, omega-3 supplementation, and exercise regimens (both cardiovascular training and strength-training).

On top of the biological treatments, I've worked with about a dozen therapists (psychologists and psychiatrists) who have advocated for different schools of psychotherapy, and I've read some of the popular books for these psychotherapy schools including behavioral activation (this is mildly useful, but since I have severe anhedonia \[inability to experience interest, curiosity, pleasure, awe, etc.\], doing things almost always makes me feel even more miserable--double the misery when surrounded by people doing the activity and actually enjoying it), mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (I cannot figure out the purpose of meditation), cognitive behavioral therapy (the cognitive side of this was not applicable to me as I tend to, actually, not have negative destructive thinking patterns despite 13 years of chronic depression), and acceptance and commitment therapy (again, the mindfulness-related stuff seems pointless, and the behavioral-based stuff on taking value-driven action seems useful...but I cannot identify anything I value because of my severe anhedonia--basically you can't value things if you don't feel emotions).

I've also been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, so I've read a few Asperger's therapy books.  I don't relate very much to the Asperger's diagnosis, however, and I think most people view me as quirky or introverted, but not pathologically so.  So I haven't found the Asperger's self-help books very relevant.

The most impairing symptoms are (a) anhehonia (as I mentioned above), because it renders your leisure time a hellscape since you can't enjoy anything or relax and (b) concentration impairment (I had to drop out graduate school because I literally cannot read, and I also cannot hold down a job because I cannot concentrate enough to learn new skills, etc.)

Tough case.  My health care providers are out of ideas.  So I'm out of hope.  Willing to try basically anything that is left.  Even if it's not a treatment specifically indicated or researched for depression.

Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

2019-12-07 05:50:25;symptom free for over 90 days;"My backstory:

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and PTSD in my early 20s. I was hospitalized once for a depressive episode, and have been on various anti-depressants all throughout my adult life. May as well mention now, I'm a man in my late 30s living in the U.S., to provide some context. Each fall and winter has, historically, been a massive test of my sanity. No anti-depressant ever worked for very long.

Today, as I write this out, I am not taking any medications for depression or anxiety. I am symptom free, but it didn't happen overnight. If I told you how I live today, you would think ""I can't live like that, I don't have the energy."" Neither did I! I got to where I am incrementally, and all of the changes added up over time.

So I think my improvements started a couple of years ago, when a doctor tested my vitamin D levels. It was 19ng/dL (reference range is, I think 30ng/dL - 90ng/dL). Since then, I supplement 5000IU of vitamin D year-round. Over time, this helped clear up the brain fog and memory impairment I had been experiencing. 

Aside from the vitamin D, these are the changes that I have made that I feel have made a massive difference. None of this is exciting, or surprising, but I cannot understate the cumulative power of doing all of these things. It takes energy to live the way I do now, and that energy was cultivated over time. 

Meditation:  
This past summer, I started making a habit of daily meditation. My goal was 1 minute per day, because that was all I could stand. Over time, I have been able to work up to 20 minutes each day.  I have reached a point where I'm able to detach myself from the discomfort and boredom of sitting and focusing on my breath, making it possible to meditate for any length of time.  


Diet:  
I mostly gave up junk food, and try to skip a meal (usually lunch) on non-workout days. This is possible because I have a smoothie in the morning that is high in fiber & protein most days of the week. I try to make a point of feeling hungry for at least a few hours to help stimulate fat loss and autophagy. On workout days, I consume upwards of 5000 calories. (I weigh 180lbs and presently at 16% bodyfat.....but I started at about 24% bodyfat a couple of years back.  


Exercise:  
Exercise has become a part of my identity. It is an unnegotiable requirement. At my worst, I started out just trying to walk  at least 10,000 steps each day, and sometimes failed at that. I did it because walking helped relieve my anxiety. Eventually I started running short distances, and built up to running 20 miles per week. I sometimes bike when my knees need a rest. Running helped immensely when I had trouble with anxiety.  


I started out strength training with olympic weights and a power rack in my garage. I kept the weight low and cared more about being consistent than getting impressive numbers. As this became more habitual, I advanced to more difficult routines. My strength training went from 15 minutes 3 days per week to where I am at today: 90 minutes 4 days per week. Now you see why I need so many calories.   


Sleep:  
I take several supplements in the morning, as opposed to taking them at night for the simple reason that I try to avoid consuming too many liquids in the last 2 hours leading up to sleep. I keep my room as dark as possible AND use a sleep mask. The only supplement I take before going to sleep is melatonin. I can never seem to manage more than 7 hours of sleep, but always wake up feeling refreshed.  


Supplements:  
\* alpha-lipoic acid  
\* L-Carnitine  
\* Fish oil if I didn't have my morning smoothie (it has a alot of Omega-3s)  
\* 5000 IU vitamin D  
\* blueberry extract 1 gram (if i dont have my morning smoothie, which contains 1/3 cup blueberries)  


The only supplement I take that I think is important for me personally would be vitamin D.  I get most of what I need that other people might supplement via the smoothie.  


I'm not sure what's next in life, but my income potential has been going up because my brain just generally works better now.

2019-05-28 22:42:09;There is Healing in the Gym;"I've had chronic depression and anxiety since high school (about 14 years ago now, ugh, I feel old), and I've been to various psychiatrists and counselors, and even had a ridiculous mis-diagnosis of schizophrenia for a while. Creative coping mechanisms and a doctor who wouldn't hear me out....fun.   


A few years ago, I got on a medicine that actually worked for me, and found a way to start taking it regularly. I started feeling better consistently for the first time ever. Feeling hope was incredible. I finally understood why people said ""it gets better"".   


But I still had crashes. Bad ones, more often than I'd like, and I still felt stalked by my depression. I yo-yo dieted over and over. I had to live with knowing that if something bad happened, even if it was fairly small, I'd probably crash and be a rotting ball of self-loathing for a few days at least. I was capable of feeling well, but still not truly stable.   


Over this past winter, my husband and I started a steady diet and workout regime. I started making some really significant progress with my counselor, too. I did things I never would've thought possible- I could have a bad day, get in an argument, and NOT have a days long crash afterward. I could deal with something that sucked and upset me without internalizing it. I'd be grumpy, I might even slip into self-loathing, but it'd wear off after a few hours! HOURS!! Not weeks or days, just hours. I was stunned, I didn't know I was capable of that.   


But then some stuff got in the way. I got sick, we went on vacation, appointments were rescheduled to one of our normal gym days, and we stopped going to the gym regularly...then stopped going at all. Steadily, my depression worsened again. A single small incident put me in a depressive state for over a day, with lingering ""fragility"" the rest of the week. My self-care and hygiene has gone down the drain (hah, puns).   


I'm having to face the facts. I have never felt so good as when I was working out regularly. If I want to be my real self- the me that is bouncy and funny and happy and optimistic - then I NEED to work out. It's non-negotiable. No excuses, no exceptions, no second option. Medicine only gets me halfway. The rest, for me at least, is in eating well and working out.  


I've got my husband on board again. I've accepted that this is what I need to do. I'm going to claw my way back up until I can shake this specter off.

One day, an advertisement for Transmicranial Stimulation (TMS) came through my feed as a suggestion. I had never heard of it. None of the tons of doctors whose paths I had crossed ever mentioned it's existence. It is a series of treatments using MRI magnets to stimulate the dormant parts of the brain associated with depression.

 The magnets are placed above the head and stimulate the neurons during the treatment. I won't lie, the first few sessions hurt because even though the magnets don't touch your head the stimulus will cause a pecking sensation, kind of like your brain as the tree and the magnet as a woodpecker. It fires rapidly in succession and then gives 10 second breaks in between. I was desperate because I didn't feel like I could survive the pain within anymore so this was really nothing. You have to do the treatments Monday through Friday for the first few weeks before they space sessions further apart, so there is also the time commitment of 30-45 minutes per day. 

Halfway through the treatment, I still couldn't quite tell whether I was improving dramatically or not. But, about three quarters of the way through I was able to sleep at night and started to get out of bed willingly. At that point in my depression I was at a level 10, the absolute deepest I had ever been. I had also been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and pretty much spent three years barely functioning. I was in bed upwards of 16 hours plus per day. My life was nothing. I could barely care for my kids. Then, all of a sudden I was up and engaged. My family and friends began commenting on how good I looked and I was having clear, coherent conversations. I've lost 38 pounds because I have the energy to exercise. It really changed my life. The best part about it was that my insurance covered all but my normal copay. It is extremely expensive treatment, but if you have insurance it may be covered. 

I had a total of 36 treatments over the summer and insurance will pay for retreatment if I relapse. According to the doctors, most people do need retreatment at different rates. They estimated that the need varies between six months to three years depending upon the severity of a person's depression. I'm nine months out and still doing well. TMS therapy is approximately 12-15 years old (I can't remember exactly). 

Anyhow, I wanted to share my story in case someone here is in a position to research and consider it for themselves as an option. I'm sending positive vibes to anyone who reads this whether you consider TMS or not. If I can get better after 30 years of suffering anyone can.

Edit: even though my post was way too long, I neglected to mention that I have been reduced from five meds to two plus an optional sleep med. I now fall asleep on my own and only wake up maybe once or twice a night as opposed to every hour or sometimes going for up to three days without sleep. I changed to a healthier diet as well which was also a huge life improvement that I didn't have the energy to implement prior to treatment.";r/depressionregimens;88;27;https://reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/bi6iv6/tms_therapy_changed_my_life/
2019-04-25 18:34:40;Do you ever doubt the validity of your depression? And just think that the reason you can’t do normal things, is just because you’re a bad person?;"My depression has depression bro. A lot of the time I doubt that I have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. 
I hope this isn’t just me. Like deadass, I don’t know if I’m the only person who feels like this. And if I am that’s just gonna scare me.";r/depression;2460;166;https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bh71ld/do_you_ever_doubt_the_validity_of_your_depression/
2019-03-28 02:06:30;Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels;"Depression, and it’s synonym suppression are commonly used in medical treatment and diagnosis to indicate something is wrong and the affected system can’t adequately contribute to the rest of the body. So basically you can’t think and act in a way that keeps up with your obligations. So it’s not just feeling sadness. It’s not laziness, and it’s not for the sake of gaining attention. If some was experiencing respiratory depression. Would you say” ok but have you tried breathing more?” No? Then cynics and doubters can fuck off.  Ok. I’m done.

https://www.zocdoc.com/- a way to find therapists and psychs in your area who take your insurance

***
I just got my monthly flyer from my HMO (called HealthTalk). In this month's edition, they have a section on depression. To quote them, ""depression is a medical problem, like having diabetes or needing eyeglasses. It is nothing to be ashamed of..."" Yet their policy won't cover any hospitalization or in-patient treatment facility for mental health issues. Also, there is a set limit on psychiatry visits and no coverage for therapy visits (even though this flyer points out how crucial therapy is for recovery). So no, they do not treat mental health like diabetes, and certainly don't treat it like a medical issue requiring medical treatment. The kicker is the section is with a picture of smiling doctor in a lab coat with a stethoscope saying he's here to help- yet he is a medical doctor in a hospital or medical facility, not a psychiatrist (just a guess given the lab coat and stethoscope)- the exact people this insurance policy gives absolutely no coverage to see.

Please don’t ask me if I’m OK — my automatic answer will be yes. In reality, it’s a big no. You see, depression can make you feel ashamed.
...Please always keep an eye on me, but know no matter how many times you tell me I’m worth it I probably won’t believe it on cloudy days – but please never stop telling me. Ever....""

Are Antidepressants just “happy pills?”
No matter what their exact mode of action may be, it is clear that antidepressants are not “happy pills.” There is no street-market in antidepressants, for unlike “speed” which will improve the mood of almost everybody, antidepressants only improve the mood of depressed people. Also unlike the almost instant effects of speed, the mood-improving effects of antidepressants develop slowly over a number of weeks. “Speed” induces a highly artificial state, antidepressants cause the brain to slowly increase its production of naturally occurring neurotransmitters.
