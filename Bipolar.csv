2025-11-08 22:04:52;Side effects of meds;"I need advice, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and borderline personality disorder this March.
I have been taking Valproic Acid 500mg 1 a day since then, now this week I mentioned to my psychiatrist about my lows and how I'm really struggling with it alot. He has given me a nww medication Lithium Carbonate 450mg 2x a day, I feel alot more shitty since I started taking it. I feel so exhausted, my body wants to sleep and It's like i'm floating.
I have been having a hard time breathing as well. I don't feel anything at all. It's like i'm on antidepressants.

Is this normal? Should I be concerned? I feel so tired despite having good amount of sleep..

2025-11-08 21:49:07;Is it over?;"My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 5. He was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of years ago. Started therapy, got on meds. Things seemed to have been getting better, but he dropped a bomb on me a couple of days ago and said he no longer wants to be with me. 

For context, we are best friends and do everything together and we really get along for the most part. But when he’s manic, he becomes hyper sexual and fantasizes about being with other women. Honestly, that part doesn’t bother me. Who doesn’t think about sleeping with someone else once in a while when you’ve been together for so long? He tells me that he feels like it’s getting worse and that he can’t trust himself. He thinks he’s out of options and needs to leave. He hasn’t cheated on me before, we are very open with each other, but he thinks it might happen one day and he doesn’t want to hurt me. 

I don’t want him to leave. I want us to fight. But am I just fighting for something that’s already dead?";r/BipolarSOs;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1orpvgc/is_it_over/
2025-11-08 19:59:16;Question about Cyclothymia;I was diagnosed with cyclothymia this week. I’d never heard of it before, but after a good amount of research I don’t think I’ve ever felt so seen by a list of potential symptoms. I’ve also perused Reddit and other sources to hear about other people’s lived experiences with cyclothymia, and the big difference I’m noticing is that the highs and lows of other people seem to last days. Mine last hours. Until a few days ago I thought everyone experienced the full spectrum of human emotion in the span of a day or even a few hours. Does anyone else have cycles this quick? It’s exhausting. I feel like my entire sense of self is written in sand and the tide comes in 10 times a day. ;r/bipolar;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ornnh7/question_about_cyclothymia/
2025-11-08 18:05:36;MY GF doesn’t think she is BP1 (?);"Sorry to offload 💨 guys but seems like everyone on here is suffering from the same torment ❤️‍🩹
& I have no one around that understands the depth of this rubbish we put ourselves through…

I have read a lot on here regarding BP1 ….and it sounds the same as to what IV been through , 

episodes of mania , discard , things that don’t make sense in a normal relationship -

 my “ partner” believes she has been diagnosed wrongly (BP1) 

IV witnessed her talking about “snipers”/ hit men on roofs etc etc 
…
before her episode of PSYCHOsis (smoking /drinking / f*kn diff guys etc etc ) where she was then put in a mental home and diagnosed with BP1 …. 

When she came out 
I didn’t see her for 2/3 years 
Until she popped back up with our child ….to have sex with me and slowly introduce our child to me …

I discover :
She was given medication which she stopped due to it making her feel unwell/lifeless she seemed to be managing well but there is signs something isn’t right … (👁)

We tried to get back together 
And IV been discarded on/off since the begging of the year 
Some of the experiences she had when she left disgust me …

Anytime 
I bring up our/her past experience
(Stolen , burgled , slept w/ others to then run back to me (?!))
Etc I’m made the bad guy for clarifying how I felt or how she makes me feel 

& I’m tired of it , I can feel it draining my soul


Does anyone else have this … they don’t believe the have anything wrong “it’s just how their brain is wired” ….

She says it’s “adhd” and believes she has been diagnosed wrongly 

But sounds exactly like people on this forum ….

Any suggestions from past experience  ? Should I just hurry up & move country as this is going to be a never ending story ?

I would run , but we have a child together 🛣 even though I feel to pack my bag and leave everyday ..

So confused , just want to hear from you guys how you deal with this crap

2025-11-08 16:19:53;Family/friends won’t get it and maybe it’s time for me to move on;"Hi, I’m 26M and diagnosed last year though I’ve had problems stretching back to 2019.

I think I’ve been trying to get people close to me to understand me and all of the reasons I can’t do certain things or why I react a certain way or why I make decisions they wouldn’t or why their advice lacks perspective or why they can’t understand why I do what I do.

But maybe thats okay. I think I’ve been expecting too much from other people. They can’t possibly understand how hard it is to live with bipolar but thats okay. I now see that it is unreasonable to expect that from them since it is an unusual situation and one where the spectrum of the bipolar experience is wide and definitely not as black-and-white as it is on Mayo Clinic or whatever.

All that matters is that I know my own limits and those around me don’t require things to “make sense”. I’ll stick with those who will trust me when I explain something or give me the benefit of the doubt. If bipolar causes conflict, so be it. I’ll stick with those who can love me with all of the perceived “faults” I have due to bipolar. 

I can’t waste my mental energy feeling bad that someone doesn’t get it. It’s time to move on.";r/bipolar;4;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ork3l7/familyfriends_wont_get_it_and_maybe_its_time_for/
2025-11-08 16:05:20;I got advice from a friend to check out this subreddit;"Aloha,

A little bit about my story I was diagnosed when I was 21 on a trip to Vegas (I’m from Canada) and it was a whirlwind.
The diagnosis was tough to wrestle with initially because upon coming home I was committed to the psychiatric ward and of course I was a hurricane there, but once the meds started to kick in I decided to read to the pamphlet on bipolar and like fuck I guess this adds up.
They put me on lithium initially and was stable for a while but as what goes up must come down with all manic episodes I felt very depressed and numb. I lived this way for a while until I went to a review board with my psych doctor and decided to go off my meds.
Give or take it took about a year of substance abuse and overall shenanigans until I became manic again and this time I decided that enough was enough and if I’m gonna be medicated its gonna be on my terms, I fought for the least amount of treatable dose of meds to still feel like myself and not loose my “spark” so to speak. Ive been stable on the meds for a while ever since then (around 2017?) but have struggled with addiction since then as I know due to my ailment I love this comfortable chaos that I’ve grown accustomed to. 
There was a period of 9 months of sobriety woven in there and let me tell you as someone with bipolar I never felt more stable in my life, I faced many challenges that would of crippled my prior self and even though the medication can’t eliminate all aspects of bipolar its given me the stability to have a regular job and friends and relationships.
I don’t know if this story will help anyone but it does get better and if anyone is afraid of losing their “spark” it can be there through diligence and the right concoction of meds, were all wired differently but as in all relationships communication is key, whether that be friends, family or in this case chemicals and my brain.

2025-11-08 15:49:01;Hallucinating while hypomanic;"Hello everybody. I started an antidepressant almost two weeks ago and I think it has activated me too much and I'm hypomanic. I am technically diagnosed schizoaffective but my former diagnosis for 8 years was bipolar 2 and I identify a lot with it. Apart from the antidepressant I take latuda 40mg and it has taken very good care of my psychosis.

Until now. I am hallucinating again, it's not constant and it's very mild (my hallucinations have always been mild) and I know they are hallucinations but they are there. And I'm also getting paranoid again. Especially at night when I'm at bed too wired to fall asleep but I'm kinda tired from the day, I will start to think that there's a creature in my room listening to my thoughts. 

I don't know man. I feel amazing apart from this. Haven't had this much energy in years (I'm way more prone to depression than to hypomania and my hypomanias never last more than a week). I feel invincible. I love the high. But I don't love hallucinating. I'm not doing anything risky or impulsive tho.

Is it worrisome? Is it normal to hallucinate during hypomania?";r/BipolarReddit;3;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1orjlwh/hallucinating_while_hypomanic/
2025-11-08 15:30:31;Does this get better with time?;"I’m now 21 and since I was 14 I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar.
The heaviest period was from 14-18 and after that I kinda found my way around it. UNTIL NOW, I almost never felt this depressed in my life. I have been gradually getting more negative thoughts and rumination for the past 2 months and now I’m having frequent suicidal thoughts. I have gone into this self sabotage mode where I ditched any good habit that I had and replaced it with a bad one. There are some factors that I think played a role in this. Like the fact that I had to flee my country due to persecution and retake college from the beginning in another country. And the fact that I feel like I can’t continue with my field of study because it has been bringing me a lot of stress and I don’t do well with stress. But I am afraid of taking any decisions because I am not in a stable state now.
Honestly I have been having this fear of not being able to succeed in life or sustain a job after I graduate (which has been delayed by three years at this case) and that is because the instability of my mood and my decisions. Does this get any better with time?

2025-11-08 14:21:00;Diagnosis;I was diagnosed with bipolar two years ago, I am now unsure if I have it because I don't know if I actually experienced mania during my episode. I think if it was mania, since then I have only experienced hypomania and depression but not full-blown mania. Either that, or the episode I had was a one off psychotic-like state due to trauma and any mental struggles afterwards is just due to trauma. It's confusing and since I still live at home with my family they don't want me to get on meds so I would just like to hear from others and their experiences to see if I can get a better picture.;r/bipolar;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ori5lp/diagnosis/
2025-11-08 14:18:21;I feel like I have forgotten how to be social.;"There was a time when I was social and confident. I could talk to anyone, fit in anywhere and never overthink what to say. I’m still confident in many ways but when it comes to being social, something just doesn’t click anymore.

It didn’t happen overnight. Until I was about 14, things were fine. Then slowly, I started feeling out of place. I didn’t fit in with my old friends and even when I tried changing circles, nothing changed. I was still the one getting ignored, left behind or just… unseen.

Now I’m in college. I have friends but my social skills are practically dead. Conversations feel forced and no matter how much I try by working on my body language, confidence or tone it just doesn’t feel right. Even around my family, I feel disconnected and have no idea what to do in social situations.

The thing is, I know I wasn’t always like this and that gives me hope. I’ve been diagnosed with a few mental disorders, so I understand why things ended up this way. But I don’t want to stay like this forever. I don’t need to be friends with everyone, I just want to be able to communicate like a normal person again.

2025-11-08 13:26:23;What do I do;"So some background I’m diagnosed with depression which I didn’t believe I had even before I suspected bipolar(for a lot of reasons I won’t bother listing), my dad has schizoaffective and my whole family on both sides has a lot of mental health illnesses and disorders and last time I told my psych the ssri I was on (lexapro) made me feel extremely euphoric she basically said I wasn’t accustomed to happiness?? 
Since then I’ve been put on Zoloft which was awful and now I’m “on” pristiq which was honestly the worst one so far so i got to a point  where I just had to be done bc I was cycling so fast and I quit mostly cold turkey (don’t recommend) about a month ago when I not only couldn’t get an appointment but also was not given a plan to stop it or change meds and now I’m unmediated almost 100% misdiagnosed (no matter which mental illness/disorder it is) and idk if I should tell my psych I haven’t been taking my meds at my next appointment 
I’m a minor and I honestly don’t even know if my psych was ever told of what my dad has bc my parents are divorced and my mom is kinda set on me not having something like him whatever she’s basing that on and my psychiatrist cares more about my mothers perceptions than mine so I don’t really feel comfortable asking for a reassessment of my diagnosis and if I say something I may just end up being forced to take some other medication in the future with no way out of it so maybe I just tough it out unmediated for the next year but it’s sucked so far less than when I was in meds but still shit

During my recent visit with my psychiatrist, after going through a long, severe depressive episode and medication changes that have drastically improved my mood (literally night and day), we talked about the symptoms that are still impairing my ability to function and she was like “um how has no one ever diagnosed you with ADHD?” Again no mention that i *dont* have BD. It felt insanely validating but at the same time, could my bipolar just have been ADHD this whole time? Can you have both?

2025-11-08 10:51:05;Bipolar in college;"I’m at a loss. I was diagnosed with bipolar my second semester of college shortly after I turned 18. I was studying civil engineering and I barely got through two years then took a gap year to work on myself and my mental health. and now I’m studying computer engineering at a community school. I really would like to transfer to a bigger school the one I have in mind has a very low acceptance rate and I’m about to flunk or barely pass a class again. 

Is college doable if you’re bipolar?

I’ll think I’m doing okay then all the sudden I’m really not and then I’m on the top of the world then I’m not again. I was on meds that were working well for me for a while but now they’re not.

2025-11-08 10:46:16;Misdiagnosed with bipolar! A cautionary tale, that may connect to 1 person.;"So I don’t know what tag this would fall under.. But for 3 years I’ve had a bipolar diagnosis. When I got diagnosed I felt relief as I finally had a name for something that had influenced my life. As time went on I started acknowledging symptoms I had tried to shove down, not talk about, and a feeling of something feels off. My “manic episodes”included a lot of emotional amnesia, probably actual amnesia too but how would I know lol. 

Many therapist sessions, psychiatrist appointments, CSA psychological evaluation, 12 whole months of processing hell later. I received a diagnosis of DID. Due to my bipolar symptoms aligning more with DID and rigorous assessments bipolar has actually been removed/revoked. Things really make sense now. No I was not looking for a DID diagnosis, I was actually terrified of that even being a potential. I am writing this incase just one person feels like there’s something more. I am being very vague in this post for privacy reasons but if this brings up something for you, be curious, or not!. 

this DID diagnosis has been harder to face in every regard. It means coming to term with how traumatised i was, I’m not saying that to dismiss others trauma but it’s just how it presented and manifested for me. I’ve still gained so much from this journey and sub.

Edit: I am aware both can coexist by the way, that’s just not my personal experience. ";r/bipolar;25;9;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ore3jq/misdiagnosed_with_bipolar_a_cautionary_tale_that/

2025-11-08 10:28:59;Should I get a second opinion on if I have bipolar?;"I’m beginning to doubt my placement on the bipolar spectrum. I wasn’t actually diagnosed with bipolar 2, rather, it was decided that I have enough traits of it that I should be on antipsychotics. My therapist actually recommended that I get more extensive testing

I’ve had occasional “episodes” but they were always a little odd. Usually, I’m depressed or mad with myself. In the time before I was medicated, every month or so, I’d have a few days where I’d pick up a new interest, usually invest a little money into it, and ultimately fall off of it when I realized that only I really cared.

I had a few “bad” episodes where I was literally sitting in bed at like 1 in the morning laughing and crying at the same time, believing I was some kind of covert psychopathic empty monster of some kind who deceived everyone. Where I’d do extremely attention-seeking things and I’d have a ton of energy that usually manifested in me acting in ways that my friends mostly found funny (I left them concerned sometimes). These episodes got worse AFTER I started considering that I might have bipolar, which is scary to me. 

The antipsychotics have mostly cleared my mind of most of the impulses and emotional states that got me hurt, but they’ve destroyed parts of me I loved having. I used to put all my passion behind creative projects and now all I can do is think about how I’m always destined to screw it up by getting too ambitious. 

I’m beginning to wonder if the weird capriciousness is just explainable by my preexisting ADD, and if the moodiness and depression are a result of my loneliness and total lack of direction in life. I’m certainly doing better on the meds, but I have to wonder if it was just placebo. It’s strange because going on them genuinely felt like a soft reset on my life. I swear that the way I see the world is literally slightly different now. But I’m still depressed and weighed down, and it’s starting to get to the point where I’ve had so many bad tiring days in a row that all the exhaustion is just building up and something is bound to break. Maybe I was just depressed? But that certainly doesn’t explain my “episodes.”";r/bipolar2;2;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ordqz8/should_i_get_a_second_opinion_on_if_i_have_bipolar/

I’m currently going through a depressive episode where i very much do not want to leave my bed and the amount of times i’ve called out of work and school is…not good. Because when I do have to go to work or school, I just dread it so much, and I feel so angry at everything. I can’t control it. I feel angry and upset and i’ve cried in class/the bathroom plenty times. 

I feel like because of my feelings, i take anger out on the people i love. I don’t want to do this to the people I love, but at times I feel as though I can’t trust anyone. I don’t know why. At times I feel like everyone hates me, even though there’s evidence clearly stating not. My emotions just overtake me and then i feel guilty, try to plan out the next day for myself to start over and boom i call out of school. 

I do not know which part of me this comes from. I am medicated on seroquel, but honestly it doesn’t seem like it’s kicked in yet. It’s probably still too early, i’m assuming.

2025-11-08 08:05:00;Bipolar or ADHD?;"This is purely a shout into the abyss.
But any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I am 25F in England and since I was 19 I’ve had the suspicion that I might be bipolar. My long term partner of 5 years took the words out of my mouth one time telling me they think I have bipolar, which shocked me because Id looked into it and hadn’t experienced a manic episode that I could recall. My closest friends have also noticed something might be up that’s not just standard depression. 

But now I’m 25 and every year without fail I’ll be hit with the worst depression that takes everything good in my life and turns it to hell. But for a few months a year I’ll be doing okay. I have many projects on the go and I’m the one who always gets it over the finish line when everyone else gets overwhelmed with the stress. It doesn’t impact me at all, I can do my day job - at one point I was working three jobs at once managing large events. I don’t stop, I’m excited , locked in, full of ideas and completely motivated. But without fail I come crashing down. And boy has it come crashing down again! My friends are sick of me, (I must give them whiplash!) I don’t leave the house, I hate when my housemate has people over, I can’t eat even a single meal and I hate everything I used to enjoy - I’d go on but it’s text book depression.

The kick is I got so fed up last year that I contacted my GP and spoke to the mental health nurse there. She told me they’ve been told not to refer people to psychiatrists unless it’s urgent and suggested we look into ADHD, which I’m certain I have but they wouldn’t even assess me because my mental health was too high of a risk so I ended up at square one. She also suggested therapy and antidepressants. I have private therapy twice a month and take SNRIs everyday.

I’ve gotten back on there books but was told by the NURSE not to tick the box that puts me in a high risk catergory. Now I’m scared if I tell them again that I’m concerned this will affect my ability to get an ADHD assessment. But what if I’m wrong and it’s just in medicated ADHD … perhaps it’s both. I feel like I look around me and my friends that suffer with MH issues are taken so seriously and given referrals/medications when I have been disregarded. I’m a smiley polite people please and I don’t think it works in my favour even when I say ‘Hey I can’t stop thinking about how much I want to quit life’. But im also a young black woman so maybe it’s that. I just know I can’t go on like this. I am sick of suffering and I feel like I should just be able to get on with it but I can’t and no one is taking me seriously or seems at all concerned.

TLDR; I don’t want to fuck up my ADHD diagnosis on the off chance I have bipolar. How do I know the difference? What made people think they had Bipolar? How quickly can I get help on the NHS? The system is fucked, is there any point? Will I regret trying again and be forced to jump through hoops that make everything worse? What do mild manic episodes look like?

2025-11-08 05:31:23;I think I have bipolar 2 along with my cptsd diagnosis - might ask psych about it;"Symptoms began around age 16. Before that, I was generally high-achieving and emotionally intense, but things shifted sharply in adolescence. Around this time, I began behaving in ways that felt driven more by internal urgency than conscious choice. I impulsively broke up with a long-term girlfriend, began sleeping around, cheating on partners, taking opioids and weed, sneaking out, and meeting adults while lying about my age. I formed very intense feelings for people very quickly.

My sleep became irregular: some days I would come home from school and immediately sleep for hours, while other periods I would barely sleep at all and still feel wired. I also began taking sudden risks without thinking them through.

At around 16–17, I took LSD on a whim at a party with people I barely knew. I had an overwhelmingly terrifying trip that I couldn’t psychologically “come back” from for months. Afterward, I became deeply anxious, dissociated, and convinced I was losing touch with reality. I would ask people to prove that events had really happened, including having others send pictures of the room where the LSD trip occurred to reassure myself I wasn’t still there. I was constantly checking whether I was “still me” or whether reality was real.

Eventually that specific panic state lifted somewhat, but anxiety remained, especially in the context of a very abusive home environment. Across the next several years, I experienced a recurring seasonal emotional pattern: winters were heavy and melancholy, while spring brought an overwhelming agitation and anxiety that felt unbearable. I also experienced periods where old memories and shame from that initial panic period resurfaced intensely, almost like I was reliving them instead of remembering them. And then, suddenly, the episodes would lift and I would feel normal again.

At 18, I met a girl online. Within a month of meeting in person at college, she moved in with me, and we married six months later. The intensity of the connection felt overpowering and certain. We eventually divorced, and later I formed another intense attachment and married again, though now I am genuinely happy in my current marriage.

In adulthood, the emotional cycling continued. Sometimes I enter periods of intense motivation, clarity, and drive: I start major projects, shift career paths, or pursue new identities with conviction. For example, despite having a stable career in software engineering, I recently enrolled in nursing school after deciding suddenly that I needed to change careers. I have started businesses, enrolled in a master’s program, and taken on ambitious projects, but when my state shifts, I lose all ability to continue them. They stop feeling possible, or even real.

During the anxious/mixed phases, I experience:
	•	Constant bodily panic
	•	A full-body sense of dread and impending doom
	•	Depersonalization/derealization where my surroundings feel unfamiliar
	•	A conviction that I am “going crazy” or reliving past trauma
	•	Difficulty recognizing myself or trusting my perceptions

No amount of logic or grounding shifts it. Hydroxyzine, propranolol, and Prozac do not touch it. Klonopin sometimes helps, but only partially and the sensations feel deeper than thoughts, like my entire nervous system is locked in terror. Then, sometimes overnight, it stops. And when it does, I cannot access the fear anymore or remember why it felt so real.

When the pressure lifts, I often move into the opposite state: I become energized, confident, sexually driven, and creative. I feel intensely connected to life and to people again. I feel more like my “true self.” My libido increases sharply, not only toward my partner but in general. I become socially outgoing and start planning or pursuing major life changes.

This cycle of intense drive and certainty → overwhelming panic and derealization → collapse → sudden return to “normal” has repeated in various forms since I was a kid.

2025-11-08 05:07:05;Slipping into depression;"Im 18, was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 when I was 17 in April after a really chaotic and destructive manic episode. 5 admissions to psychwards since march and countless 24-72 hour stays at CPEP (New York thing) and I didn’t even graduate with my class or go to prom because I went to rehab after getting myself addicted to cocaine. 

Well I lived a lot, met a lot of people and had some relationships with girls there, got into legal trouble. But since that chaotic rush died down I’m left more alone and lost than I ever have been in my life. I was set to go to the army but now I can’t. I now have self harm scars and stitches all over my arm and a mildly fucked up nose from using cocaine, no money left and my car totaled. Well whatever, Its been over a month since my last psychward visit and in August (right after getting back from rehab hundreds of miles away) I was suicidal and self harming, now I’m slipping back into this state of numbness and inability to act. Not eating, not brushing my teeth because it physically hurts, fucked up sleep. 

I have one chance at consciousness and existence and I’m wasting it in self pity and misery. And the worst part is is that I’m aware I’m wasting precious time doing nothing and isolating myself (although I really have nobody left in my life other than my mother and my younger sisters I was supposed to be a good role model too) I was back in the gym and eating well last month, in nature and spiritually connected, now I just feel trapped under ice and totally numb. Sorry for the spew of information and my story isn’t special. I’ve been tested for bipolar 1 three times (wasn’t convinced I had it) and every single time I was told I had it, all professionals say I have it. I thought of it as something that gave me deeper insight on pain but I fucking hate it, it makes existence feel unbearable and it’s not edgy or cool.";r/bipolar;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1or6bhb/slipping_into_depression/
2025-11-08 04:30:35;I think I might have Bipolar 2 — What signs help you recognise an episode?;"Hey everyone,

I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection lately and I’m starting to wonder if I might have Bipolar 2. I’ve noticed these waves where I feel *so* different from my usual self — sometimes I’m super productive, social, barely need sleep, and ideas are constantly flowing. Other times, I crash hard — zero motivation, sleeping too much, avoiding people, and feeling hopeless for no clear reason.

I know the internet isn’t a diagnosis (and I’m planning to talk to a professional), but I’d love to hear from those of you who *have* been diagnosed:

* How did you first realize you were experiencing **hypomania** rather than just a “good mood” or “high energy phase”?
* What kinds of **patterns** or warning signs helped you recognize when you were slipping into a **depressive episode**?
* Are there any **subtle signs** you wish you’d noticed earlier?
* How do you personally track or manage your mood swings?

I’m not looking for medical advice — just trying to understand what these experiences actually look and feel like from people who’ve lived it.

2025-11-08 04:26:09;Triggers;"Anyone else triggered by other people just in general? 

I’m having a hard time socializing and being around another people for this reason…and I’m not quite sure why that is. I think it’s because it makes me reflect back on myself and the things that I don’t have (which is literally everything a 36 year old woman should have - career, own house/apartment, boyfriend) I’ve apparently made horrible decision in my life to not set myself up with a career and I’m working what people would consider dead end jobs at my age and it’s embarrassing and traumatizing while other women have stable careers, etc. This puts me behind other women in a lot of ways and every time I think about it it makes me want to throw up. 

I wasn’t diagnosed until a year and a half ago, I do have a bachelors degree but apparently it wasn’t in anything lucrative or smart which I went back to school to obtain at 28 and I blew my one shot. It just honestly feels like I just haven’t done “life” right in any shape way or form and it’s really disheartening to see other women so successful in their life choices and even though this should “motivate” me it does the exact opposite and clams me up into a shell. 

It feels like all the guys I meet do drugs…cocaine and adderall seemingly the big ones which are hard NOs for me. These same women with careers are snorting lines with them and “having fun” and it makes me feel like something is wrong with me for not doing the same thing. How are they able to do that stuff and go home and lay their heads on their pillows and feel good about themselves? Oh yeah, they have careers and their own apartments so they feel good about themselves in the end. Somehow these women win and I don’t get it. 


Two I’ve met are respiratory therapist and nurse..they are somehow better? I’m angry and I don’t know why? Odds are I wouldn’t want to be with a guy who is attracted to a woman who uses cocaine…but for some reason these women still aggravate me and they fit the stereotypical persona of the “look at me” cocaine user attitude. Why are all of these people snorting drugs and having sex/talking about it? Am I really missing out by not having had this experience in life? It also bothers me that people say “oh it’s okay that they do it, they’re still functioning members of society” because they have a “title” but I don’t get the same respect because I choose to not do it and I don’t have a “title”? 

It’s fucked up and society is fucked. Are there still people out there who value things like senses of humor and loyalty in a person? It feels like all anyone concentrates on anymore is who has more money and who does what drugs….at age 36. ";r/bipolar2;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1or59z7/triggers/
2025-11-08 04:23:27;Does insomnia eventually turn into “decreased need for sleep”?;"I’m newly diagnosed and I need help on the topic of sleep and changing sleep patterns. I’ve been in a really deep depressive episode for a while now and I’ve been over-sleeping. I’m super tired all the time. But now ever since a week ago, I’ve developed insomnia all of a sudden. I go to sleep only to wake up an hour later and lay in bed the whole time. Then I go to sleep again, and the cycle just repeats itself. It’s extremely broken up sleep. I’ve also started waking up much later in the mornings now because I’m super tired from lack of proper sleep. 

Can insomnia spiral into “decreased need for sleep”? Should I be keeping an eye on the insomnia or is it not really too concerning? I’m only asking because usually bad sleep is an indicator of getting towards a manic state. I’m obviously not manic right now, but I do need to be aware of any sort of warning signs so I can take care of it right away. I don’t have any sleeping medication besides Xanax right now.

2025-11-08 03:33:35;Internal Mania—Anyone Else Experience This?;"As the title says, I’m wondering if anyone else experiences a more internal form of mania.

I didn't show the typical outward signs—like rapid speech or spilling out all my thoughts. I did display some extreme agitation. My most recent episode (which was the first one officially documented, though I’ve felt this way for most of my adult life) was a mixed episode that lasted on and off for what felt like months.

From the outside, I think people mostly saw depression. But internally, my mind was constantly racing. I was getting to sleep fine, but at night I would wake up after four hours and not be able to get back to sleep. I would just lay in my bed wide awake with my thoughts racing. I was also having frequent arguments with my wife, I didn’t think I was showing many symptoms. I was deeply suicidal at times, convinced everyone would be better off without me. Other times, I felt euphoric and invincible—like I was on top of the world. I started to write a ""novel."" I was having uncontrollable sexual fantasies.  I knew something was wrong, but I couldn’t pull myself out of it. I was scared to ask for help. I couldn’t function. I became obsessed with pouring all these messed-up thoughts into AI chats. Which is the last place I should have gone. It allowed me to go further down the mixed state rabbit hole and only made it worse. I was doing this for weeks. It felt like my mind was on fire and I couldn't control it.

This all started when I brought it up to my primary care doctor. I went to him to get a psych referral after finding out most of the psychiatrists in my area wanted a referral. He thought it was just depression, so he prescribed Lexapro. That’s when everything spiraled.

Eventually, my wife discovered those AI chats, and things took a serious downturn. I finally got in to see a psychiatrist, got a proper diagnosis, and was prescribed an antipsychotic along with a mood stabilizer/anticonvulsant.

I’m still processing everything, but I’m curious—has anyone else experienced mania that’s mostly internal?

2025-11-08 01:50:07;Now that I have ADHD Meds..I am wondering if I have bipolar 2;"Hey everyone,

So I recently (finally) got diagnosed with ADHD and started medication. At first, I thought everything was falling into place — focus improved, motivation came back, I was actually *getting things done* for once. It felt amazing.

But now that the initial excitement has worn off, I’m starting to notice some patterns that don’t quite fit ADHD alone. I’ve been having these weird mood swings — not like full manic episodes, but these stretches where I feel super “up.” My thoughts race, I barely sleep, I get really talkative and impulsive, and then I crash hard. The lows are brutal — I can’t function, I isolate, and everything feels pointless.

It’s not the first time this has happened either. Looking back, I can see cycles — bursts of energy and creativity, then weeks of exhaustion and self-doubt. I just never connected the dots until now.

Now I’m wondering if this might actually be **Bipolar 2** and not just ADHD mood stuff. The overlap between the two is *so confusing*. I’ve read that stimulants can sometimes make hypomanic symptoms more noticeable, which honestly makes sense with what I’m experiencing.

Has anyone else been through this — getting treated for ADHD only to realize there might be Bipolar 2 going on too? How did you figure it out, and what helped you find the right treatment balance?

I’m not self-diagnosing, just trying to make sense of things before my next psych appointment. Any advice or personal stories would mean a lot.

The PIP mentions my office attendance (I’d work from home the days I was in a depressive episode), meeting deadlines, and improving business results. I will say that honestly I’d do extremely well during my mania, and missed deadlines during my depressive episodes. They are also upset at my abrupt exit and my other team members having to pick up the slack upon my FMLA departure. Coming back I finally feel like I’m capable. I’ve been with the company 4 years now and this was the first time my illness impeded on my work this negatively.

2025-11-07 23:27:29;Im worried I wont be able to start my life;"Bipolar 1 w/psychotic features 19F

I was diagnosed this year a couple days after my 19th birthday. I was probably just half a week after a month long manic episode. I was EXTREMELY spent emotionally, but i had about $900 left in my savings ($2000 were spent in mania) and i used that to get my diagnosis.

Before I'd thought that i had a head start in life--and i kind of did. I went to college early and when i was a 'senior' I was halfways done with my sophomore year of college. I had a 3.5 GPA that id worked very hard to get. I was in a lot of clubs (not necessarily because i wanted to but my mom forced me) and I was captain of my schools varsity equestrian team since i was a sophomore.

During this time thought my symptoms started ramping up. it was manageable at first, not really affecting my schoolwork (yet) and mostly just my relationships with my family.

I was a bit naive, I wasnt to sure of what i wanted to do to make money. id always known that im just not someone to have a boss. I have no motivation when it comes to just being a cog in someone elses dream. I liked to paint, and im great at writing..but i just didnt know how to get into those doors.

  
Now living after my manic episode..im traumatized. I can take the depression even though when i go low i go really really low. but theres something about the mirage of mania. you just cant really see clearly, and that drop off after when your just totally depleted. All hope and all joy just gets snatched from you. Im usually never 'just' manic either. its usually mixed with hallucinations and strong delusions.

here's one delusion i still ache over: So ive always been someone who wanted to have a kid. I mean ive been writing journals since I was 13 because ive always been someone who struggled with these deep emotions (COUGH bipolar) and I wanted them to know how i navigated them at that time. 

A couple months ago i was in a slight hypomanic state. i get really triggered by caffeine and i was working on breaking that addiction because i thought it fueled my creativity (it doesnt). Anyway i was hypomanic and i grabbed these gold leafed tarot cards i bought when i was manic. started pulling blah blah blah. next thing you know i have the whole rest of my life planned out based on tarot cards and my birth chart. 

I thought at 20 i was supposed to meet this guy and we were going to have a son and I would raise him by myself. I thought i was going to inherit my grandma's house (even though it was molded and my mom was taking her name off the deed), become a famous writer blah blah..then take my own (you know, i dont want to get censored) at 50 when my son was 27. then at that time id have so much crap written that my son could inherit my estate and sell off my unpublished books and be set for life.

  
NOW THOUGH..I am broke..dead broke. I am depressed, havent been to work in 2 weeks. I've been skipping some classes for MONTHS even though im on campus. I dont even want to be in college id much rather be self studying and setting up my own income. i want to meet new people and involve myself in the art world. I want to try so many things but i just feel trapped. im trapped with neglectful parents who dont want anything to do with my diagnosis. my mom goes at literally ANYTHING i say. she got mad at me for starting her car to defrost just two days, she threatened to hit my last night because i took 0.2 seconds to stand up and go make dinner..

Idk.. when I read the symptoms of manic episodes online (specifically hypomania) they all fit well into my situation including sometimes a crash.. but like I said I haven’t been heavily depressed since getting off birth control and my crashes feel more like anxiety and regret rather than lack of will to live. It’s even tricker that when I tell close friends about my diagnosis they seem confused and don’t believe that I have it because I seem to be so contained — I guess I just want to know if people have had the same experience of feeling like you’re the only one that can see your behavior for what it is while everyone else around just thinks you’re normal and just anxious/antsy sometimes.

2025-11-07 20:31:20;Diagnostic;"How did you know you were bipolar? How was the diagnosis and how did you receive it? 

Wrongly diagnosed as depressed for 10 years. I decided to go to HP at the start of the year for ids. I was prescribed venlafaxine in addition to mirtazapine (for a disorder that was not stabilized because it was not diagnosed) 
2 weeks after my release I started having 2 suicidal attacks per week. After a month with terrible side effects (headaches, IDs, sleep paralysis, night sweats and horrible nightmares, paradoxical anxiety, etc.), I asked to stop taking venlafaxine. 
The idea was mentioned by my psychologist who found it strange that after several treatments, some of which were combined, I always fell back. 
I asked to stop the venlafaxine, the horrible withdrawal began. 
I did a lot of research on this disease that I knew nothing about. And it was a revelation for me, it was absolutely obvious. 
I spoke about it to my psychiatrist who refused everything outright and told me about persistent depression (she had known me for 2 months and never tried to find out about my past and family history, traumas, etc. Our conversations were just ""how are you?"" ""Very bad"" ""oh, ok, here are your medications, see you next month"") 
I had to put together a whole file of my experience with my traumas, the potential phases and she realized it. 
I am still in withdrawal (venlafaxine worst medication for me), I oscillate between mixed phase and hypomania for several weeks. 
I'm having a really bad year, I clearly almost died because of the HP psychiatrist who didn't listen to me and didn't look into the diagnosis but I'm so relieved by this diagnosis, it makes so much more sense than depression. 
For years I have been convinced that I was crazy, and that depression was certainly present but did not explain everything. Now I feel at peace about it. It's almost a blessing (not the illness but to finally know it) for me, I can act on it and not just feel crazy.
On the other hand, with venlafaxine + mirtazapine, I am clearly on fire and the illness has never been so violent. I have had a lot of self-control and this is hell, I'm aggressive, irritable, I talk too much all the time, I spend all my money on random things, I have boundless energy as if I was on coke 24 hours a day, an impulsiveness that I've never had, the urge to break everything all the time, to hit people.  I had that but much less marked before, and not constantly.

My psych switched me to Paxil and im on it for 2+ months but I have hardly noticed improvement rly...I was suggesting her to try Lamotrigine with the Paxil, as Im not sure what my issue is, but also because I suspect an overaccess of Glutamate from all the anxiety/stress im enduring(feeling tense, body sensations).

She wrote it down but said the interaction with Paxil is uncertain and she wouldnt add it if im 100% sure im a bipolar case, and off label it rather helps only with depression.

I was disappointed as Ive read dozens of people in different subreddits being on that combination, also for derealization(which I have too).

I was wondering if anyone here is on this certain combination, or if not maybe on a similar one I could change to/would maybe help.

The safety for the future shattered, the fact that I cant even say anything about how much it hurts because im safe and free from hospital and they are being ""tortured"" and ""held against their will"".

 My partner has been away visiting her family for 5 weeks and I’ve started to present signs of hypomania. Not sleeping much, spending more, talking more etc.

And she has started becoming more worried. But it makes her upset because she said it’s really hard to live with me when I’m like this. I’ve tried to explain things aren’t bad like before I was on medication but she still gets annoyed and upset. She said bipolar 2 is not just about me that it affects her living with me too.

i had suddenly gotten the idea to make a full indie video game myself and i learned a bunch of new software, designed a bunch of assets and characters, even planned out the timeline for the project and wrote a ton of lore for the story i was thinking up. i was going to bed at like 4 am and waking up at ~9 am for several weeks. it seriously felt like my god given purpose and i was certain i would make it happen. but the motivation and intense confidence i was feeling fizzled out like less than a month later and i don’t feel nearly as wired anymore. i don’t feel depressed exactly, but im sleeping a lot more than i was. although my mood isn’t amazing, it’s not consistently depressed, and i’m surprised about that.

2025-11-07 14:03:00;Finally certain that I have bipolar 2 (ADHD comorbid);"I'm 27 and I've been diagnosed with depression and ADHD since I was a teenager, but for the past couple of years I've been on and off wondering whether my depression was actually misdiagnosed, and for the first time tonight I think I can say for certain it is.

For years I've been questioning because ADHD and depression when comorbid made it much harder to tell if I actually have hypomanic episodes or if I was just hyperfocusing or happened to not be as depressed sometimes or whatever. My mom has type 2 bipolar which is what clocked me onto it, but every time I've brought it up with her (even before I was seriously questioning, as early as when I was a teenager once or twice after my depression diagnosis) she was insistent that I didn't have it.

Today, for the first time, I happened to think of it in the middle of a hypomanic episode and it really just could not be more obvious. It's like I have this well of nervous happy energy in my chest and I've spent the past hours happily chatting with old friends I haven't talked to in ages and I genuinely can't help but feel hopeful about things once.

No diagnosis, but fuck. When it's obvious it's obvious, huh. I'm too up to feel any kind of stressed about it right now but it feels like everything has clicked into place finally, like I can hopefully understand my brain properly now. It'll probably be pretty heavy (or maybe just relieving, god knows) when I crash. Guess I'm just trying to say, nice to meet you guys, I'll probably be around from now on.

They've had a rough time the past few months and are going through a breakup rn. We've been hanging out a lot lately and they are seeming less depressed (which, coupled with other things, is leading me to believe they are manic rn) but I don't know how to be supportive without enabling bad habits. Like a few days ago they wanted a tattoo and it's something we've talked about before so I thought ""hell yeah let's get you a tattoo"". It's super cute btw. They also have always been an impulsive person especially with hair. So we dyed their hair yesterday. 

I'm seeing some of the light come back but I'm worried that it's not sustainable and I don't know how to be helpful when they get depressed. We talk about anything and everything so I'm not like scared to talk to them or trying to avoid talking about hard things, but I know that sometimes it's annoying to always have to tell someone what you need. It's also annoying to feel infantilized so that's the last thnng I want to do. 

They live at home rn and their family are angels so the normal cleaning, cooking, showering etc. isn't something I'm worried about with depression but I still want to be helpful. Are there any small things that would help? Nice unspoken stuff that will lighten their load?

2025-11-07 10:41:16;On antipsychotic for the first time and I’m terrified.;"I grew up as a perfectly healthy and happy kid. When I turned 18 shit hit the fan real quick (I’ve talked about it a lot before in this sub: military, diagnosed at 19 while active duty, used to be a runner and now I can’t run at all). I don’t know how to be disabled. I went from perfect health to Bipolar 1, anxiety, PTSD, sexual trauma, night terrors, and a half working hip with chronic pain. I already have a tough time taking my mood stabilizers and now I’ve just been put on an antipsychotic. I saw this coming as my sleep has worsened from the paranoia (from PTSD) but I was still afraid. 

I’m 21 now but I still just don’t know how to handle all of this. It all happened at once and now it’s just getting worse. I’m working really hard in therapy and with my psychiatrist and doing my homework outside of my appointments. I have family that loves me and has been supporting me along the way. 

It’s just too much to handle. But I can’t just check out. I have no choice but to try and accept that these are my battles and it’s going to be a life long struggle.

2025-11-07 09:43:46;I can’t get life insurance because I’m bipolar.;"
I’m 23 in a single Mom to a 4 year old. Every time I try to get life insurance I get denied because we have shorter lifespan and are suicidal. Either that or I would have to pay some insane premium I can’t afford. All I literally want to do is get my son life insurance in case something happens to me. That’s not suicide related. 

I just want to fit in with the rest of society. I feel like an outsider. I’m a human too but I’m treated like a ticking time bomb. 

I have my mental health under control, I’m on medication and in therapy - overall my mental health usually feels great. It took me a long time to get to where I’m at, and I’m proud of myself if no one else isn’t. 

Everywhere I go I face stigma, judgment, ridicule, and denial. Everyone treats me like I’m an inconvenience or a burden once I tell them I have bipolar, before that they would treat me normally. I don’t know why my diagnosis magically changes the trajectory of things.

My diagnosis does not define me. It is just what I deal with, not who I am. 

I am lucky that the few people in my life are very supportive and understanding, very gracious. I would never take them for granted. 

It’s so hard for me to feel like a normal person and society due to the rejection I receive and the stigma behind it. I just want to fit in and feel normal. 

It makes me cry, because I deserve to be treated equally too. It’s not my fault that I have this diagnosis.

But the one thing I love is that my child sees me as the most perfect person ever. No flaws whatsoever. If that’s not unconditional love I don’t know what is, and he reminds me every day that I can fit in too, I can be normal, I can have healthy relationships and live a good quality life. He is the only person that makes me feel normal. 

Yes, living with bipolar is one hell of a ride and I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t take determination to deal with it instead of rotting away in your mental. But I worked hard for this quality of life I’m at now. 

I just wish people had faith and trust in me, I wish they didn’t feel like they have to watch me over their shoulders, as if I’m gonna do something unpredictable or rash at any given moment. I’m fully capable and self-aware of what I do and the consequences behind it, so me being irrational or unpredictable was never an issue. Everyone around me lives their life in fear like I’m just gonna disappear tomorrow, but the thing is, I’m not I love my life and I would never take it away from myself or my son. 

I don’t know where I’m getting at with this post. I guess I just needed to get some feelings off my chest. I’m going to go give myself the biggest hug, remind myself I’m worthy enough, and go get in my favorite pajamas and drink my favorite tea. I love me, and I will always remind myself of that.

Bipolar is not who I am, it’s what I deal with. 

Please treat me like a human too. 

And fuck life insurance policies, I’m more likely to die from a car crash or something crazy than suicide. My son deserves to have a safety net. I’m sorry I failed you, Zy. Mommy will do whatever it takes to make sure you’re stable when I leave Earth inevitably. We will figure out something to make sure you’re taken care of. I have no plans on leaving you anytime soon, I’m in it for the long run - I promised I would be there for you for life and I meant that. Fuck bipolar, I’m going to get up every day and keep kicking its ass. I’ll be damned if I succumb due to my own self, not in this life.

2025-11-07 07:56:54;Feeling incredibly lost.;Hi all. Just needing to vent. I (34M) am bipolar 2 (diagnosed 3 years ago) unemployed, my EI has run out, trying to stay sober, my wife has recently separated from me after leaving for a couple months, has her own apt now, and I am left with all the bills we usually split. Feeling incredibly devoid of hope, as her thinking was I need to get a job and work on sobriety more (I don't often drink but when I did it was usually in a hypomanic state which led to arguments etc.) but she doesn't really understand bipolar, or has made a massive effort to. Her leaving the way that she did, and ending things over text of all things, debilitated me. I was scared of not finding work before my EI ran out, and after she left, It was even more of a struggle to find work. The walls are closing in. We are seeing a councilor to maybe salvage our marriage, but the thought of being with someone after 12 years (3 in a marriage) and them not knowing if they want to stay with me is pushing me away. My support system and stability has taken a massive blow, and she does not seem to understand the incredible impact her actions have had towards me. I know it is hard to live with someone with bipolar, but I feel like she is leaving because she realized I may not be reliable enough to give her everything she wants in life and bailed on me. I'm distraught most days, trying to keep from drowning but am so lost on where to begin, can't afford anything as I only have $15 to my name, and am running on fumes. All the while she was able to land a new job, get an apartment, and go on 3 separate trips to her families cabin during our time apart.

the amount of times i’ve been told by my last psychiatrist “i have the same studies as a surgeon dont expect me to solve that” about SYMPTOMS and “i can only prescribe shit and see what works”, it genuinely made me lose all hope.

so i stopped medication for a year and half ( after being diagnosed with cyclothymia) but my episodes have gotten worse, so my therapist pushed me to try meds again, recommended me this psychiatrist saying he’s really good and basically hyped him up and man did he live up to the hype

i’ve never felt so listened and understood by a doctor before, he was so patient and helpful in navigating every single symptom i had making sure he got everything . he was careful to avoid any meds i took in the past and didnt help and any meds that would give side effects i complained about. 

he diagnosed me with bipolar 2 and he did it so idk gracefully??? idek what’s the word

i was in fact scared that my diagnosis  is gonna be switched to bp2 because to me that would mean a degradation in my mental health. but i walked out of that office so hopeful about everything. i haven’t started taking the meds he prescribed yet but for the first time i’m genuinely looking forward to it.

2025-11-07 04:59:00;Is being manic ALWAYS a bad thing? Can we use mania to our advantage?;"I've lived my diagnosed life (nearly 3 years) seeking stability and some form of normalcy. 

I have achieved it more or less. Its been nearly 2 years since I slipped into depressive or manic states. I would become hypomanic (maybe) and a bit dissociative but otherwise pretty darn stable. 

I recently had a few things that triggered hypomania and I feel the manic tendencies creeping back into my life..... My thing is   


My life is so mundane compared to what it was before. And that isnt bad! I recognize that...but a part of me wonders if this is how I want to live for the rest of my life? I feel like I WANT to be manic again because even thought I am stable I don't feel 'happy'. I dont genuinely feel the emotions that lead to the thought ""oh my god I am so happy and I love the life I am living"". And while a part of me knows that feeling I used to get was euphoric manic bliss, idk. I find myself really missing it. I miss LOVING life.... 

And now that I am slipping back into mania I wonder - is my life always going to be this battle of realities? Like, is being manic really THAT bad? Is there ANY way I can control my actions when I'm manic? (from experience its a no) But is there ANYONE out there who has felt like they could control where they put their manic energy ? Is being manic ALWAYS a bad thing? 

I feel so out of touch with myself... is this just my life forever? Is this what the disorder does? Will I just never have full control?

I am taking the medication, and have ceased drinking alcohol. However, this weekend I would like to be able to have at least a couple drinks while up there. I have had two nights that I had one shot of vodka in a mocktail, and one night that I had one beer. I was fine in both of those situations, but I would like to at least feel a buzz and get a second drink in me. I am quite big, so I assume that I could handle a second drink, but I have also toyed with the notion of having 2 drinks, but not taking my medication the night that I had the two drinks.

.

.
.
.

This year has been quite the year, with lots of positives throughout. Hard changes that were mentally taxing, but ultimately great in the end. Just a sprinkle of tragedy at the beginning of the year. I’ve mostly been experiencing my “ups and downs” as periods of stability followed by hypomanic episodes, followed by more stability. The depressive episodes haven’t been very present. Well, 2025 isn’t going down without a fight I suppose. 

My mom was diagnosed with cancer last month and is doing okay but it’s still scary; my father died from it when I was young and hearing my mom say that her tumor was cancerous stopped my heart. My grandma has severely declined in the past 3 weeks and is now in hospice with days to live. My personal insecurities are at a high and work stress is putting me over the edge. Suddenly I feel like I’ve been hit by a freight train and all I can do is cry about my insecurities and/or sleep. I’m really irritable and any kind of touch, interrogation, or loud noise sets me OFF. I am repulsed by everything and everyone.

I’ve been thinking about therapy again but I work with dogs, who are great listeners and kind of have to be a captive audience anyway. Plus I get paid to talk to them. Work is killing me but is my only escape from reality rn; hard to be depressed when I have 40+ pups to cuddle on any given day! But it’s been a minute since I’ve felt this bad and I don’t know how to carry myself.

2025-11-07 01:07:40;Discard during manic episode, avoidant attachment and how to process all this;"Hi everyone, I am on day 9 after my BF of 2,5 years dumped me in a way I could have never imagined. He is long diagnosed with depression but got the diagnose bipolar only a few weeks back, along with new medication. 
I was happy he saw that new psychiatrist, we had a fantastic holiday just before, he had his times where he needed space and I was very understanding with it. 

We were both working for my own company, which also gave him the freedom to have his „off“ days and all in all I would have said everything is going in the right direction. 

Then last week Monday he all of a sudden disappeared from work and when I found hon sleeping at home, he was super agitated and aggressive. He would not use my nickname anymore, told me to grow up and leave him alone and doesnt care about anything anymore. He blocked every attempt to talk about whats actually wrong. 

The next day he showed up to work, still super angry at me but hyper friendly towards clients. At home he avoided me further until a begged him to have a talk as I still didnt know what was going on and how to deal with all the upcoming clients. He shouted at me aggressively (which he never did before), blamed me for stuff thats not even true, blackmailing me into paying him 6 months salary and ironically joking about how I am his saviour and the best person ever. 
In fact I supported him through rehab, supported him (and his daughter) financially, gave him a home… all out of love… which I thought he also had for me. 

Now I am sitting here, questioning out whole relationship, crying for the loss and the good times and his support, grieving the home we had which he left in absolute chaos and struggling how to keep on with the company. 

I couldnt recognize him anymore. He hugged me when I said goodbye…thats when I felt the old warmth.. and this made it even worse.
I assume he took a weird mix of old and new meds, mixed with cannabis. 

How did you guys handle it? There is no real reason to hate him as it is his illness or is he a POS and I am just maling excuses for him? My heart still loves him and wants him to reach out and is worried about him trying to harm himself. My brain and my friends say I should just forget about him… but I just cant.

2025-11-07 00:19:08;How can I manage my emotions?;"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II when I was 18, and I just turned 20 this year. When I was 19, I was taking an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, but I decided to stop even though my doctor advised me to continue. Instead, I’ve been trying to manage on my own through art therapy, exercise, and by creating a more peaceful environment at home with my mom’s help.

I stopped taking my medications not only because I started gaining weight and felt very anxious about it, but also because they were expensive and my mom was struggling to afford them. Since then, I’ve been having a hard time managing my emotions — especially with my boyfriend of 3 years. He’s noticed that I get irritated easily and that I often say hurtful things like “you’re so dumb” or “you’re so useless.” I’ve also done things I’m not proud of, like pinching, kicking, or hitting him when I get overwhelmed.

What hurts me the most is that I wasn’t like this during the first year of our relationship — I used to be calm, affectionate, and patient. Now, I feel like I easily explode even over small things that aren’t really a big deal. It’s like I can’t control how strong my emotions get, and it’s affecting both of us.

I really want to change and learn how to manage my emotions better. I’m trying my best through art, exercise, and mindfulness, but it’s still hard. I’d really appreciate any advice or experiences from others who’ve been through something similar — especially on how to control emotional outbursts and handle relationships while dealing with Bipolar II.";r/bipolar;1;6;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oq3a8c/how_can_i_manage_my_emotions/
2025-11-06 23:54:39;Really upsetting diagnosis experience. (25f) AIO?;"Hi everyone! For context I started therapy for the first time in my life and met with a very nice lady who did an initial consult for an hour. For the past 10 years i’ve been having “episodes” that have destroyed so much of my life and I was ready to make change.

This was a dual therapist/psychiatrist and after telling her what’s been going on she decided that our next appointment would be to assess me for bipolar disorder. Keep in mind I know nothing about bipolar or mania and it was very heavy hearing that I might have that. Nonetheless, I was very happy to be finally getting treatment.

For the next 2 weeks before the assessment, I ended up having a very big “episode” where I was euphoric, acting very strange, not sleeping or eating, having endless energy, talking so fast to anyone I came across, hugging strangers, starting 4 new hobbies and spending all my money. I documented all of this because even though I felt on top of the world, I knew I wasn’t acting like myself. I eventually came down from this episode and became very depressed and exhausted.

I was so excited to meet with my psychiatrist again and tell her everything that had happened. I even practiced what I would say and was ready to get a diagnosis. I still didn’t know what was going on with me but figured she’d explain it all. I was ready for my assessment and so happy I had someone who cares to help me and educate me on my brain.

When I got there she shook my hand and said “nice to meet you, what can I help you with?”. I was taken back. I said “Oh well we actually met before” and she said “No, i’ve never met with you”. It wasn’t til she pulled up my file that she realized.

She didn’t apologize but instead started asking me the same intake questions as before. I then reminded her we were supposed to be assessing me and that I documented everything for her.

She then said “Oh yes I remember you” and asked me to read her what I documented. When I did she said “Yes sounds like mania and bipolar, i’m going to put you on meds and a treatment plan”.

She then kept talking about how I need to sleep and eat and exercise and drink water. I asked her if that would help these episodes and she said no, just in general. I said well I do that stuff in general but how can I cope with manic episodes? She said “Like I said, just try to exercise and eat and sleep overall”.

I tried to get her to explain what bipolar was and what mania was and why it was happening but she seemed annoyed by those questions and kept repeating “just make sure you exercise daily”. It wasn’t so weird!!!

I got teary eyed because getting diagnosed with something I know nothing about was scary and very heavy for me. I know i’m an adult but I had so many emotions going through my head and I at least wanted her to explain to me what bipolar was and how I was feeling getting diagnosed with it. She didn’t even say if it was 1 or 2.

Finally she said she’s prescribing me meds and they would be at my pharmacy by that night. I just went today and she forgot to put in the prescription. I messaged her hours ago with no response.

2025-11-06 21:34:46;Bipolar + Work: Do you disclose, or keep it private?;"I’ve been thinking a lot about how other people handle bipolar disorder at work, because I feel like it’s one of those things we’re all dealing with silently.

Some of us choose not to disclose because we’re afraid of being judged, overlooked for opportunities, or seen differently. And honestly, that fear is real — stigma still exists even in places that *say* they care about mental health.

But keeping it private has its own weight too. Masking. Managing mood swings quietly. Trying to look “fine” when you’re not. It can be lonely when no one knows what you’re carrying, especially on the days when holding it together takes everything.

I’m curious how others navigate this:

* **Do you disclose your bipolar diagnosis at work?**
* If yes — who did you tell (HR, manager, coworker)? How did that go?
* If not — what helps you manage privately without burning out?
* Do you wish you had handled it differently?

No judgment either way. I know everyone’s situation is different.

2025-11-06 20:55:51;Devastated doesn't even begin to explain it.;"I'm still reeling from the catastrophic implosion of my entire life last week. This will be long, so appreciation to anyone who reads my story. 

I've been with my SO for 7 years,  3 married. On the outside, we have a fantastic life: a 1 yr child, a big beautiful house that we've only been living in for 2 years, well paying and prestigious jobs, loving and supportive families. 

But the past year has been the worst year of my entire life. We both had struggled with our MH throughout our lives (anxiety and depression), in fact it was something we bonded over and supported each other when we started dating. Since we got married, everything just happened rapid fire - a wedding, getting pregnant, moving to a new house, stressful promotions, and having a newborn. I genuinely think this broke him, maybe beyond repair. In the past, he really struggled with self medicating with alcohol and binge drinking disorder. Being drunk unleashed this angry, depressed side of him that was frankly terrifying (never directed at me, but more anger towards the world and himself). He's proudly been sober from alcohol for 3 years (since his bachelor party trip where I put my foot down and said I couldn't marry him if this continues).

The stress of everything and marijuana becoming recreationally legal in our state led to him starting off using it to relax, then it was to help him sleep, and then he started lying to me about his use. It was every day, all evening. I had no problem with it until I realized the extent of the use, the same patterns as alcohol, and how negatively it was impacting his mental health and behavior. He was angry, irritable, agitated, pacing and rushing around like a tornado. He was suicidal and sobbing out of nowhere thinking about his mortality, his love for his son and me, and the impact of being a father. He cussed me out a few times, shocking because he'd never done something like that in the past. He was hypersexual, which I had no problem indulging him in so long as it was with only me. He struggled to stay asleep, again unusual for him. I pushed and pushed until he finally got reconnected with a psychiatrist, and quit the weed. 

At the time, we thought this was severe anxiety and depression. How wrong we were. After little to no improvement and the hypersexuality becoming apparent, he finally was diagnosed with BP2. He was relieved to finally have a diagnosis that made sense for him and an explanation as to why antidepressants weren't helping him. The medications seemed to be helping him. He was sleeping again, his hypersexuality (or so I thought...) came down to our normal frequency, his depression was more manageable. But I caught him 4 weeks after he promised to quit vaping in the bathroom. He works from home and I don't, so he waited until I was at work to sneak back to the dispensary and buy more. It resulted in a confrontation and explosive fight and him quitting and throwing away his stash again. But my trust had been damaged. 

The next few months were tense, with my hypervigilance causing accusations and arguments then reconciliation where he told me how much he loves me and our family, how he wants to be a better husband and father, and how he would do anything to help me trust him again. And this cycle continued, because deep down I just KNEW he was still hiding something. Every time he'd gaslight me, manipulate me into thinking I was crazy, and my paranoia was damaging our relationship. I even spoke to my therapist about thinking I was delusional, because the intrusive thoughts wouldn't stop. And then, last Thursday, I finally found what I was looking for. And it was so much worse than I even could have imagined. 

I found his secret Reddit accounts. For the past 6 months, he's been posting nudes of himself in married NSFW subreddits, gooning and edging, commenting on pornographic posts with all the things he wanted to do to them. He was DMing people multiple times a day, every day for 6 months. Exchanging nudes, sexting, talking about our private sex life and the things we do. He even shared photos of me and enjoyed the sexual things people said about my body. His posts clearly stated he was married, and wife doesn't know. Wife is out of the house. Wife wouldn't like this. Wife is right next to me and doesn't know. I also got out of him he was using Discord to video chat and masturbate on camera with other people. All of this, dozens of times a day while I was at work. For 6 MONTHS. He did it on my birthday. He did it it on Mothers Day. He was doing it at his brother's wedding. 

He says it was like a thrill, a fantasy to him. It was for attention. The dopamine rush was all he cared about. That he hadn't met up with anyone in real life, or had any intent to do so. He never talked to anyone outside of Reddit or Discord. He knew it was wrong, but didn't at the time think it was cheating. But I can't believe a single word out of his mouth. I'm still uncovering lies of omission. He relapsed on marijuana again after 2 months (leaving his phone at home to not be tracked from location sharing, sneaky bastard) and on top of it was using kratom and nicotine. He's telling me he doesn't want me to leave, that he loves me and is still highly attracted to me, and asking if I will work with him while he gets treatment. That he would never, ever physically cheat on me and he can 100% commit to being with me for the rest of his life. He says this time is different from the others because he's at his rock bottom. My family and closest friends know, some of his family knows as I kicked him out initially. I've protected him and held his secrets which became my pain, but finally everything has come to light. But I let him come back while I was making up my mind, for the sake of our son. Though we are existing as roommates and sleeping in different beds. 

I genuinely believe I am traumatized. I'm having panic attacks every night, I can't get the images of his nudes and the things he said out of my mind. I'm uncomfortable in my own home and bed because he took pictures all over our house and I can't stop being reminded about it. Confused and hurt as I cannot wrap my brain around this,  how he could say he loves me, do things to improve our relationship, even touch me while he was doing this. Violated and used that he reduced me to an object, shared my pictures without consent, and got off on the secrecy and deception. I can't eat or sleep. I'm spiteful and vengeful and a shell of who I used to be.

But deep down, I still love him even though I am not in love with him right now. I hesitate to make that decision about divorce because of our son. I see some effort on his part, making appointments with therapists to address his sex addiction/other addictions and couples counseling for us. I made my own appointment with a CSAT to address my betrayal trauma. Going into the office every day instead of working from home, and giving me full access and every password. Deleting the accounts and apps, and allowing accountability apps to be installed. But I would feel like a fool to commit to working on it with him and to be duped again. 

So I really want to hear from anyone who was in a similar situation. Anyone who actually recovered from this, whose partners successfully did the work to improve themselves and the relationship, and stayed stable on their medications. Is it even possible? How much of this is their illness, or is it really just who they really are deep down? Do you live in fear it will happen again, or did you learn to trust again? Anything to help me make this monumental decision.

I was diagnosed a few years ago, didn’t feel much change from the medication so convinced myself I probably didn’t have it because I felt ‘normal’. I am now understanding that it’s possible my normal is not normal. 

I am mostly interested in how you figured out that the way you regulate emotions is irregular. I am having trouble coming to terms with that. I read that bipolar has waves that come in days/weeks but I feel like my mood swings at the hourly and randomly (I haven’t tracked daily mood, so it’s entirely possible I have this cyclical stuff too). I also have some form of depression/low mood so that probably makes it harder to evaluate. 

I’m sorry if I’m all over the place, I’m mostly just looking to figure out what was it that made you realize that something was irregular.

And just as follow up I am seeing a different doctor next week and am going to be less cagey and open (hopefully) to the diagnosis.

2025-11-06 15:35:12;Did therapy help you?;"Hi everyone,

I was recently diagnosed bipolar type 2 after being misdiagnosed with depression which I imagine a lot of you can relate to.

With my recent diagnosis I’ve been referred on for therapy which I am skeptical of for a number of reasons.

I’ve had therapy experiences pre diagnosis which I didn’t find useful as it was basically just someone to explode to for an hour or so without any actual advice, insight or constructive conversation.  I’d just be told things like “love love yourself” and “it’s ok to feel that way” 

I’m two sessions into my therapy post diagnosis and I’m thinking about stopping it. The reasons for this are I’m paying £150 a session and after two sessions I’m getting much of the same vibes as my therapy experience pre diagnosis. I’ve been told to do yoga, to love myself and to allow myself to feel certain ways.

I personally just don’t find that sort of stuff useful as it feels very soft and doesn’t exactly help or align with the extremes of the lows when it comes to things like severe suicidal thoughts/plans.

Again, please be honest.

2025-11-06 14:06:37;Stupidity and immaturity or hypomania/mania?;"How do you distinguish between behaving poorly versus behaving poorly because of bipolar disorder. The latter feels like an excuse, and the former makes you question why you did what you did and why you keep repeatedly doing so. It fills you with shame, guilt, and hopelessness. A formal diagnosis helps with that, it gives you a reason, it tells you your brain is a little quirky, but with all that self awareness you can’t help but feel like an imposter using excuses to justify a dysfunctional life. 

My grandma came to me 2 days ago and said “can I ask you something if you won’t get angry?”. I said go ahead. “What’re you thinking about in terms of career? What do you want to do? You’re 29 now, if not now then when?”. She’s right. I quit everything I start, everything that’s good for me, everything that makes me happy and proud, because yet another low energy phase after some colossal stupidity has me bed bound. I’m not a functional adult. I don’t trust that I ever will be, as much as I want to, because I’ve never experienced a life where I built so much greatness without falling down into a deeper and darker pit hole.

2025-11-06 13:21:56;I want to die;"Background: I was diagnosed a little while ago and put on lamotrigine and then lithium I was doing okay for a bit. I finally felt capable of taking care of myself. I felt a way I didn’t know was possible. The depressive suicidal fog of shame and self hatred I had lived in was gone. My life stress factors still existed but I was able to remain determined and hopeful. But I’ve been experiencing bad side effects and I couldn’t figure out which medication they could be from, so I decided to stop the lamictil to get answers. I’m tapering off and I’ve gone down to 50mg. 

I’m not sure if it’s because of coming off the lamictil, or my life circumstances, but either way, I can’t do this anymore. I can’t go on any longer. I feel sad because I thought for a short time that my life could be different, but now I am more suicidal than ever. 

Ive been unemployed for a few months now,  and I am dealing with extreme financial stress. I have zero dollars to my name. Im late on bills. I need to pay for things that I quite literally don’t have the money for. I’ve been applying to so many different places but I haven’t been able to land anything. I’ll call places after applying, only for them to tell me the position is not open. I’ve had 4 different places schedule interviews with me, and then let me know right before the interview that the position has been filled. Other places don’t respond at all. My anxiety has been getting worse and worse the longer this has gone on, and even more extreme since the med changes. I’ve become increasingly hopeless and defeated as time has gone on. I had an interview yesterday that was my one last hope, and they haven’t gotten back to me- which I’m assuming means I didn’t get the job. 

I truly have zero hope now. I am facing the threat of so many consequences from not being able to pay for things, and there’s no way out of this that I can see. I just don’t know what to do I’ve tried everything. I can’t even afford to get gas for my car. I dont have a way to pay for all the things I need to pay for. Im also dealing with a very toxic living situation and family relationships. I feel like this all sounds so small but it is life or death. I don’t know how to describe the amount of profound hopelessness, overwhelm, self hatred, shame, and anxiety I feel. There is simply no solution. I am stuck. And I give up. I felt this way for years before I was diagnosed, but this time it’s being caused by something as big and impossible to live without such as money. As equally as exasperated as I am that the job market is out of my control, and that there is so little I can do considering I can’t force places to hurt me, I also hate and blame myself for not having it figured out by now. I hate myself. I hate everything. Im so fucking irritable, every single noise makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs. I can’t handle how it feels in my body to feel so fucking irrationally angry. Everything is so triggering. I just want to escape. I feel so trapped. And it’s all from the having extreme stress caused by something I can’t fix. I wish there was another way out, but there’s not. I’m exhausted. Im a burden. I’m a loser. I’m so so so tired of feeling this way. I can’t do it any longer. 

Im going to wait one more day to hear back from the place I interviewed yesterday, and if I don’t I’m thinking of planning for when I will end my life. Ive already thought of how I will do it and where, but I want to tie up some things. I feel guilty so at the thought of leaving my family and friends behind, but I don’t know what else to do.

2025-11-06 11:41:14;"Struggling with feeling ""different"" after mood stabilisers";"I'm not sure how to explain this. Had a severe episode last year that resulted in me finding the correct diagnosis, as far as I know. Noticed a massive improvement in my recovery since taking Lamictal. Things didn't really start to get better until I tried it for the first time at the suggestion of my doctor.

I've always been called an ""intense person"" since I was a child. 

Before taking Lamotrigine, my creativity as a musician was unique and idiosyncratic, I always had a thing for novel chord progressions and they would almost feel euphoric and beautiful in an otherworldly way. Music was an almost religious experience, I had immense drive to achieve etc. 

The subtleties of everything were fully experienced. I was more verbose and eccentric. It's early days, but recently my doctor increased my dose from 50mg twice daily to 75mg twice daily, and I can't help but find life less enjoyable, and as a HSP it really feels like my identity has changed. Things don't annoy me as much but I feel less vibrant. It's like I used to see in ultraviolet and infrared; everything was tinged with deep meaning and interconnectedness. Now I can only see visible light. It's not so exciting.

Who am I when the very delicate neurochemical functions - dopamine sensitivity, glutamate excitability - are being fundamentally changed? Is it ethically right to do this from a philosophical perspective etc. 

My depression and elation gave my music and my art great depth and emotional resonance, but it would spiral quite quickly into illness.

Does anyone what struggle with creative/artistic identity after medication? Is this likely a temporary change due to the recent titration? I seem to be very sensitive to meds.";r/BipolarReddit;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1opoj1g/struggling_with_feeling_different_after_mood/

It’s either I’m doing too much or feeling miserable for 2 months .My sleep is broken during this time. I wake up standing next to my bed. I’ll stand up first then wake up because I’m standing. I went to the worst mental health facility in my state that has multiple lawsuits as we speak.

So fast forward to November, I feel better. Sleeping throughout the night. Feelings are less intense. It’s been like this for 4 years. I’ve had therapists try to explain to me but it just feels harder to explain, clearly I can’t control it, I take my meds daily. I guess episodes still happen but are worse during that time.

2025-11-06 09:33:38;How is Bipolar + ADHD treated?;"For context: I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 (recently), Anxiety, and OCD, but I've always suspected I could have ADHD.

Recently, my Therapist said she's starting to notice more symptoms than just Bipolar, OCD, and Anxiety, and that it seems to her I could maybe have ADHD. I got scared since all this time I thought my problems would be over once the Bipolar medication started having effect (started a mood stabilizer today, with nothing else to go along with for now - I've tried antipsychotics, but the side effects were horrible in my experience). As far as I know, people with Bipolar cannot be on Stimulants since it increases the risk of Mania/Hypomania.

So it got me questioning. In cases like this. What should a person with both ADHD and Bipolar do to treat themselves? I've heard there are medications other than Stimulants that can treat ADHD, is it true? and do those go well alongside Bipolar?

I'm followed by professionals, a therapist and a psychiatrist. I'm not requesting a diagnosis. Just hypothesizing out of curiosity, what could be done in a case like this (in which the person has the full diagnosis of Bipolar + ADHD), what questions should one bring up to their doctors, and what is known and has been studied by professionals about this matter.";r/bipolar2;6;29;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1opls6w/how_is_bipolar_adhd_treated/
2025-11-06 08:49:39;Seriously considering changing my meds;"I was diagnosed 3 years ago and I’ve been on Vraylar since. I was incredibly lucky that the first pick worked so well for me. My psych at the time landed on it because I had healthcare through my university and they wanted something that didn’t require constant monitoring like lithium and as they put it, this med is less likely to cause weight issues. But lately I’ve noticed a lot of breakthrough symptoms. I’m currently riding through a low grade hypomanic episode that’s lasted for a few weeks now. I can’t up the dosage because we tried that and I started having muscle issues. Also started overheating really badly this summer. 

And then there’s the weight gain. It hasn’t been drastic but despite all I try my weight has been slowly creeping upwards the last few years (and I was already struggling from untreated depression and grad school).

I can’t do lamictal because I break out (thankfully didn’t get THE rash).

I know my new psych will have recommendations and preferences and that everyone is different, but I’d love to hear the experiences of others on other meds. I’m considering asking about lithium honestly even though I know that requires a lot more maintenance. But I’m at a point in my life now where that is possible.

Also what should i expect if they switch my meds? I assume I’ll have to taper? I’ve never done that before.";r/bipolar2;2;8;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1opkt58/seriously_considering_changing_my_meds/

2025-11-06 08:04:43;I appreciate how supportive this community is.;"About three or so years ago I was diagnosed bipolar two and put on antipsychotics, which at the time smoothed out a lot of my issues. After gaining 60lbs and learning I had insulin resistance, I decided to try and come off my meds and birth control since they can worsen insulin resistance. I did this under the supervision of my psych, and lo and behold that as the insulin resistance got better, I stopped getting what I was consistently told were “depressive episodes”. Then while continuing therapy and the supervision of my psych, learned that IR was causing downswings, and being on birth control which made my hormonal swings irregular (hormonal IUD) thus causing the very similar to hypomanic that the follicular phase can bring out in hormone sensitive individuals… explained all the symptoms that caused my bipolar like symptoms. I’ve now been off the antipsychotics and hormonal birth control for a year, I haven’t had a return of the depressive symptoms outside of the occasional bad day and all of my “hypomanic” looking times follow my cycle perfectly so they’re easy to plan for and manage. 

I say all this not because I think many people get misdiagnosed, but actually because I wanted to say thank you to everyone here who was very supportive and helped me maintain a clear head through it all. Also… don’t do anything without talking to your mental health professionals first!!

2025-11-06 07:51:14;I actually have something positive!;"I've been diagnosed depressed for years but got diagnosed BP a year ago, I'm still new in my journey of finding what meds work for me.

My first psych was a PNP. She was very kind but for all my meds she would flip through a big book to see doses and interactions, but I just thought that was because she was an PNP and this is just how it goes.

I had to be a huge advocate for myself and tell her what meds I wanted to be on and what doses, she didn't offer much insight. I just thought this is what it was like.

Our meetings started getting short and she stopped being as kind. I thought I did something then she told me she was quitting. I immediately said ""Oh no."" And I saw her face and was like ""Well... good for you I guess."" And she was like ""Yeah! I'm so excited."" Like wtf, I get this is her life and career but I was mortified, this was my safety net. Starting over and meeting someone new sounded so scary. Then I thought I'd see her one more time because she just started me on a new med and she said Nope, and scheduled me out 4 months with someone new. 

I missed that appt out of sheer anxiety then had to wait 2 more months. I finally met him yesterday (also a PNP), I was sweating profusely. I had to go over my life history, do new assessments, yada yada.

Then we get to the meds. He was SO knowledgeable. Every med, side effect, doses, interactions. Gave me a ton of options and is basically doing an entire medication overhaul. Not all at once but we've already made some changes and I'm weaning off other ones. It's literally night and day from the last psych. Also my meds I was on sucked so now my life in general has some hope. I'm not delusional to think everything is going to magically get fixed right away, but I feel like there's a light at the end of my tunnel.

There was even an issue with one med and he called the pharmacy within the hour and got it fixed. He's amazing and I feel so good the future.

I just wanted to tell someone, it's something small but a big win for me. Thanks for reading.";r/bipolar2;40;7;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1opjg9j/i_actually_have_something_positive/
2025-11-06 07:47:35;Confused and need second opinions;"This will be a novel bare with me! 
I'm currently awaiting a solid diagnosis (yes or no) for bipolar 2. I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a young teen (I'm almost 26 now). Here's what got me to this situation:

5 months ago I got genetic testing done to see what antidepressants work for me. I got stuck in a bad enough depressive episode again that made me consider medication again after 5 years of raw dogging it. When I was 16-19 I tried 4 different. SSRI/SNRIs. All sucked. Didn't have a good experience on any. Fast forward this gene test, all of those are on my significant gene-drug interaction list. In fact, only 2 anti-depressants (SNRIs) are on my a-ok list. 

I'm taking pristiq and had it upped to 50mg and almost exactly 3 months in I had a manic episode. Had to admit myself to the ER for what I was assuming was serotonin syndrome. Was in for 4 days, resting heart rate 130 tachycardic yadada on Ativan for 4 days. 

I've never had a manic episode like that before and it was quite terrifying. I was told to get evaluated for bipolar 2, so naturally, me being me, I start researching it bc I've never thought about bipolar before. It's resonating a lot. 

Saw a psych. She said I'm probably bipolar but it just needs further confirmation and she'll probably try me on a mood stabilizer. One week later I saw her again and all of a sudden she doesn't think I'm bipolar and is trying to prescribe me an SSRI, which I should not take. I'm so confused now 

Has anyone had a similar experience with the whole mania thing and antidepressants? Or does any of this sound like a familiar experience for anyone? I have never been hospitalized for mania like that before or depression, but I do get bouts of clinical depression that can last up to 4 months. 

Im heavily pondering the difference between hypomanic and non-depressed. The depression is easy for me to spot and define. I clearly have never been full blown manic like that before cause I simply was acting a fool and was scaring everyone around me. I have an appointment set up with a NEW psych on dec 11th but that's so far away lol ";r/bipolar2;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1opjd66/confused_and_need_second_opinions/

2025-11-06 07:06:15;Edibles. I need encouragement to stop using them, or, told it's not so bad to keep using if nothing else is working. Yeah. I am mental as hell.;"I have been using edibles for 4 years. 20-30 mg every night. I started out of desperation about 4 years ago because doctors had given me everything under the sun for my chronic (since childhood) insomnia. I got so hooked on benzos and they handed it out like candy to me. Because of my husband demanding, I get off of them because of the way I was acting and the severe memory loss, I somehow weaned myself off and it was hell. I started the edibles at the tail end of getting off the benzos and it helped me so much! For the first time in so long I was able to sleep and not have horrible side effects the next day. I found ones that had CBN worked better. Currently using the the Snoozy brand sleep with benefits gummies.
Fast forward to almost 2 years ago being diagnosed (finally) with Biplor 1. I have always known I had some sort of severe mental problems. Grew up with a lot of cult-like spiritual abuse and neglect. Was taught all mental illness was sin. So I tried to hide it as best I could until I did a major move 2 years ago and was under extreme stress, finally processing my past because i finally moved eight hundred miles away from family and the cult. My biploar exploded. I never thought I could be more miserable than when I had severe postpartum depression for over a year with both of my kids. But the last 2 years have been a mental hell I never thought could exist.
I also have a very painful chronic bladder disorder that makes it very hard to sleep with. And I’ve had that since I was sixteen, still working on trying to figure out relief for that.
That is another reason why the edibles helped me so much, because they really helped ease the pain at night. I've been dealing with chronic pain and insomnia for so long I do not know what it's like to feel normal.
My psychiatrist wants me to get off of the edibles of course, but she's not too pushy though lately she is pushing more. She gave me rasparadone and seroquel to try to get off the edibles but I had horrible side effects even at very low doses on both.  I always went back to the edibles, because the side effects, the next day seemed nonexistent, and it helped my bladder.
I have been on the lamotrigine for the last two years at a very high dose, and then added lithium 600mg a day about a year ago. Long story, but I am in the process of getting off the lithium because once again it caused horrible side effects with my bladder and other things, my kidneys were showing signs of decline. Also, I have hashimotos and hypothyroidism... lithium really messed me up. I am one of the unlucky ones with that med I guess.
I have been in a 3 week hell of insomnia because of some really stressful things coming up from my past. The edibles are only working a couple hours at a time now, and I'm taking up to 50 mg each night to sleep and fall back asleep.
I really want to quit the edibles cold turkey to just see if I start to feel better physically and mentally, because now I'm starting to wonder if my psychiatrist is right and it's making my bipolar much worse. I've only had a few weeks the whole last 2 years of mental relief. I think about suicide all the time now. 
I guess what I'm searching for is people's experience getting off of it or experiences staying on it for sleep. Sometimes it's really frustrating that they hand out seroquel, like candy, but demonize edibles. But what do I know? I'm not a doctor. I love my psychiatrist, but at the same time she is starting to push more that I get off of them. I think she thinks they're making me much worse. And who knows maybe they are. They didn't for the first two years, I was using them though. And I’ve always been pretty mental, even as a teen, like, trying to jump out of cars, etc. I've run away multiple times.
Anyway, I guess I just want some hope that maybe I could feel better quitting the edibles, because I feel like a complete mental zombie right now. She has only offered me one other thing to try and I forgot the name. But after she started listing out the potential side effects, I just get scared, because I don't want more pain in my bladder.
I think tonight I might try seroquel again but I'm dreading the pain it caused my bladder the next day. The mental hell that pain causes me makes everything in my head feel worse and exuberates the feeling of wanting to give up.
I feel so defeated and stuck.
The lack of sleep and the mental hell this last two years feels like it's aged me at least ten years. I am 39 and I feel 70.
Thanks for any help or insight. 
Please be kind. Really fragile.
I do have an amazing husband and 2 teenage daughters that are a extremely good support system to me. And like I said, I love my psychiatrist, but other than that, I have no one. No friends. Two years of trying to survive and hide the extreme bipolar can make one extremely lonely.

Really leaning into the theory that no experience is unique and hoping someone can give me better words so the psychiatrist stops looking at me like I’ve gone crazy (again).

I’ve been finding that whenever I’m overstimulated my brain feels like it’s fizzing (almost like a shaken up soda can) and I’m finding this makes my brain physically hurt (despite brains having no nerve endings for pain). The issue is it doesn’t settle down once I’ve removed the stimulus and that left me shuffling around with brain pain all night unable to sleep.

I explained this to the psychiatrist who said it sounds like I’m still experiencing mania but am now able to manage myself? I’m very new to this and not entirely sure that’s accurate but don’t know how else to explain it better.

I am worried about him, but have done all I can for 3 months. But I feel so lonely. I feel like there love of my life has been stolen from me, but he currently can't realize that his behavior is out of character in his elated state.

At this point he has stated that even though I ""taught him that hehe couldn't share,"" he still would like to be friends and even give relationship advice. But he doesn't want to even sniff any talks about anything relating to our past relationship. I drew a firm boundary in return that I can't be friends with someone I can't talk about the things that matter too me (I had been talking with people about what happened and my emotions).

Looking back, I think he has been cycling for the entirety of our relationship between hypomania and depression. I'm between this times we would do things together, chat etc. But he mentioned something yesterday about our supposedly recurring problems kept happening ever 5-6 months. 

He's undiagnosed and I was unaware of any major feelings of resentment due to is always talking things out, so I'm assuming based on his behavior that he could be bipolar.

2025-11-06 04:51:05;For anyone with bipolar what does it feel like when you’re in a depressive phase and someone you care about reaches out?;"Someone I love told me a month ago that he’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He broke up with me during what seemed like a mixed episode, and later said he feels numb and doesn’t even feel like himself anymore. He also told me that apart from his doctor, I’m the only person he’s shared this with.

Since then I’ve tried to give him space and not pressure him about “us.” I mostly check in ask if he’s sleeping or eating better. He always responds eventually, but sometimes it takes 2–3 days.

I know he’s probably going through a depressive phase, but I don’t know how to interpret this silence. Is it normal to go quiet like that even with someone you care about?  
Do messages like mine feel comforting, or overwhelming? And when you’re in that headspace, do you still think about the people you love, or does the depression make it hard to feel anything at all?

I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve been there I just want to understand better not judge.";r/BipolarSOs;6;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1opet57/for_anyone_with_bipolar_what_does_it_feel_like/
2025-11-06 04:43:02;Stigma hurts everyone, not just people being stigmatized.;"I don't think this is discussed nearly enough and I think it's important for the SO side as well.

Stigma is the mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, trait or quality of a person. Stigma hurts everyone involved.

Stigma is why when discussing bipolar with anyone who hasn't had direct experience is met with ""just leave them"". It's why you're questioned for why you would be with someone ""like that"".

Stigma is pervasive and causes people to refuse their diagnosis because ""I'm not like *them*"". Stigma causes shame and fear of being open. It's why we have to seek solace in a specialized form. It's why you're questioned ""how did you not see the signs?"" after a discard. It's why you're blamed for being with someone who has a disorder.

People with downs syndrome were stigmatized for a long time. So were people with depression. Or autism. Or ADHD.

Removing stigma and breaking it down is important for everyone. Nothing really changes unless we make it change.";r/BipolarSOs;16;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1opelba/stigma_hurts_everyone_not_just_people_being/
2025-11-06 04:23:00;Need advice for how to talk about BP2 possibility;"Trigger warning for very brief mention of SH urges

A month ago I saw a psych NP, tried getting back on two meds i used to be on. One of them never got sent right bc another doctor had to do it and the other (lamotrigene) i just didn't get a routine for and stopped trying because I got super demotivated missing is consistently. We discussed the possibility, my husband sees a lot of his mom's symptoms in me, small bumps in the road make me spiral, I have almost delusional amounts of paranoia, cleaning and buying sprees, racing thoughts, the works. 

Well i'm slightly coming out of what's most likely a hypomanic episode, probably 5 days now. I've completely rearranged the whole house in two days. Its a 3 room, 2 story duplex. I redid the living room, dining room, garage, and guest room. I'm not really done either. I made a huge mess and I'm feeling ashamed my husband and roommates basically woke up to it or came home to it without warning. I got so worked up i didn't even think to send a text saying i was gonna do it. I probably would've redone my roommates room if I were allowed. I redid my hair coloring. Made a huge mess in the bathroom with that. I've barely been sleeping in comparison to what I usually need. I usually need like 8-10 hours of sleep, i'm high sleep needs. But I've been going to bed around 130-3am and waking up by 9am. I usually force myself to go to bed too, make myself get ready and take melatonin to help because I don't usually have time in my day for naps. Part of why I rearranged the stairs closet so suddenly was because the whole day at work it felt like my whole nervous system was electrified and >! I kept getting images in my head of my arms completely cut up and bloody!< and I wanted to avoid the temptation.  

I'm forcing myself to go the the doctors appointment, I know if I don't ill start avoiding other stuff too like cleaning or general errands. I know this is probably a bigger deal than I want it to be, and the NP said we can discuss it more if I had another episode. The thing is I just get such bad anxiety thinking medical professionals will think i'm full of it if i tell them my symptoms or think i'm seeking a specific diagnosis. Its probably irrational but can anyone give me advice for how to really go about this? Or encouragement of sorts? I might bring one of my roommates so it looks less like i'm lying or something.

2025-11-06 03:18:35;Home from the psych ward!;"Hello all! 

I made a post here a couple of days ago in regard to my psych ward visit. 

I just wanted to share that I am home, and am feeling much more stable now. I was admitted and stayed for approximately 1 week. During that week, I got my medications adjusted, got clean off of weed and alcohol, and actually got the help that I needed.

I feel validated. I feel real. I feel like myself, and I haven’t felt this okay in YEARS. 

If you’re questioning whether or not the hospital is the right choice for you, just know it is absolutely the fastest way to get help. People WILL take you seriously there, it all just depends on the facility. 

I’m happy to say, I can get back to my life now. I can start to heal and repair the damage I’ve caused prior to my diagnosis. 

I feel alive again. 

Wishing you all the best on your journey ❤️ 

Thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. Your support means the world to me.

2025-11-06 02:55:59;Shame;"I’m going to be talking to my psychologist about this, but I’m starting to realize how much shame I’m constantly carrying because of my diagnosis.

I’m having to file for bankruptcy at 30 because of manic spending. I’ve lost so many relationships because of mood episodes. I’m having to ask for accommodations at work because I’m so sedated in the mornings from medications. No one in my family or even my boyfriend understands what I go through or has any desire to understand, so I’m mostly on my own in my head, which is a dangerous place to be.

I’m ashamed because I’m not “normal”. I’ll be dealing with this for the rest of my life while everyone else around me doesn’t have any problems. I feel alone and lost so much of the time and no one can help me, and I feel so embarrassed when I have to reach out for help, only to be told I’m overreacting, shouldn’t drink caffeine, or that I’m not trying hard enough to “overcome” my illness.

Part of me just wants to disappear, be truly on my own where I can’t cause problems anymore. If no one can support me anyway, why am I sticking around here? My boyfriend could find someone without a disability and my family wouldn’t need to deal with me. Not sure what’s holding me back.";r/bipolar;44;8;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1opbnya/shame/

2025-11-06 01:11:57;ADVICE NEEDED;"Has anyone else experienced this?

I’ve been stable on my meds for 8 ish months, I’m not sure why but lately I’ve been consumed with the thoughts of “I’m not who I really am” when I’m on my meds. I’m a very upbeat and happy person but it’s like I know what I’m like when I’m not on my medication and it makes me feel fake in a sense. Everyone asks me how and why I’m so happy all of the time but lately I’ve noticed that when I’m happy and am able to be happy, I cling to it bc I know what it’s like to be horribly depressed.

My old therapist had told me summed up that who I am while on medication and stable is who I would be if I didn’t have the disorder. I just worry about ever having to go back to the version of myself that wasn’t stable. I’ve honestly forgotten what it feels like to go through the motions of bipolar disorder so intensely. I mean yeah I get sad every now and then but not even close to what it used to be. I don’t want to make it my identity bc it’s not me, it’s just a part of me. I wanted to eventually be able to get off medication but I fear the best version of myself might be the medicated one.

I’ve been diagnosed for 5 years now and every now and then I question “Do I really have bipolar disorder?” I struggled with that the entire 5 years have been re-evaluated multiple times and met every single criteria. And the first 2 years I was in denial. It just seems so unrealistic and I still somehow feel in denial like “no way that can’t be me” because of how happy I feel now. Especially since I’ve been on medication it’s almost like I want to ruin my “normalcy” by going off my medication to see if I’m “really” bipolar.

2025-11-06 00:06:16;Looking for advice re being open about my diagnosis;"Hi all, just wanted some advice. 

I’m a 24F studying medicine, and my friend who I’m paired with has got a lot more distant recently. This seems to have been since I said I wasn’t doing too well with my Bipolar. She seems quite naive about the illness despite me trying to explain how it accepts me, and really didn’t enjoy being on the psych ward for placement and was making quite judgemental comments about patients with schizophrenia/bipolar. 

I’m not really sure how to approach this. It’s known in our friend group that she’s quite naive to a lot of subjects generally, but it’s making me quite upset now - I thought perhaps it was overwhelming for her, but I keep the messages about it to a minimum, like ‘hey, not doing too well mentally right now, may not be on placement’ and she seems to almost be angry about it. I’m not sure really where to go with this. 

All of my other friends are so much more accepting and I’d go to them first, despite this person supposedly being my best friend. It’s making me feel quite isolated, and like I shouldn’t be reaching out about my condition. I feel like it might be more on the judgment side from her, rather than the overwhelming side. 

Either way, I don’t talk about it to her a lot. I was just wondering if anyone else has had this before, and how to deal with it?

I loved lithium, but had to stop for thyroid and kidney issues. Vraylar made me so nauseous I could barely function, Geodon made me ""twitchy"" and restless, and Seroquel was so sedating I couldn't function. 

I am on 200 of lamotrigine, and I have Ativan for if things get really out of hand.  My doctor wanted me to try Caplyta and gave me samples. I tried 10 mg and got zero sleep the first time I took it, and didn't want to take it again. But I fell into a really depressed state and my psychiatrist urge me to try again. 

The good news is that it lifted me out of my depression almost immediately. The bad news is,  after a week on 10 mg, I felt like I was hypomanic bordering on full mania - caught myself in a bit of a spending spree, uncomfortable racing thoughts, not getting sleep, etc. Last night I felt like I was crawling out of my skin to the point I really considered going to the hospital. I didn't take my dose last night, took an Ativan, and feel ""up"" but mildly better this morning. 

I spoke to my doctor this morning and he doesn't think such a small dose would cause anything that fast, but I have never flipped like that in my life. I have an appointment with him later this week, but I'm wondering if anyone else has a similar experience with Caplyta and mania.

my episodes are less frequent now but they’re more severe. by far. setting aside the manic episode that changed (and almost completely socially ruined) my life, i’ve been in a mixed episode for almost an entire month now. maybe two. and i hate it more than anything i’ve ever experienced. 

it started off with just depression, and then at night i kept finding excuses to stay up, and that started triggering manic symptoms. now, during the day, i spend hours on a project i’m in the middle of only to swing hours later into horrible depression - its to the point that i just managed to talk myself out of suicide purely on the basis of “but you won’t be able to finish what you’re working on!!”.

i don’t understand. i’ve never once gone off of my meds since my diagnosis at 15. i go to therapy, i work on myself, i set healthy boundaries, i self reflect and stop thought spirals and i adjust my medications when i think i need it and now it just feels like no matter what i do my body and brain punish me for it. it happens with my physical disability, too. i don’t think many people outside of this sub will ever understand how it feels when your brain is actively working against you, desperate to destroy itself even when you do everything in your power to keep things right

this mixed episode is the worst episode i’ve ever experienced in my life. i just got out of a 2 year relationship, amicably and without anyone or anything to feel angry over, and i haven’t even had a SINGLE moment to grieve it between financial struggles, interpersonal issues, and my own head. it’s been almost 3 weeks and i’ve only felt sad twice andit just makes me so angry. i’ve been so goddamn angry all the time, that’s another thing but whatever.";r/bipolar;4;17;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oozgbf/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_this_fucking/

As the title suggests, I’ve always wanted to start a YouTube channel, but didn’t know if it was for me. Originally I wanted to share my art (I’m an artist) but since getting diagnosed with Bipolar I, I was thinking about talking about mental health on there too, things like ‘what helped most with my depression’ or videos where I paint and talk, keeping it a friendly vibe.

I feel like making videos would give me some more structure right now and sense of purpose. However, I worry about vulnerability and possible regret later on.

I don’t even use social media and don’t really like to overshare, but for me, I feel compelled to speak on this topic because I have lived experiences and have survived suicidal lows, and so I don’t see why I’m supposed to feel ashamed of that…

I guess my biggest concern is if future employers find my content and discriminate me because of it. I actually started making a few videos already and got really excited about YouTube, but then got anxious and thought about quitting…now I’m thinking about giving it another go.

2025-11-05 14:02:02;HYPOventilation caused by over-concentration during hypomania stage.;"Didn't find useful information around/google. (Case a bit specific, I guess, and hidden postscript for more context). 
Does any one have recommendation on how to avoid it? Maybe someone had similar experience and can share solutions (like constant manual breathing reminder, untill it becomes an automatic process?)

&nbsp;

 Every time I’m on the “hypomanic” part of the mood spectrum, if I have to do something that requires high concentration - I stop breathing, I stop hearing or seeing anything around me. If I stay in that state of concentration for too long, breathing becomes a nearly manual task. In such case: when it’s time to sleep, even if I’m completely exhausted, it takes about 30–60 minutes of constantly waking up because I literally stop breathing while falling asleep (similar vibe to apnea when you’ve got allergies).  The same breathing problem after a long-concentration period can be problematic even when I brush my teeth or do any other task (e.g. writing post like this)

I more or less can control it through physical exercise,  metronome, or watches constant reminder - that’s usually enough to fall asleep faster and get decent rest at the end of the day. But when it comes to work/hobby - it’s a total nightmare, especially considering the consequences of poor sleep (which obviously will make my mental condition worse for the next few days), therefore only solution right now is avoid&chill for 3 days. 

I don’t even know how often I breathe in those moments, but if I try to take at least 8 breaths per minute, I’m feel lightheaded  - not to mention the ""normal 12–16 breaths per minute"" when I'm ready to faint, because of all the oxygen intake. It was the same decades ago in childhood, when I first visited a doctor (and even had a couple of fainting episodes at that time). 

&nbsp;

P.S. For context: I’ve had a history of bad local healthcare, doctors AKA ""sorry we have no idea, let's swap diagnosis and/or drugs"" and being basically turned into a vegetable with neuroleptics and other crap, because that’s what they do if they don’t know what’s happening, that’s the methodic they use here if they can’t find a solution.  
 Because of that, I spent most of my life feeling empty. So you could say I had BD in childhood, then a huge period without emotions or feelings, and a couple of years ago, thanks to a good doctor who explained the level of local medicine in plain terms and advised me to stop the neuroleptics, I made a leap straight from the womb to a 100 km marathon, getting acknowledged I had bipolar disorder all that time long. So everything related to BD was new to me  and the first six months of these past two years were pure hell of adapting.";r/BipolarReddit;3;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oov6hf/hypoventilation_caused_by_overconcentration/
2025-11-05 12:34:40;I feel like no one understands me;"Approximately 2.8% of Adults in the US have Bipolar disorder. I’ve met people who have bipolar and none of them seem to understand me. They tell me about their problems I tell them about mine and I’m treated like I’m truly insane for the things I’ve done. 

All the people I’ve talked to told me about their manic episodes: talking fast and being super hyper. I tell them I’ve been to the hospital for alcohol poisoning 15+ times, have gotten several felonies, escaped the psych ward, spent thousands on a credit card that wasn’t mine, built and arc for god, I can’t even say all I’ve done. 

When I tell them this things change. They start spewing out other disorders despite the fact I’ve been diagnosed 4-5 times by different psychiatrists. Every time I tell someone about my manic episodes and then how I get so depressed I can’t leave bed they act like I’m some sort of freak. Like the brief mood swings they have are bipolar and what I have is something crazier. They don’t understand the holes I’ve punched in the wall, the phones I’ve smashed, the scars I still have to this day and I feel so fucking alone. 

I know a lot of people suffering haven’t done the bat shit things I’ve done, no alcohol poisoning nor deliberate overdoses—something as stupid as Russian roulette with a revolver. But I feel like I’m treated like a junkie than I am Bipolar, despite the 75% of the crazy shit being sober. I’m just treated like I’m subhuman because of the things I’ve done manic/depressed and nothing more. Like Bipolar isn’t something that can go so far overboard to lead to those kind of decisions. I can’t relate to anyone and no one can relate to me and choose to belittle my experience and say I have bigger issues than what I know I have.

2025-11-05 11:07:26;Hi all!;"I have had a bipolar diagnosis on and off my entire life. For some reason no one has ever been able to say for sure. No clue why. However, after years of just thinking it’s anxiety and depression….and making little to no progress with my old psychiatrist, I let that practice and went to someone new.

Yesterday she did an extreme work up (which I appreciate.) the thing is, she’s pretty certain I have Bipolar 2. My brain has been spinning since because she wants me to come back in 2 weeks to discuss our next options and what I think after doing research on it and the potential medication she would put me on.

I guess I’m just trying to look for a support community that can help me guide through this new experience.

Three weeks ago, I was officially diagnosed with bipolar 2. It feels kind of surreal after a year of not knowing what exactly was up and wondering if I was making it all up, but I am happy to be diagnosed. Forever grateful that my therapist caught it because otherwise, I wouldn't have had the faintest idea to seek out the help/assessment I needed, mainly because I already had a diagnosis that felt ""accurate"".

Thankfully though, because I've been living with that ""maybe"" of having bipolar 2, I've done quite a bit of research into it (triggers, symptom management, etc) so, despite the diagnosis being new, dealing with it isn't.

The idea of being medicated it is pretty daunting though, as I've had a bad experience with finding the right SSRI for my anxiety (for which i no longer meet the diagnosic criteria!! yayy!!) but I'll figure that out as my treatment goes on. My next appointment is on November 21st, my first at the bipolar clinic of the hospital, so I'll probably make an update after that too.

All that to say, I'm finally diagnosed with bipolar 2 and it is such a relief to know that I wasn't making it up and that there was something wrong. :)";r/bipolar2;4;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ooqbdj/sooo_little_update/

2025-11-05 09:13:26;My grandfather died and now I’m having a severe episode;"Diagnosed bipolar 2 10 years ago. Been having pretty bad episodes lately, but after my grandfather passed away last Friday, I’ve really lost my shit. He was in the hospital the last week of his life, and being his POA, I made all the decisions for him. My grandfather really only just had me. His one and only daughter (my mom obvi) passed away in 2012. 

He died within 30 minutes of the hospital calling to tell me they were discharging him for home, and they took him off of pain medication that day without my consent. I just know he died in severe pain.

I can’t stop obsessing over the events, replaying them in my mind, I’ve been drinking a lot and it’s made me super volatile. I broke up with my fiancé, and we’ve been together almost 7 years. I’m just really losing my shit. Even though I’m on medication for bipolar it hasn’t truly been that effective. I don’t know what part of me is grief or the bipolar? A similar thing happened to me when my fiancés dad died last year. I went absolutely batshit crazy. And I’m not sure if the grief brought up the bipolar episode? Or if everything has just been a long time coming. I’m so confused and messed up. I didn’t sleep for a few days, and now I can barely get out of bed. 

Death and grief have played a huge role in my psyche over the past 15 years. And it’s triggering more and more each time someone passes away. I’ve been in therapy, but it’s not really helping. 

Anyone else been through something similar? Just want to feel like I’m not completely alone.

2025-11-05 09:06:48;mania without euphoria? trying to understand why i was diagnosed (tw sh);"Hi- I (20NB) have been unwell since I was 12, with main issues being emotional dysregulation and self-harm. After being discharged from CAMHS at 18 I sought private support and eventually saw a psychiatrist last year, who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1- but the problem is my symptoms don't seem to match up with Bipolar 1, and additionally every other psychiatrist I saw whilst still in CAMHS heavily disagreed with the idea of Bipolar (it was frequently brought up by mum due to extensive family history).



I do not have manic episodes in the traditional sense. I definitely do have days where I'm hyper, out of control, impulsive and euphoric, but this feeling never lasts longer than a day. However, maybe 4-5 times a year I'll experience extreme mental health episodes, lasting at least a month, where I'll be depressed, heavily abuse substances, ritualistically self-harm, be stupid, stay up for 24-48 hours at a time before crashing for 20 and repeating, lose all my money etc. Could these be considered manic episodes even though it's missing the euphoria? The psych I saw never bothered to explain why he thought I was Bipolar beyond the family history and that I have always reacted poorly to antidepressants (they mess with my mood). Before seeing this psych, I was working under the impression I most likely had undiagnosed BPD, which lines up with previous psychiatrists' statements along with the fact that I previously completed 12 months of DBT which was the first time anything helped my brain EVER. 



Anyway- does this experience sound similiar to anyone else? I can't seem to find anyone who's had experiences like me, at least not Bipolar, I have a few friends from DBT with BPD who have similar experiences.";r/bipolar;8;7;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oop8ip/mania_without_euphoria_trying_to_understand_why_i/
2025-11-05 08:24:00;Struggling with spirituality and Bipolar;"I have been a practicing witch for a very long time, and I understand that people have differing opinions and biases against that but bear with me here. 

After having a BAD manic episode that lasted 4 months, and left me in an incredible amount of debt, without a job, and out of a longterm relationship (which ended up being a good decision, actually) i basically regained consciousness, realized I needed help, and have been stabilizing since August, and in DBT for my BPD. I got diagnosed with Bipolar and BPD at the same time.

I consider my spirituality to be a strong trait of mine. I practice in prayer to the earth and universe, tarot readings, meditation, and some spellwork (candle/burning rituals, baths, letters, incantations, etc). A lot of this has been passed down to me by my mom and grandmother, so it holds some cultural significance to me.

I guess my question is, where's the line? How do I know my spirituality is bringing me real comfort and I'm not having religious psychosis (again)? Is there a way to balance these without triggering an episode, or an episode causing me to believe in some spiritual grandiosity?

2025-11-05 07:27:30;Newly diagnosed, starting Lamictal-nervous!;"Hi all! 31F
After years of suspecting, and a Registered Nurse sister who has gently pushed me to seek professional treatment, I was officially diagnosed Bipolar 2 yesterday. 

My primary doctor has been bringing up the topic for some time, and finally referred me to psych whom found it surprising I hadn’t been diagnosed sooner! Anywho, I’ve been on Desvenlafaxine now for about a year and a half. And I do feel like it has given me a little more time between the really bad lows. Before this, I had tried many meds and SSRIs that either did nothing or gave me horrible side effects. And Wellbutrin which sent me into full blown psychosis with horrible ideations. 

We are keeping my Desvenlafaxine and adding Lamictal (lamotrigine) starting at 25mg, she’s hoping to titrate up to 150mg and see how I feel. I’m a little nervous starting a new med because I’ve had poor experiences so many times. But I hear Lamictal can be a miracle drug for many. 

If you’re on Lamictal, how did it help you? How long did it take for you to start noticing a difference? 
Grateful for stories and advice, and more than anything grateful not to be alone here. Thank you all <3

2025-11-05 06:10:05;Do I go to a hospital or..?;"So earlier today I made a post called 'I made a plan' so im not really going to reiterate too much you can just check it out. But basically ive been in a depressive episode for a couple months. im getting started on lamictal its just taking a while because we have to titrate up. but today I just kinda lost all hope. this is the first time i actually made a plan, and if it werent for the fact that I was stuck at school I would have..i dont know. maybe been dead or just hurt. I dont know if I would have really gone through with it or just did it half way.

Some people suggested I go to the hospital, which..to be honest I agree with.

but..and yes there is a but..my parents do not believe in my diagnosis, my car is broken down, and i am broke (19F). they have mocked me about my diagnosis, purposefully triggered me. and i think all of this rejection is just..they dont want that stain in the blood. like theyll support mental health etc for people outside of the family..but not in the family. since i was 15 i begged for a therapist and the farthest i ever got was a free student in training to become a therapist. safe to say they werent equipped because they were dealing with undiagnosed bipolar 1.

Anyway, I feel like if i went to the hospital id just end up using the rest of the little money i had, id get shit from my parents..a shit ton..which to be fucking honest might just send me right back to the hospital! I wouldnt be able to get there without them driving me.

ive calmed down a bit for a couple hours ago..then i was all snotty and bawling in public. now..i dont know how to describe it. like my brain quite literally feels sick. im sitting in a fog, etc. has anyone else ever felt physically sick in their brains? i know you cant technically feel your brain but still.

  
just update: my mom is currently downstairs on the phone complaining to me dad about how..i dont even know the word..self absorbed? because I went and started her car to get the frost off. i dont know. im literally just tr fuck her. just fuck her lol. shes a goddamn bitch and shes been a bitch forever";r/BipolarReddit;2;15;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ookyr3/do_i_go_to_a_hospital_or/

SSRI’s is a no go. I’ve tried Abilify and made my SI really bad. Wellbutrin was the worst medication I’ve ever been on and made my chest hurt and gave me a panic attack every day. I’ve been on Lurasidone 20mg for over a year and tried increasing to 40mg and made things worse so went back down. I need something to pair with the Lurasidone cause it’s not doing it on its own anymore so did Lamotrigine and got the worst migraines. I do get stress migraines and wonder if I’m just under a lot of stress but went back down to 25mg from 75mg and the migraines went away since then. My next options my psych gave me are lithium and Vraylar and both terrify me. Lithium for many of reasons like toxicity, thyroid, etc and Vraylar cause it’s so expensive and I’ve read that it’s not great for anxiety which im already struggling with. I feel limited on options cause I’m struggling with weight and body issues so my psych is really only giving me weight neutral options yet I read people gain alot of weight on lithium so idk. I’m also very sensitive to medication in general

2025-11-05 02:08:24;the few days after an attempt feels awful;"I don't know who to talk to about this, so here it goes. I'm diagnosed Bipolar 1 and DID. Two days ago, I had a suicide attempt—I tried to overdose on my psych medications but an alter managed to front before I got the chance to drink those pills. A few days has passed and it just feels.. weird? 

It's like life goes on, and you start to realize that the people around you will never know that you would've been gone for good unless you tell them. My internship and work moved forward with the tasks, as if I didn't have that crisis from that weekend; My friends all talk the same way; My mom still greets me in the morning; My dog is still here. These things made me realize what might've happened if that attempt actually succeeded—what if my alter wasn't there.

I feel so selfish. I didn't even think that attempt through—it was an impulsive decision if I'm being honest. I didn't even think about what my loved ones would've went through, the expenses they would've had to deal with if I were to have a funeral, the emotional burden I would've been if I was just gone.

Lately I feel as if I'm doing everything I can to distract myself, but I know that I can't keep running away any longer. It's not that the feelings are too overwhelming to address, but rather it's the feeling of being so empty and hollow after said attempt. It feels like life has no point. I'm here, so now what? I don't want to die either, but I just wish this episode would be over soon.

Rest assured, I've had a session earlier with my therapist and another upcoming session with my psychiatrist this Saturday. I'm doing everything I can to cope and keep myself safe—but GOD I'm so tired, and I'm blank.";r/bipolar;9;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ooeitb/the_few_days_after_an_attempt_feels_awful/

I would rage out on my husband for the smallest things, I’m shocked he’s stuck around sometimes.

I used copilot to make easier to read but it’s all me 😉 And this is a new account but I’m not new to Reddit.  Need a safe account to talk about personal stuff. 

This will be the year I accept my condition. And honestly, it’s impossible to put all these emotions into words.

I just started a new medication (month ago), and for the first time in months, I can feel my body relaxing. It’s surreal. I can finally describe what “manic” feels like—something I never could before.

I was diagnosed five years ago (at 34). I didn’t understand it then, and I fought it hard. I chased every alternative, begged for a different label. But second and fifth opinions all said the same thing.

I wish I could go back and choose a different path to get here. Quitting my meds was reckless, but maybe it was the wake-up call I needed. The consequences of stopping bipolar medication after five years—without any doctor oversight—are brutal. It’s not just a depressive spell. It’s a full-on physical and mental attack.

Hospital visits. A months-long episode. All of it forced me to face the truth: this is my condition. I can keep fighting it and let life suck. Or I can embrace it and do my best.

My job, my relationships—they’ve all taken hits. And yeah, it hurts. But I keep asking: did they quit me, or did I quit them?

I’m choosing to do better. For me. Because I love me.

I’ve walked the dark road. But I want to finish 2025 on a positive, hopeful note. And maybe this post is part of that.

2025-11-04 17:03:11;Pshychiatrist and therapist disagree on possible diagnosis?;"Hi everyone!

Wanted to ask what would you do in this situation?:


For context, I’m currently seeing both a psychiatrist (at an outpatient psychiatric clinic) and a psychotherapist. The main issue is that my therapist and psychiatrist disagree about the possibility of me having bipolar disorder. I’ve only been seeing both for a short while since my therapy has just started, and so has my treatment relationship with the psychiatric clinic.

The reason I doubt that I have bipolar disorder is that I haven’t had any symptoms for a long time. For example, even though I’ve stopped taking my medication, I’ve heard that people who stop their meds usually experience mania or hypomania — but for me, it’s only led to depression.

My first experiences happened a couple of years ago when I was in high school. I had started taking sertraline, and suddenly I felt boundless energy and began hearing and seeing hallucinations. I saw floating gray faces everywhere, and white and black figures following me. I thought I was the most beautiful person in the world. I spent €7,000 on a diamond bracelet and got myself a sugar daddy. I felt extremely impulsive and “invincible,” euphoric even. I didn’t sleep at all, or if I did, it was only for about three hours. I became intensely focused on things for hours or days at a time. My thoughts were racing, and I talked over people. Others said I didn’t seem like myself. That state lasted for about a month.

The same thing happened when I started bupropion. Nowadays, when I told my psychiatrist about these symptoms, she said it might not actually meet the criteria for bipolar disorder. She prescribed me a small dose of aripiprazole (2.5–5 mg) alongside venlafaxine. I’ve been stable for a year now and feel good.

When I described these symptoms to my therapist, she said they sounded typical of bipolar type II disorder, but my psychiatrist disagrees and says it doesn’t meet the diagnostic criteria. Both are very experienced in their fields, so I don’t know what to believe or what to do.

However, such a small dose probably wouldn’t be enough to truly stabilize my mood, so I’m starting to doubt that I even have bipolar disorder. On the other hand, my psychiatrist mentioned that I’m unusually sensitive to medications, and that even small doses have worked for me in the past.

What would you do? ";r/bipolar2;9;16;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oo2ndv/pshychiatrist_and_therapist_disagree_on_possible/

2025-11-04 13:46:31;Adderall with BPD2, irritation;so i’m going to try and keep this short. i’m on lamictal 200 mg and have not had a bipolar episode since december 5th 2022. However when I stated back to college august 2023 it came to my attention that not being able to sit down and concentrate was a big deal. I got away with it in highschool so I went through the show shabang and got a full psych evaluation. ADHD was diagnosed. They tried several things ritalin caused me to have a mixed episode lasted about 3-4 ish days. So then they tried me on a non stimulant Quelbree it caused God awful consitpaiton I was having to eat laxatives everyday and the effect wasn’t worth it. Finally he said that most of his bipolar patients did great in a lose dose adderall. 10 mg did a tad bit something he bumped it to 15 mg and it caused depression that lasted the rest of the day once it wore off after about 4 doses, the depression stopped. Now pause: my bipolar mania is anger, explosive, irritation. For the first 8 weeks of school I took it the 2 days I had class. Well this next 8 weeks of semester I have classes 4 days a week. I took it 4 days in a row last week and I noticed I couldn’t handle stress and my emotions as well. Not mania by any means but it definitely was a hint of how I felt before the lamictal. I am going to contact my doctor but wanted to see if it was normal for a more frequent dose to cause this for a while. Did it happen to you? Did it go away? and my doctor stated last monthly check up that if I was concerned we could go on a small dose of lithium to allow the mania to now come running a muck.

2025-11-04 12:42:50;Is BP2 manageable without medication?;"I want to make it clear before I make this post that I’m not anti-medication, and I think that the vast majority of people with mental disorders would benefit from accepting medication. This is just based on my experience.

I’m an 18M, and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 around 6 months ago or so. For a long time now, both before and after my diagnosis, I’ve been on and off many meds, whether they be for depression, my comorbid ADHD, or more recently to manage manic episodes. And without fail, every single time, I react horribly. I always get so dizzy I can’t drive safely, or so emotionless and empty I’m nearly catatonic, or something else horrible. 

I understand that sometimes meds can have nasty side effects and sometimes it’s necessary to push through them but every time I just can’t do it. I don’t know if I’m just weak and not strong willed enough but all I know is I just can’t. Maybe I’m not weak since when I describe these symptoms to my psychiatrist she always immediately suggests I stop taking it, but I don’t know. The only medication that I actively take that doesn’t always make me feel horrible is my Adderall, but ofc even with that I need to be careful cause the first time I got it it triggered an episode.

I also find myself continuously and rapidly changing my opinion on meds, going from “I should never take them they’re not gonna work for me” to “I need meds right now, it’s dangerous to go without them.” I just don’t know what’s right for me. Is my brain just sensitive to meds for some reason? I just want to know if it’s possible to manage BP2 without medication, or if it’s an absolute necessity. Any success stories with/without medication would be cool to hear. And I’m not asking for specific medical advice ofc just if it’s theoretically possible and any personal experience you guys have.

(Also I didn’t know whether to tag this as “advice wanted” or “medication question” so sorry if it’s mislabeled)

2025-11-04 10:26:23;Does anyone else constantly gaslight themselves?;"I have a diagnosis of Bipolar 2, CPTSD, and ADHD. I was diagnosed at 34 and I’m now 36 (37 in January) and I haven’t had a drink since April because it makes my bipolar so much worse — but when I’m not self medicating, I am always overanalyzing every single feeling and thought and instinct I have. I feel like I am CONSTANTLY at war with myself and I’ve felt this way for several years… even before my diagnosis because I knew I wasn’t “normal” and that my anxiety could be extreme - and I didn’t know anyone else who would shut down like I did as I started to get out of high school. A lot of details about my life are strange and not relatable to most people I’ve met which makes me feel insecure and even more insane. But when someone I love is doing something to me that I know I wouldn’t do to them and I try to talk to them about my feelings - it often ends up being turned and twisted in a way that makes me feel worse for even having feelings. 
Or in situations where I know something either did or didn’t happen, but they’re telling me the opposite and saying my memory isn’t reliable (my brain is scattered at times but not 24/7) — I don’t know what to do.
I go back and forth between trying to defend myself because I logically know that *my* genuine truth is just as important as theirs. But I also feel like it’s my responsibility to hold space for their feelings and perceived reality as well. 
So I go back and forth from apologizing for upsetting them to defending my feelings and it’s just exhausting. 
I’ve gotten into some really unfortunate situations and relationships because I’ve ignored my gut and my truth telling myself it was just me being mentally ill. 
And sometimes I go through phases where I push so much down to avoid confrontation until I can’t anymore which can become a cycle and is so bad for my mental health. 
I just don’t know what’s valid or what’s not.

so i was diagnosed two years ago and was prescribed lamotrigine. it has been wonderful for me, and i am currently taking 200mg. 

my last psych check in and prescription refill was last early november. i ended up moving temporarily moving mexico a couple weeks after, and was able to get lamotrigine over the counter-costing me about $3/month for my dosage so i stopped psych check ins. 

(i kept my regular appointments with my therapist and we monitored my moods and we thought my dosage was appropriate. if i felt the need to reach out to my psych, i wouldn’t hesitate to and my therapist has all his contact information.)

when i had to come back USA, i stocked up and bought a years worth. i am finally down to my last few days worth of medication and have an appointment with a new psychiatrist tomorrow.

so my concern/question is: since i haven’t had a check-up or done a refill in a year, will the doctor believe me and give me a refill for my normal 200mg?


i really depend on this medication and i am scared what will happen if i have to go some days without it or have to lower my dose.

2025-11-04 09:45:17;Adderall and Bipolar.;"Hi Reddit, I’m trying to understand something about bipolar disorder and stimulants. I’ve been recently diagnosed and I’ve had a past episodes where antidepressants caused elevated mood, insomnia, irritability and so many other symptoms. it was severe enough I almost needed hospitalization because I couldn’t sleep at all. This happens every time and sometimes it can be very bad, even with one small dose, each time different antidepressants but low doses. Even sumatriptan did that (I didn’t know it has serotonin and took it for a migraine attack and got hospitalized because I thought I was having a heart attack and wanted to argue with everyone in the ER because I thought they were watching me). 
I do not take any mood stabilizers currently. 
I’ve noticed that my focus is very sharp normally, no hyperactivity, and no signs of ADHD from childhood to now. 
But I’m very curious about what happens if someone like me takes Adderall or other stimulants.
Does everyone with bipolar react negatively?
How quickly might a reaction (hypomania/mania/mixed episodes) show up?
Are there cases where people tolerate stimulants without triggering mania, even when not on a stabilizer?
If every bipolar person reacts the same to antidepressants or stimulants, why can’t doctors use them as a tool to diagnose? 
I’m not planning to self medicate, I just want to understand real world experiences from people who have bipolar and have tried stimulants. 
Any insights or personal stories are appreciated.

2025-11-04 08:58:41;you are more than your bipolar disorder;"i always thought I am bipolar for a year now, but was not ready for a diagnosis as I have always been afraid of the stigma surrounding it. I always thought that once I got diagnosed, I would be defined by my diagnosis and people around me would treat me in a way like I am solely ""that guy who is bipolar"".

Feeling very lost lately and found no joy in anything. One of my coping mechanisms would be to look for meetups/hookups. Then I met this girl through a local subreddit who is 4 years younger than me. She was pretty, dressed well, and very articulate. I have met few individuals with such intellectual and emotional depth and I was magnetized how she dissects any topic with analytical rigor, that I forgot the purpose of our meetup. 

Somewhere along the lines of our convo, she opened up that she was bipolar, and honestly, I was shocked and wouldnt have thought of her to be someone that a condition that I think I have. Now, this girl talked openly about the condition: how she initially thought she was bipolar before diagnosis, her manic episodes, how to deal with it and how people would and should support somone during these episodes.

I was ashamed deep inside to be self-diagnosing and trying to bottle it in and feel guilty without being even sure if I do have it, yet this amazing woman who is a diagnosed bipolar fights with her internal struggles everyday but still remains to be a kind, witty, and thoughtful person all while being a student in the medical field under such long hours and stress. I looked up to her as someone so inspirational and how she sets an example of someone is so much more than their diagnosis, quashing any personal stigma I had for the condition. 

We ended up spending the whole night up to early morning mostly just driving around the city, then parking somewhere to have deep conversations. I was the older guy, yet the way she has so much knowledge and passion for every little topic and interest we talked about, felt like she had way more years of experience and IQ ahead of me.

Im not sure if im gonna be able to meet her again, but I was and will always be thankful to the universe  for making her cross paths with me and giving me the courage to get diagnosed and most importantly, change my perspective. Whether the results confirm if I have it or not, one thing is for sure:  a person is definitely more than their bipolar disorder.

I left my spouse a few months ago in what I now realise was the middle of an episode. I’d been manic for months beforehand but didn’t recognise it. I was diagnosed with bipolar about a week before I left. Around that time I also started having what I now think were paranoid or psychotic thoughts about my spouse - things that felt totally real then, and honestly, still partly do.

I did something similar once before. I had a previous episode with psychosis that also targeted my spouse. I think I probably scared them a lot both times, especially with what I said and believed about them.

When I left this time, I did it by email. I haven’t seen or spoken to my spouse since. They’ve reached out a few times and said they love me and want to reconnect but I haven’t responded. We were married and living together with our kids from previous relationships, but there hasn’t been any contact at all since I left, not even for the kids.

I’m not on medication right now as I didn’t like how it felt and I didn’t really believe the diagnosis. I don’t think I feel manic or psychotic anymore. I actually feel fine. But I keep wondering if I did the wrong thing, or if I should try to reach out. I just don’t really know what “fine” means anymore.

Has anyone else gone through something like this…leaving someone during an episode, especially after psychosis, and then trying to make sense of it later?

My life consists of waking up every morning with pain all over my body, wanting to die, and assuming I'm going to have a terrible day. I'm always in bed, and I go weeks without showering (my mother has to insist I do it; I care so little about myself that I'm incapable of doing that for myself). Brushing my teeth is also a struggle (they've started to hurt, lol). I've attempted suicide about seven times in the last three years, always using non-violent methods that I no longer have access to (medication controlled by my mother).

2025-11-04 04:13:35;Will he come back to me? Or am I gaslighting myself?;"I cannot properly express in words how much I'm struggling right now. I'm not really sure where to start, so I'm just gonna give you some backstory to our relationship and what's currently going on, so I apologize if this seems long.

We're both 32, and have been together for 5 years, and lived together a little over 4. He's former military, recently getting out earlier this year, the same time he got his BP diagnosis. This is important to know, since he bases a very large part of his self worth on having a successful career and being educated. We survived a 6 month deployment together on top of 1 month deployments a couple times year. We moved cross country together in 2023.

We started having significant issues after our move, but did have some trouble prior. He's fearful avoidant and is overstimulated by being touched, so he's very uncomfortable with affection and compliments. After our move, he began using me as his emotional punching bag. He didn't care about how he made me feel. I hurt my knee pretty badly at my job and couldn't work for over a year while I did some intense PT, while also having 2 unrelated emergency surgeries, one of which was a life saving surgery, and I also got diagnosed with a chronic pain condition. I was doing online college classes until I ran out of money. He was incredibly frustrated at my lack of financial success and having to support me. I do feel a lot of guilt and shame for it, and tried really hard to find a job that would accommodate my needs. I didn't just sit around and do nothing, I did all the household chores (which was a lot because he was a slob) and managed all our shopping and appointments. We went to couples therapy twice, with improvement after the first time, but all progress went out the window after one of his month long deployments. Second time was after he got out of the military and got diagnosed with BP, and it went downhill from there.

After an internship he had failed to turn into a job, he became hypomanic. He was volatile and terrifying, picking nonsensical fights with me and giving me the cold shoulder when he felt unfairly criticized after a therapy session. He got a little better this summer after taking a few long weekends away to unwind. We made the decision to make another cross country move, closer to my family who we would stay with until we found a new apartment. We stopped in his hometown on the way, where he was excited to show me everything and introduce me to his grandma and his childhood best friend.

He got a new job that turned out to not be what he expected-- having an entry level job was a big blow to his self esteem, and became obsessive trying to find something that would utilize his skillset and would be frantic about his finances. I became the emotional punching bag again, so late August, we had a conversation about how he was treating me, where we discussed living separately and working on things. It was never explicitly stated we were breaking up.

So imagine my surprise 3 weeks ago when I find out we ARE broken up. During that time between August and then we continued kissing, saving I love you, etc. I never had an inkling we were broken up. We didn't speak for a week, but made up when he broke the silence and apologized. We spoke every day, and last week I stayed over for 4 nights while I was unable to stay at my parents place for a few days. While there, I found glitter and blonde hair all over my pillow, and a used condom in the trash can. I felt like the air was sucked out of my lungs. I had only just found out we were broken up, and now he was already seeing someone, while claiming he still loves and cares about me and that there's potential to get back together in the future.

Keep in mind, this is extremely baffling because all my shit is everywhere. The letterboard in the kitchen says I love you on it still, the little hearts I drew still on the whiteboard on the fridge, and a box of all our mementos is sitting in the living room. My toiletries are even in his bathroom and our dog's (who lives me) stuff is everywhere too! All the streaming services on the TV have a profile with my picture, so you see it whenever you use one. I can't wrap my head around him moving on so quickly, let alone with someone who HAS to be aware that I'm still in his life in this capacity. We hashed it out a little bit, him claiming he still loved and cared about me and wasn't rushing into any relationships right now because it didn't feel right. He spoiled me while I was over, making me dinner, rubbing muscle balm on me, buying me treats, and sleeping in bed with me every night (no sex). I'm fucking stupid, I know. The cherry on top is last Saturday he stayed on the phone with me for an hour and half when I had a bad reaction to a medication. I found out the person he was seeing stayed the night when an Amazon order he had me make had her car in the delivery photo. He took me out to breakfast the next morning too, so he had to have kicked her out to see me.  

It wasn't until last night when he came over to make me dinner that the alarm bells fully went off. He expressed to me he wanted to quit his job and fuck off for a while. While he has the financial ability to do so, this is INSANELY out of character for him. I started to connect the dots-- he was making sure every moment of his free time was occupied with friends or clubs when not hanging out with me, he claimed he wasn't sleeping in the bed on nights he was alone, he's been drinking a lot, and he's been smoking weed with this woman he's seeing despite the fact that it makes him feel worse. I'm worried he may be hypomanic right now and he's going to crash and burn and do something extreme when that happens. Or maybe I'm fooling myself and this is what he wants for his life. I truly don't know anymore.

I'm trying so hard to give him space and work on myself. I know I wasn't the best partner and lost myself in my own chronic illness for a long time. I wish I tried harder, and am trying really hard to be better. I want him back so badly, and it scares me that he seems to burying himself in things until he can't anymore. He's going to therapy, but he's been going for a while with no improvement. I don't think his meds are working either. What do I do? Will he come back?

2025-11-04 04:08:26;Realities of medications;"Trigger: suicide and self harm



Hi all

I, 26F, was originally diagnosed with bipolar around age 14. I was never treated with medications outside of an antidepressant (Prozac, which lead to a huge overdose)

I’m now in my mid 20s and going through quite a severe deep patch. After an admission to the mental health ward last week, they recommended quetiapine to help me sleep, and gave me 3 days of tablets- I took it the first night and it seemed ok, so I saw my GP about going a longer trial. I now have a week supply to try, and an appointment to see the GP in 6 days 

I’ve asked him about side affects and he’s basically said twitching and sleepiness, but I’m wondering what your experiences were? What side affects did you get and how soon did they happen? 

I’ve taken my first dose of the trial medications last night and can’t tell if it’s causing some side effects already or if I’m just losing my mind 😂 nothing major yet- but my appetite seems to be quite high suddenly. 

Thankyou all! ";r/BipolarReddit;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1onmgl6/realities_of_medications/
2025-11-04 04:03:30;Do Successful relationships with BP1 exist? If so have any Tips?;"I’ll start off with I’m not sure If I’m allowed in the space / community so if not disregard and sorry for the trouble.

I’m a (27F) with BP1 and my long term (8 year) boyfriend (28M) have had trouble navigating my recent diagnosis.

History:
I’ve had a really fucked up childhood with neglect / abuse from my mom and SA from my uncle so my partner and I always assumed my behaviour, emotions and lack of coping to sudden life changes was cause of this. Since I was 17 I blew up my life about every 5-4 years but it usually was just moving on from friend groups / career changes / going back to school cause I wanted a “fresh start” and lots of crying. All things my partner supported me through 100%. Well 2 years ago after having a very significant negative life change things got bad. I had life ruining week and a half, filled with impulsive risky behaviours, binge drinking, financial irresponsibility, and inevitably  another SA. - I didn’t even recognize my self when I was reflecting back. In this time the environment I was in. They kept telling me I was fun and that my concerned Boyfriend was controlling and “doesnt get me” so I broke up with him out of the blue (but we were 4 months engaged) and did all this crazy shit, after the assault and the calling off the engagement I went back to sleep with that person willingly but at the time my BF never agreed to us breaking up was trying to get me help but I pushed him so we both look back at it as an affair. When I understood the weight of my actions it all crashed down with a Suicide attempt and that’s when my BF came back and picked up the pieces. I got a BP1 diagnosis and everything changed. I’m medicated for 2 years now, see a therapist, couples therapist and a sex therapist (there was always issues since the first SA), I got my job to switch to regular hours instead of shift work to help regulate my sleep and and I quit drugs 2 years and cut back a lot on drinking (working on sober). 

Now two years later we are in this middle ground of where things feel normal again and we are talking about futures trying to get back to that picture of marriage, house, kids. But I’m scared. I’m so scared I’m gonna hurt him again and that the decisions I make will one day not be “my own”. He was so hurt and traumatized. I’m traumatized. I’ve become obsessed the idea of stability that anything remotely “unstable” scares me to the point where I think it’s starting to negatively affect the relationship.  there are still waves of emotions / arguments that we have learned to ride (but still definitely strains him and an apology can only do so much). I have made Many contingency plans to prevent mania (my partner has the final say on if he thinks I’m becoming unwell and then I am expected to call in sick to work take a prescribed medication that puts me to sleep for like 18 ours, and if necessary going to a psych unit. Which brings me to my questions.

-my boyfriend has done drugs / drinking recreationally and there has never been a problem he’s very social, it doesn’t cause harm to the relationship and I don’t feel pressured to do the same when around him, but these environments scares me. It’s too similar to the bad environment I was in, the partying types scare me and I just automatically associated drugs (he does molly maybe twice a year) with instability. I told him that him doing drugs makes me feel uncomfortable - but it is ultimately a me problem and I feel bad taking away his fun / sociability because I it triggers me. Is this a fair ask to stop drugs when prior to the manic episode I was okay with it?

-second. this thread is full of ExSOs (justifiably so) and I’m wondering if a long term relationship is even possible with BP1. I don’t want to have a family just to blow it up one day. I feel like that’s a serious consideration on my part because my BF said he still wants this so it feels like I have to decide for the both of us. Sometimes I have that tiny voice in my head that says break up and 99% of the time I know it’s an unreasonable reaction to a minor relationship inconvenience. But that 1% of the time I think it’s almost better for him if we do and I don’t think that indecision is not fair to him. Could this relationship work? If you had a successful one what was a 100% must do for the relationship to stay stable.

Now I guess I'm ok. That's it. I'm functional, not self destructive, not grandiose. I'm cleaning my manic bs and I've reasonable plan for the future. 
I know why we stop our med, stability is so frustrating and boring. I get anxious for stupid shit at work and I can't fuck me up with substances to forget about it or plan a new super cool project to escape. I feel lonely but I don't contact my ex toxic girlfriends for a short and toxic moment of confort. 
My impulsive behavior are just thoughts now, they go away. I'm better at getting my shit together when I freak out. I'm not angry anymore. My psychiatrist and my mom thinks I'm better. So that's it, I take my pills, I make peace with the path and move on. All that shit, being diagnosed, accepting it, recognizing up and down, trying meds, stopping meds, relapse, sides effects, rapid cycling, obsession with symptoms etc... To end up baseline human, dealing with basic adult life. It's not like I was waiting for a medal but in my head for the last decades being fine used to mean being hypomanic and/or loaded, so I'm still confuse whit that narcissistic grandiose ass hole I thought I was. The journey for remission and stability of bipolar doesn't make a good story. All that pain and energy trying to find a way to be ""normal"".

Sorry for venting, i encourage all of you to get help and to seek for that grey feeling of stability because mania can seems fun but it's destructive and inevitably followed by deep depression. All of that shit get worth with time, during my twenties hypomania was under the radar but in my thirties that was way more dangerous and destructive for me and my entourage.

I feel a lot better now that I’m medicated but I’m just wondering about getting paid time off for something like this. I live in a state that offers paid FMLA but I asked a doctor about getting time off because I was in a terrible spot and already missing a lot of work and he straight up told me I can’t get this approved. I trusted it even though I was mad but I’m just curious if he might have not known what he was talking about.

This doctor seemed annoyed with me because he wasn’t my primary care doctor but I didn’t have a primary doctor yet because I was forced to change insurance because my work changed insurances on me and in turn also forced me to change doctors mid diagnosis. 

Was he wrong about that? Could I have taken time off for this and avoided a severe melt down I had a month later? Also. Did the company I work for screw me over by not giving out enough information? I had no idea going into the insurance meeting that I had to change doctors. It was 3 or so months ago this happened and didn’t really think anything of it but I’ve been feeling alot better and thinking alot clearer and it’s bringing up some important questions lol.

I was diagnosed a good almost 15 years ago with bipolar, and I've learned a lot about how to make myself a priority in terms of self-care and med management. I also learned to choose my friends wisely concerning this illness, and not give my trust and heart to just anyone. I've gotten too many slow fades and ghosts as a result. 

I've also learned to be much more empathetic to those who are struggling mentally. While I can draw clear boundaries and look out for my own well-being, I can still love and care about others who need extra help. 

Now, I'm learning to accept all of myself more, including this illness. I love myself regardless.

Taking 175mg right now, and I’ve tried the patch and progesterone only pill prior to surgery.

I lasted 2 months on the patch but only 2 days on the pill. My gyno recommended we try orlissa post op (only for 6 months) but because it induces temporary menopause, I wanted to see if anyone has had experience trying it in combination with bipolar meds, or can speak on the mental health impact in general.

I have been diagnosed with bp2 about 2 years ago, have been taking lamotrigine and it worked wonders. I have been prescribed an adhd stimulant (elvanse I think, my recipe is at the pharmacy and I haven't picked up my meds yet) for my potential adhd. I have read that you are not supposed to take stimulants if you have bipolar disorder, so I'm a little nervous around that idea. But at the same time, my adhd symptoms are debilitating and I feel exhausted almost all the time. 
People who are diagnosed with both, what is your experience with stimulants?

Update: I've taken it once yesterday and I am impressed. I thought it would maybe improve my attention a little or help me cancel out stimuli but it did so much more. I never realised how many problems I actually had (restlesness, impatience) since I've taken them. The side effects are a little meh (muscle pain, blurry vision and insomnia, a little heart palpitation here and there).

By June, he had completely exploded our life. He was diagnosed as bipolar, but did not accept his diagnosis and didn’t think he needed help. It was a living nightmare and my husband turned into a monster. 

I filed for divorce in July, I moved out, we sold our beautiful house, and both went our separate ways. We recently got into contact because there are some remaining issues with the house we have to discuss. 

My husband is finally coming out of his manic episode and has realized the destruction that he caused. It’s really horrible because this is the first time in months that I feel like I’m talking to my husband and not a demonic entity. He thinks that he’s going to get me back and I keep telling him there’s no way. He traumatized me so much that there’s no way I could ever look at him the same way plus I would always be concerned about another episode, especially since he doesn’t want to take meds. 

I also think that we have two different realities of what happened. He’s still making little comments about how I was his wife and I abandoned him. I don’t think he realizes the severity of some of the things he was doing.
 
I’m just really sad. And now I have to see him in person this week to sign some documents. I miss him so much. And it’s hard not to feel regret for giving up on my husband.

2025-11-03 22:57:37;ADHD and bipolar disorder.;"ADHD medication and bipolar disorder?

Has anyone here been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar disorder?
If so, were you able to keep your ADHD medication after starting treatment for bipolar disorder?

I was diagnosed with ADHD around the same time my doctor started suspecting bipolar disorder — both by the same doctor — when I was 14 years old. During my ADHD assessment, the doctor noted in my records that bipolar disorder should be investigated as soon as possible.

However, after finishing 8th grade, I had to move to another city, and my whole care team changed. I tried to bring up the importance of doing the bipolar assessment at every appointment, but it was completely ignored. Eventually, I got so frustrated with the whole situation that I convinced myself therapy wasn’t that important anymore — except for getting my ADHD medication renewed.

When I was 15, my behavior and symptoms got much worse. I went through my first manic episode, which lasted about 3–6 months, and during that time I started using substances more heavily. When the episode ended, I fell into deep depression and self-loathing, and I ended up dropping out of school and isolating myself socially.

At that point, I had been taking ADHD medication (methylphenidate / Ritalin-type medication) regularly for about 1.5 years, and it had helped me a lot in school — I even managed to raise my final grades thanks to it.

Now I’m over 20, and my depressive and manic symptoms haven’t improved at all — obviously because I haven’t received proper treatment 😅. Things have actually gotten worse over time, though I’ve never noticed my ADHD medication making my mood symptoms better or worse. During manic episodes, I often don’t take it at all, and during severe depressive episodes I usually can’t — I either sleep constantly or just stare at the wall or my phone. But during milder depressive phases, I take my medication (vyvanse 50 mg), and that’s when I feel the closest to what I remember “normal” feeling like.

Now, after many setbacks and disappointments, my treatment process is finally about to begin. I’ve been consistent with my appointments at the substance abuse clinic and have shown that I’m committed to recovery. What I’m wondering is: once they start me on proper medication for bipolar disorder, is it possible they’ll stop my ADHD medication?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can share their experiences or shed some light on this!

P.S. I have dyslexia, so this might be a bit messy and full of typos — sorry! Hopefully it still makes sense 😛🥰

2025-11-03 22:47:21;Newly diagnosed;I’ve been seeing psychiatrists for 20 years now. I’ve been diagnosed with various things by different docs- PMDD, ADHD, dysthymia, MDD and now Bipolar2. It’s confusing because years ago several docs ruled out B2 for me because I guess they didn’t think the manic periods counted as actual hypomania. But my current doc thinks that my Ups do count as hypomania periods, even though they’re not that dramatic from the outside. I guess I’m now learning to view it not from the POV of an average person’s Ups and Downs, but the swing that I experience. So for me, my depressions range from dysthymia to painful darkness, and my hypomania looks like bursts of energy, creativity, exuberance, and then irritability before it changes to depression. I always thought my Up periods represented me doing well- meaning my treatment plan for depressions was working and so I was feeling good like my true self. And my partner has definitely adopted the mindset that that is the real me, because I’m not destructive during those times, so why would anyone view it as anything other than just being Awesome, the vivacious creative confident person everyone wants to be. But now that this new doc is dating B2, I’m thinking of it differently, and thinking that the Ups do not represent me doing well, it’s just all part of the whole cycle. A perfect example (and what led to her thinking I am BP2) is that I tried ketamine treatment for depression, and I thought it was a “game changer” for my depression because I felt so amazing for 2 weeks but she thinks that was just hypomania. Im feeling very confused and hopeless. I’m already on 2 antidepressants and 1 ADHD med. i also have insomnia and take various sleep meds each night. I’m groggy/hungover every morning till afternoon. I just feel like there’s no med for me that’s gonna work. And anyways what does “better” look like for me anyways? Is it having more happy days? Or just less up-and-down. I don’t even know anymore.

2025-11-03 19:06:25;I need some perspective on my situation with my bipolar ex;"
So, here’s the story. My ex has bipolar disorder and was diagnosed almost two years ago. We had been together for nearly 3 years when he had his first manic episode. He was doing Erasmus abroad and suddenly changed overnight ,his behavior, the way he talked, everything. I didn’t understand what was happening. He started saying contradictory things and we eventually broke up because he couldn’t include me in his life plans anymore.

After that, he became really condescending toward me. When he came back, he reached out again, and that’s when I realized something was seriously wrong and he needed help. He ended up seeing a psychiatrist, and honestly, the whole process was hard for him and also for me. His family was in denial about his diagnosis, so I was pretty much the only one trying to support him.

Eventually, we slowly got back together. But he never really talked to me about what he was going through. Maybe he didn’t think I would understand? The communication between us always felt fragile, and even though I tried my best to support him, I constantly felt anxious and unsure about our relationship.

After about a year, he broke up with me again. It wasn’t dramatic, and we stayed on good terms. A few months later we started seeing each other again casually (not as a couple) and then one day he suddenly told me he was with someone else, without any explanation.

A month later, he brought this new girl to a party with our mutual friend group despite the fact that the only thing I asked for was that if either of us started seeing someone new, we should wait until it’s serious before bringing them into the group. The night turned into a disaster, I ended up talking to the new girl and apparently he already lied to her about what our relationship was. When our friends confronted him about how weird this all was, he shrugged it off and said it’s his life and he doesn’t owe me anything.

Only two people in the group know he’s bipolar, so everyone else is just confused by his behavior. Meanwhile, I’m hurt and honestly really lost. I don’t know how much of this is the illness and how much is just him choosing to act like a jerk. I don’t want to excuse bad behavior, but I also know bipolar disorder affects relationships and judgment.

I’d like to hear other people’s thoughts or experiences. I feel stuck between compassion and the feeling that I was disrespected and used. ";r/BipolarSOs;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1on8vwe/i_need_some_perspective_on_my_situation_with_my/

He was kinda fascinated. Saying things like ""oh, I have that too, this too, maybe I have bipolar, or this etc.."" with exaltation. He also mentioned a friend of his age who self-diagnosed herself with bipolar. I didn't know what to do so I talked to him about my darkest time, the irreversible mistakes I made, the horrible intrusive thoughts, the literal pain. But although he agreed it was bad, and I wish he'll never deal with what I dealt within the past. He was still really enjoyed talking about schizophrenia, bipolar, depression and how he could have these disorder. I tried to be the most convincing, he also diagnosed my mom with bipolar (she doesn't have it), which kinda proves to me he can't understand, and don't know the symptoms at all.

He saw me. He saw the cops taking me from my home multiple times, for years my family was broken and idk. Why would he thinks it's ""cool"" ? Maybe it's because he's a teenager ? Social media ? Why would he want to be mentally ill ?

2025-11-03 15:49:11;medication issues for bipolar + other mental illnesses;"tw: mentions of anorexia bulemia and body dysmorphia

felt like i’ve hit a wall with all the different medications i’ve tried for my mental illnesses. had to post this in this subreddit as others guidelines and rules interfered with trying to explain medication. for context i’m diagnosed with bipolar type 2, bpd, mdd, anxiety, insomnia and anorexia bulemia. i’ve struggled with medication that’s actually had a positive effect on my mood for years that doesn’t have life-disruptive side effects, and i was first initially diagnosed with depression and anxiety way back in 2019, then the other illnesses just kept piling on through the years. some that i’ve tried are escitalopram, effexor, seroquel, mirtazapine, fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline among others. most of the side effects that ive gotten from the medication have been so disruptive in my everyday life and it’s at a point where i’m just so tired of looking. one of main side effects have that i noticed i have with ANY medication is tremors, to the point where i need support just to walk down stairs. i’m currently taking mirtazapine (2 months taking now) and seroquel (10 months) both at night. the mirtazapines made me gain so much weight (10kg in just a month) that it’s starting to deteriorate my self image and feeding into my body dysmorphia which was actually starting to improve prior to taking the mirtazapine. i wake up 2-3 times a night because of the hunger. i wake up so hungry where i need to eat something in order to fall back asleep, and that in itself is affecting my bulemia and is causing me to be sick more. vivid nightmares, constipation and diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, constant brain fog mental blanks, the list goes on. the only positive affect from anything is the medication puts me to sleep, but doesn’t keep me asleep. id love to hear any experiences anyone else’s had with troubles with medication and what they’ve found has personally helped them, thank you to anyone who’s read this far i appreciate it!";r/bipolar2;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1on5u39/medication_issues_for_bipolar_other_mental/

2025-11-03 10:40:09;it’s kinda sad when you finally see the hypomania from the past.;"I have a hard time noticing or acknowledging a hypomanic episode and even doubt my diagnosis often. The only time I was so sure of it was when I was on Wellbutrin having terrible mixed hypomania. 

In July I used a pay in 4 plan for $455 Egyptian blue lotus. I wanted it for my herbal tea/smoke blends business. (Looking back that is insane for one herb but I just HAD to have it, the real thing). I also used pay in 4 for other herbs around $225. Even bought jars, materials etc. now I don’t care about the business idea and everything is sitting. I don’t want to do it anymore. I tend to have this pattern a lot. Right before it I spent hundreds of dollars on beads for a jewelry store. Then wanted nothing to do with it. And decided I wanted to switch to the herbs. Actually the herbs was an idea from around 2023… I also bought a ton of herbs around that time, made logos, a site etc. then dropped it. This July I picked it back up, I rebought everything new plus more things… 

I feel a bit embarrassed because I posted and shared my progress and ideas on social media. Only my close friend list on instagram which is a small amount of people but still embarrassing. I was posting every bracelet I made giving them names, showing the site. Then just said I wanna go back to my organic herbal blends business. Posted pics of the herbs and all the jars. I have a fuck ton of shit. And then radio silence on everything… and now I have all this shit just sitting and unpaid balances :/

Is this really because of bipolar? I don’t know. I always feel this sense of urgency with these things and buy as much as I can all at once. In the moment I feel like it’ll be life changing. I’m really fucked.. how will I ever achieve anything like this? How can I be so sure of myself? I feel like it all just kinda hit me that maybe this diagnosis is right..

2025-11-03 09:49:05;Could it be bipolar mania?;"Hi I’m new here (28F), my SO (35M is diagnosed Autistic (previously labeled Aspergers). This past year has been very difficult and he has frequently had what we have been calling autistic meltdown crises. They have always occurred after an argument, and especially when I insisted I needed a break from arguing to calm down. 
His behaviour when he is angry and frustrated is not consistent with his values when he is calm. He becomes so incredibly defensive and threatened and any behaviour that comes out of that defensiveness he will justify without any logic. 
Just recently I started considering that he might possibly be entering psychotic episodes, because what he says when angry really is feeling more like delusions.  With his  recent rapid shifts  in and out of his angry state I was asking him more questions about his general beliefs and I found out that: What he believes when he is angry- he does not believe when he is calm. And even if he has recognised in a calm state that a previous angry belief was illogical and out of touch/wrong, if he gets angry again(for something unrelated) he will forget that he saw the logic/forget that he changed his mind/ forget that he stopped believing the illogical angry argument . When I point out he has already changed his mind on his original belief, he dismisses it and fully believes he always thought the same way, only then for him to get calm again and acknowledge how absurd that was. 

Is this what bipolar mania can be like? With delusions that are only present in a manic state? 

Edit: forgot to mention SO is currently in process of reviewing diagnoses. So far just to consider ADHD and complications from Autism so we want to mention to the professionals if we feel there is something more- we had both never considered bipolar before.

2025-11-03 08:21:20;Fatigued;"I feel a suffocating loneliness. I do not know when it will end. I think if I was able to find someone who understood me, the emptiness would subside.

  
I am deathly frightened that this companionship will never come. I have been loved by several men in my life and none of those times did the emptiness leave. Sometimes I question if I am capable of love or just haven't met the right person.

  
I try with my platonic friendships. I love my family and my friends. But I don't want to be a burden on anybody. I don't know how to share the full depth of myself without destroying someone. 

  
I'm learning that this is life. This is all there is. Maybe the emptiness is life. I can't help but want it to end. I've tried medication, therapy, meditation, maximising my health in every other subset of life but it doesn't leave. I am constantly regulating. 

  
I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and BP since I was a teenager. Two years ago I saw multiple psychiatrists and was told by different psychs that I have autism and BPD.

2025-11-03 07:42:45;Bipolar life after 1.5 years of diagnosis;"So it happened, no one told me it could take almost 2 years to reach rock bottom.
I imaged it would be different, I would be at jail, not alive, in the psych ward. But I’m not, I’m in my couch, not even sobbing too harsh, just a few tears and a sigh. 

I lost all my money, been paying a huge a debt, now I walk everyone as I no longer have cash nor available credit to even ask for an uber, i rather spend it on food obviously.

My now ex boyfriend finally left me, and it’s already dating other girls, which is fine, he’s in his right and I fucked him through the course of 2 years where this all began.

I haven’t learned much on my current job, had a poor performance that I’m surprised I haven’t been fired yet. 

Things are realistically better than one year ago, I no longer do hard drugs, I hit the gym 5 times a week, I eat better, sleep better, look better, laugh more, cry less.

But you can’t just fix things right away. I’m not even depressed at this point, it just feels weird, idk if this illness has something to do with all I did, the things I lost that won’t ever come back, it probably does, but I don’t want to use it as an excuse.

Though I was accountable, guess I really wasn’t. I know things can get better, and will probably get better, it just aches me to think that I would have probably prevented this. I could have probably saved money, have a car, think of buying an apartment at this point, I would be leaner, and on a stable relationship with someone who just wanted me for who I was and wanted to see me get better, I could have been loved and cherished and been settled at this point.

Rather I’m alone, (I know I’m not 100% alone, but you know what I mean). Not that I can’t carry this, I have to go through. One day at a time, I just kind of wish it was different, and I don’t want to wish that, I want to accept, and It frightens me to think that I will always regret what I did the last 2 years of my life. That’s it.

2025-11-03 06:19:53;SO having delusions of me cheating/hiding something from him;"This is going to be a bit long and potentially formatted weird because mobile but here goes. My husband and I have been together for 12 years in two weeks, he was diagnosed as bipolar before we met, and I joined this sub as soon as I found it because it was just so relatable and I felt so much less alone. However about 5 years ago his diagnosis was changed to schizhoaffective disorder and that seems to line up much better with his symptoms, however there's no schizhoaffective or even just schizophrenia SO support groups here so I'll just make a post here, as many of y'all's struggles I find 100% relatable and I'm certain some of you can relate to this as well.

An incredibly common delusion my husband has is that I'm cheating on him, and pretty much every episode he's had since we've been together has started out with false accusations of cheating, or even just plain hiding something from him and he just can't figure out what. A few months ago he had an episode, and we worked through it like we always do and things were really good. He's always been pretty med compliant, only stopping or changing something a few times and this last episode a few months ago he had lowered his dose of clozapine by himself without telling me, his doctor, or anyone else who may like to know that, but we got him stable again and got through it. He asked for couples counseling and I said yes, because you wouldn't drive a car for 12 years without a tune up, so maybe our relationship could use one. Like many of you guys have said as well, our relationship is damn near picture perfect when he's not going through an episode and I genuinely cannot fathom trying to navigate the rest of my life without him, and we really only seem to have these problems during episodes. Our counseling was going great, and after just a month she was even suggesting we go from once a week to biweekly. But nothing gold can stay, and this week has unfortunately led to yet another episode. The first sign I should've known this was coming was when he got paranoid about me being at the store for longer than I should've been. Which yes, I was, but not because I was out painting the town red, but because I have ADHD and can easily wander around a store for an eternity if I'm not with someone who can tell me we need to leave. He called to ask where I was, I explained I just lost track of time and was looking through all the Halloween stuff and that I'd come right home, did just that and we had a good night for the rest of the night and carved some pumpkins. But then we stayed out a bit too late on Halloween, he took his meds very late and didn't sleep hardly at all, and after that all of our progress seems to have gone straight down the toilet. We work together as well, and had to work the day after, and I know that stressor didn't help either, and after a bit of a weird incident at work (someone was looking in my car, there's more to it that I can't get into but this is what started it) he starts going on again about how I'm hiding something, and he kept saying ""something isn't right,"" or ""I'm tired of being fucked with.""

We live and work together. There are very, very few times we're apart, and when we are he has my phone location and can see exactly where I am. Yet, as I'm sure some of you have already guessed, this isn't enough. I could have a surveillance camera pointed at me 24/7 recording my every move, but when he's like this nothing could ever convince him I'm not cheating, he'd probably say the footage was doctored.

He calmed down after work and we were having a pretty great night. I made us an awesome dinner, I set up my ofrenda for dia los muertos, he tidied up the living room and everything finally felt normal and as it should.

Then I made the mistake of not being able to predict the future, and I mentioned us potentially going to see a comedian I like in April. He couldn't remember this comedian, so I pulled up his YouTube channel and played a short to jog his memory. Then I noticed a new short, haven't seen this one yet, let's give it a watch. And surprise surprise, the fucking thing ended on a joke about the guy being cheated on and the switch flipped and his mood immediately shifted. Right back to looking at me like I'm the most disgusting person he's ever seen, like I showed him that to try to intentionally mess with him. I tried to spend the rest of the night like we normally would, but it was too late, I could tell the damage had been done and suggested we just go to bed. Said goodnight, I love you to him only to get just a goodnight back.

I really hoped after a good night's sleep he'd be feeling better, but again this morning I could tell he wasn't. Made some coffee for him like I always do, and got dressed because we were meant to go to a dia de los muertos festival with my mom and sister today. However my mom was taking forever to get ready and we both fell back asleep on the couch from being so dang tired. He woke me up by getting up to go sleep in the bed, and I asked him if he still wanted to go to the festival. He said no, he wanted to sleep. I said ok and figured I could probably just try to put this behind me and enjoy the day myself and see if he felt better after sleeping for the whole day (which he has done before). I had planned on going in and was already wearing a very nice dress (think long semi-formal gown), but I was sad and frustrated that he wasn't coming with and didn't want to keep wearing it, so I changed into something else, another dress but more casual and comfortable. He saw me do this and snarkily asked if I ""had a hot date."" Said no, I just wanted to put on something more casual since you're not coming with us. He knows I like to dress up for him. I still planned on going, but when I kissed his cheek and said ""bye, I love you"" I was again met with a disdained ""ok.""

And I kinda lost it. Started crying, called my mom and told her we wouldn't be coming and why, took my dress off and put some pajamas on and just bawled my eyes out. I was trying to do it quietly but apparently I was being loud enough to disturb him, because he got up and just walked right out the door without so much as a glance my way. Turned off his location which he loves to do when he does this, and just fucked off for an hour. I cried that whole time, and finally stopped right before he came back to use the bathroom, get a drink and leave again, once more without even looking at me. If I'd killed myself while he was gone I have no doubt he would've just walked right by my corpse. This of course made me cry yet again, and now here we are. He's back, on his laptop ignoring me, but he at least waved to me when I said hi to him so.... that's something I guess.

I don't know.... I'm just so tired. I hate seeing the man I love be consumed by this stupid disorder. I hate being accused of shit I wouldn't ever dare do. I hate it all.

If you made it this far, my god you have the patience of a saint, but thank you for reading all my sad ramblings that I've had to re-write and proofread several times due to the crying. Again, I'm sure at least someone here can relate... :(";r/BipolarSOs;6;8;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1omupfl/so_having_delusions_of_me_cheatinghiding/
2025-11-03 05:29:41;Seeking for advices for BPD, BD-2, GAD, C-PTSD and ADHD all together;"Hey reddit,

I've created a new account to stay anonymously. 

I'm 25 years old and been diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), ADHD, GAD, MDD, but recently there was signs of Bipolar especially of episodes of hypomania after starting or increasing dosage of antidepressants and pretty much unstable mood with my mood being as roller coaster. After that I've tried to remember all episodes of my life from childhood and I realized that all my life pretty much been with huge signs of bipolarity, but episodes were long enough - couple of months/weeks of hypomania/mania (with me having 2-5 hours of sleep everyday and having a lot of energy and motivation for crazy projects etc) and then couple of months/weeks of huge depression.

Now my doctor asked me complete different forms to see if they are indeed suitable for BP and not just BPD - and yes, all of them were true for me, which confirms BP. All my life I lived and did not understand what's going on - there was time when I though that I'll be able to achieve anything I want with my unordinary thinking to resolve different problems, and there was also time with huge depression and s... thoughts (mostly passive s... tho). I never had stable relationships, and the same time I tried to be close and then opposite. I was so optimistic when my doctor recommended to try Spravato therapy and when I read about really good fast results I was so happy that finally I'll be able to get rid off depression - but no, after 2 months no results, as well as from high dosage of antidepressants. I'm on DBT therapy for more than a year and I feel like it helps, but not much as I can't open myself. The same time I have crazy anxiety out of nowhere and fully emptiness.

Finally more or less I know my diagnoses which is BPD, BD-2 (with depression being part of it, not MDD probably), GAD, ADHD, C-PTSD (confirmed with psychotherapist and results of Spravato, when flashbacks almost disappeared), Social Anxiety and most likely (not confirmed yet) OCD and Eating Behavior disorder. My mom few months ago without knowing dr detected bipolar signs that time mentioned me that she has huge bipolar signs and my DNA test also mentioned much increased risk of BD. I also have fearful-avoidant attachement style. 

Now more or less I know what's going on terms of diagnoses, but still have no idea how to ease all of this and be able to live normal life as others. I also feel like all those years were wasted due to this and without me reaching out to psychiatrist quite late (a year ago; when everything went crazy). Completely have no idea how I will survive in this hell especially when all symptoms are increasing and now I never leave apartments without my meds.

I'm sure a lot of you guys also struggling with similar problems and would love to hear how do you deal with all of this and would appreciate any advices as well. 

Thanks and good luck to all of us. ";r/bipolar;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1omthlm/seeking_for_advices_for_bpd_bd2_gad_cptsd_and/
2025-11-03 05:22:36;People have told me my “cycles” sound like bipolar- I’m not sure, so I want to ask people who actually have it.;"I’m not looking for a diagnosis or medical advice, I just want to understand whether my experiences sound similar to what people with BD go through.


I’m autistic, and I know hyperfixation is common with that, but these cycles feel different- more intense and mood-related than just getting deeply interested in something.


So I go through a two week period or “cycle” of being intensely hyperfixated over something; a topic, an interest, a vibe or certain aesthetic. where I would focus on that thing solely and fully commit to it, and genuinely give it my all. That also comes with changes of sleep, I would feel tired but I do not and can’t put my phone down and go to sleep. It could and have changed my entire worldview overnight, and it takes over my mind, my thoughts would be racing, and since I don’t have an outlet or someone to talk to about it I just write about that topic. I don’t experience that period BECAUSE I love the topic, I just experience it because I need to hyperfixate on something. I would latch onto a topic that I find interesting enough and have some basic understanding of it, and then dive deep into researching it, writing about it, centering my whole worldview around it. And it usually ends when week 2 hits, and then after that I usually feel low until I find something new to hyperfixate on, and if I don’t find that quick enough my mood gets much worse. It’s endless, I’ve been experiencing it for years but I’ve only started noticing it about a few months ago, and now I can just predict what’s going to happen after each cycle that it doesn’t surprise me anymore.


For people who have bipolar disorder- does this sound at all like what you experience, or is it more of an ADHD/hyperfixation kind of thing? I’m just really curious how this compares to your own experiences.";r/BipolarReddit;4;53;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1omtbaj/people_have_told_me_my_cycles_sound_like_bipolar/
2025-11-03 05:19:02;Hypomania surge from mood stabilizer?;"Hi friends.

I was diagnosed last spring, and immediately started working my way up from 25mg to 100mg of lamotrigine—which is what I’m currently at. 

Before I started taking medication, I had a tendency to fall more into depression than hypomania. Sure, I had impulsivity and increased energy bursts, but the depression was always the most prominent and longlasting. It also made me more antisocial. Now I’d say that I went from being introverted and embarrassed to show my face, to extroverted and agitated. 

Now, I think I’ve been hypomanic like almost all summer and fall? When I get sad, it’s less of a depression and more of an agitation. I don’t cry a whole lot anymore, I get panic attacks and then I do some crazy impulsive shit to get over it. Like staying out at the bar until 3am, shoplifting or spending beyond my means, I relapsed on drugs several times, I started sh during my panic attacks—(which is something I never tried before or thought would “work” for me). Also when it’s come to dating—I’ve taken multiple girls out on dates over the past few months, made out with s multiple strangers in the same night. I’m in my last semester of college right now and I cannot for the life of me lock in and get my work done. I’m so behind, and if I don’t graduate this semester I’m really setting myself up for failure, because my lease ends and my seasonal work position is expiring and all my friends are leaving. I don’t have family here. I have to go somewhere new, and I’m anxious to start paying off my student loans so I need a big girl job. 

I self-harmed really badly a couple of days ago. I tried to get into the campus doctors office because my wounds were super bad, but they were booked so I ended up sobbing while I was trying to ask for bandaids and stuff to put on it. The girl saw my wrist and looked at me like so shocked and it just felt surreal and humiliating 

Then when I woke up the next day I had crazy suicidal ideation. I called the suicide hotline but it didn’t help. I wanted to talk to someone in person. I want in person therapy but I keep getting turned away because I’m told I need to see someone who specializes in treating bipolar and cptsd involving rape. 

Anyway, I had my supplies and I wrote a note. The suicidality stems from intense shame and fear that I can’t maintain long-lasting relationships. I don’t think I’m impossible to love, I think I’m exhausting to love. My life has changed so rapidly in such a short amount of time due to trauma and the fact that I haven’t been able to fully slow down and process it because I’m putting myself through college and live alone, so I don’t have a strong sense of self. 

I was pretty certain that I was gonna do it but then I drank a bottle of wine and took a long shower.

If I were to say I have a hobby, it would have been driving. I fucking loved it. I’m not even big into cars, it was just nice exploring while comfortably listening to music or talking to my significant other. I miss it more than a homeless man could miss bacon.

I loved that job, I transferred into a different department and people see me in my current position and obviously they just feel bad or awkward, so they try to say something nice or make conversation, it’s the thought that counts, but it makes me feel like I’m being treated the same you would treat a lost puppy yknow. 

I’ve had multiple medical emergencies at work and now even panic attacks, my stressors all have been piling up and I’m stuck at a standstill. 

The current game plan is a medical test to see what route can be taken to prevent further complications or see if there could be a chance at basically fixing me up. But that isn’t for some time, and when they send possible rescheduling, it’s 3 hours away we can’t up and go that day because someone cancelled. 

But to sum up what I’ve been going through is this, I haven’t really felt this low ever, I have been faking smiles for years now but recently I have noticed myself putting a serious effort into appearing as though I’m having a good time if someone’s looking my way to avoid confrontation. I live with my significant other with her parents, we graduated high school in 2021 and she’s been working towards nursing and working as a patient care tech, while I was in Security at our towns hospital. I never really knew what I wanted to do. In my time in security I had been leaning towards EMT or Firefighter but still didn’t know what I wanted to do. The first time I was hospitalized I just remembered feeling confused when I got out, like I didn’t believe it was true, then after the following times it became less and less doubtful. I still have the picture of my father beside my hospital bed when I was first hospitalized. I was Intubated in the ICU for 5 days. My girlfriend working in healthcare would take care of me when she was free from work. 

When I had been discharged and she told me she’d taken care of cleaning me during my stay, it brings me to tears every time I think of it and I know I’d do anything for that woman, shit on a plate and I’d eat it with a baby’s spoon for you to watch, you name it. 

But relationship goals aside I genuinely have been kinda scared, I’ve been hostile, my outlook at times has been “ there’s no point”, my mental space has become similar to when I was in 8th grade, except 8th grade coping mechanisms and 22 year old disabled man problems don’t mix well. I started stashing knives. I fell into old bad eating habits. My want to follow properly getting my daily meals is diminished by the lack of confidence and just not caring about my physical health. I found myself planning out my finances and seeing if I could use retirement savings to pay off my car to give it to my baby sister so she has a new(ish) car for when she could drive. I’ve been a nympho since middle school and started smoking in high school, all of which one could probably call to an “abusive” extent. But lately I go through thc cartridges like disposable vapes and I smoke nicotine constantly, my vape is in my hand and I am smoking 24/7, the masturbation is just downright outta hand, everyday at least more than once, for some that’s maybe nothing, but I’ve done it in public bathrooms just to get it out. 

Nowadays I always carry an emergency dose and if I forget it the people I’m with are anxious which of course, my stressors being sleep hygiene and stress, doesn’t help. My most common side effect is partial seizures, specifically my mouth, chewing on a particular piece of my lip or cheek, sometimes just swallowing repeatedly 

I keep thinking of “last conversations” I’d have with those I know, thinking of who I appreciate and how I would tell them for the last time. I keep thinking one thing over and over, she deserves better. Someone who can better provide, but someone who hasn’t scarred her so deeply already. Part of me wanted her to just tell me to leave. I’m stuck knowing I’ve hurt the one person I’d ever come to love this deeply, I’d known a romantic love before but with her I feel fulfilled, and how could you be fulfilled if your partner scares you by eating a sucker.

2025-11-03 04:42:39;Bipolar (Mania);I’m interested to know how y’all got diagnosed? And how does it feel to be in a mania/ manic episode? ;r/BipolarReddit;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1omsauv/bipolar_mania/
2025-11-03 04:40:12;Got diagnosed with bipolar II;"20M, recently I've been having extreme lows with constant anxiety, i thought it would be some form of mood disorder alongside depression, I was on antideps on and off for a while (1.5 months) cause my last psychiatrist prescribed me those with some insomnia tabs.. 

here's how the meds provided by last psych worked:
1)i felt my mood crash reduced and got stabilised, generally i used to get suicidal on my lows..
2)i messed up and missed updating the dosage from 1->1.5 tab after a certain interval.. which was actually on my prescription, I updated it later so I wonder maybe that's reduced the effectiveness and i got mood crashes?
my new psych tho after hearing it all suggested it's bipolar, I was confused cause I didn't specify anything about mania and honestly recently it's mostly either depressive lows complimented with constant anxiety/panic idk some heavy feeling in the chest OR me being normal..i don't notice the mania stuff much but i did have short bursts of energy as a teenager but if anything the most ""mania"" i feel recently is just humble happiness maybe and lightweightness(generally after i take anxiety pills and antideps)

now I'm confused was it my lack of communication for which I got wrongly diagnosed or do i actually have it, wishing for the former actually, I'll text the psych and get updates. 

what do y'all think?

2025-11-03 03:22:55;Can bipolar 2 get worse or even turn into bipolar 1?;"Hey, I’m 23F, and I was diagnosed with bipolar II about 7 years ago. I never started any meds, so I’ve basically been raw-dogging life ever since, but lately, it feels like my hypomanic episodes have gotten more intense.

It’s hard to describe, but I’ve also noticed that my mood swings have become shorter and more extreme. When I was younger, I’d be depressed for weeks, then feel good and “normal” for maybe two days before the depression came back. Now it feels like my mood shifts several times a week. It’s been really disruptive, I‘ve been all over the place. I kinda ruined my life, sabotaged my career & relationship and even lost a lot of friendships because of it. 

So my question is, is it possible for BP2 or the hypomania to get worse over time or even develop into BP1? 

I can’t ask my therapist about it because I went no-contact with her 3 years ago.

2025-11-03 03:08:53;need validation;hello all. i am a 29 year old male diagnosed with bipolar type 1 disorder. i was diagnosed when i was 18 in navy bootcamp, where i had my first manic episode. since then, i have had a total of 11 episodes in 11 years. I am currently leaving my job as a paid firefighter because of the stress i was dealing with while working. I also had a manic episode on a fire ground that lead to a hospitalization. It sucks because I always wanted a career that had something to do with service. However, I just felt like I couldn’t handle the job. There is a part of my mind that keeps telling me I could do this if only I worked harder and was more mentally tough. I guess im looking for validation that I’m doing the right thing by leaving instead of trying to stick it out. It’s important to note that I was offered an office job to stay with the city and work in a different department that would definitely be a lot less stressful but just wouldn’t come with the perks of being a firefighter. thoughts?;r/BipolarReddit;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ompw9y/need_validation/
2025-11-03 02:39:50;Angry and mean when drunk - verbally hurting partners;"Hi,

I (19F) got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 two months ago. I’ve had the symptoms and episodes for over two years now though. Both of my serious relationships in the last years have commented on how mean I am especially when drinking.

I will tell them I don’t want to see them anymore, that I hate them, I will make personal attacks at them and their character. A few nights ago I had a blackout and sent paragraphs of mean messages to the partner I have been seeing on and off for over a year. Messages saying he was a horrible person, didn’t deserve love, and more along that line. I don’t know why I did it and I was not agitated into it either :(. 

I deleted them from my phone because I am too embarrassed to read them but I know he still has it on his phone. I apologized the next morning and he brushed it off (likely because he is used to this happening every now and then) but I feel so ashamed. How do I stop this behavior. I started meds a week ago. 

Has anybody else dealt with this? I don’t want to cut out alcohol entirely but even after 3 drinks I can start getting mean. I am nice to my friends. But both my recent boyfriends pointed out this behavior and how hurtful it is to them. Any advice would be so appreciated.

2025-11-03 01:07:26;Hypomania despite being medicated;"Hi guys
23F diagnosed with bipolar 2 (and adhd) when i was 19 and medicated ever since. I take 300mg lamictal and 25mg sertraline and its changed my life and i feel so much more stable. No more major depressive episodes. BUT i do experience occasional very short periods of what still feels like hypomania. It doesnt last weeks and months like it used to, only a day or a few days at most. Afterwards, i completely crash out of exhaustion.
Does anyone else experience this ? Ive been on the same dose for 3 years and dont rly talk to my psychiatrist lol (even tho ik i should).
Its not that big of a deal except that it impacts my relationship with my bf when it happens because he gets very overstimulated by it. In turn that makes me feel guilty about myself and when i reflect on how im like i get so embarassed but i dont even realise when its happening
I also semi-suspect i have fibromyalgia or some other chronic pain condition. So as soon as i get home i feel like a truck thats crashed into a brick wall and become too tired to do anything at all, even getting off the couch seems like such a big labour.

2025-11-03 00:49:04;Second time the charm...?;"I had a major crash out yesterday. It's been worse, hospitalization worse after an attempt; So this wasn't comparatively as bad, after being sober for years, everything was going amazingly! Money up, and I even did an incredible cosplay for Halloween. Probably shouldn't have drank but I'd been good for years, right?

The crash was bad, I won't go into detail but thank God I have people who care for me around, otherwise I'd still be locked in that tail spin. and this time I knew I needed the doc so off I went. Funny thing is, I stopped seeing this doctor because I felt he was wrong and no ways I'm BP1, I could accept the ADHD diagnosis though. Looking at the drawn out manic episode (which felt amazing, why should I not want to feel that good?) Then the crashes,  well, I'm back on the meds now. 

Trying still not to feel like hell, I spend so much money, I lied to people I love, I literally risked my life, repeatedly. It's shame and guilt and hopeless nothingness, and when I really think about it, it doesn't even feel like I was having fun, I think someone was but it doesn't feel like me. I don't know, I'll keep at this regime and maybe I'm ready to accept the diagnosis, I just don't know right now, I hope to know.

2025-11-03 00:37:50;Neither my family nor psychiatrist will hear me out on my 'autism' being a misdiagnosis;"I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I've heard it's a common experience with bipolar.

I now got diagnosed with bipolar, symptoms of which started at 13 with my first depressive episode. I got diagnosed with autism right after quarantine, as a depressed and anxious 13 yo. 

I haven't had a meltdown/shutdown since I was like 15. I'm extroverted. I have no texture/stimulation issues. I don't have any trouble reading body language or social cues. 

Along with the autism there was also giftedness, which causes a few issues such as me being way ahead in the conversation then other people and not being good at teamwork because i get irritated at people bringing me down.(Perfectionism)

 I just grew out of any 'symptoms' i had as I got more confidence and comfortable with my body...

And yet every time I bring it up to my family they start bringing up minor things that they classify as autism symptoms. If you're looking you can find high functioning autism in ao many people, the symptoms are sometimes human behaviour upped. 

A major one always brought up is how I like to swing with music on so I can daydream about stories I write. I admit it's not the most normal thing, personally I'd classify that as maladaptive daydreaming...

It's just so frustrating. Has anyone here been through something simmilar, how did you get rid of it?";r/bipolar2;8;10;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1omm043/neither_my_family_nor_psychiatrist_will_hear_me/

2025-11-02 21:24:52;Newly diagnosed and struggling;"I was diagnosed bipolar 2 a few days ago and it still hasn’t fully registered. I’ve known something was very wrong since about 13 or 14 and just have been white-knuckling life since then (now f24). I’ve always fallen into deep depression and truly my only reason for getting through would be feeling amazing on the other side (albeit a little wreckless, but fun). My mom was diagnosed bipolar 1 and I always thought there’s no way I can be bipolar because I’d look at her and I’d look at me and comparatively I really had my shit together haha (no jail time, not in debt etc). 

So when my psych diagnosed me I internally disagreed. But the more I’m reading of the experiences here and criteria I’m realizing that everything fits, everything fits perfectly. I feel happy to have an answer and somewhere to go. I feel sad that I lived like this for so long. I feel angry that in just one more way it feels like my mom fucked me over. I started the abilify that was prescribed and after one dose I felt so out of it. I feel like I’m standing at the bottom of a mountain and being asked to climb, the only consolation is that I’ve already been climbing for so long, maybe this time I’ll finally get to the top by getting help.

2025-11-02 20:39:46;will this ever stop?;"I don't know if anyone knows what it's like. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 in February. My therapist also recently said that I probably have borderline behavior. But my psychiatrist still has to diagnose that. Anyway, at the same time as my diagnosis in February, I had anorexia and almost died from it. Then in July, I suddenly had the idea to completely change my life. I pulled myself out of this eating disorder, changed my entire appearance, ate clean, and looked great. I exercised every day. I still do all of that, or rather, I hardly eat anymore (although I don't want to actively starve myself, as I'm still too thin), but my appetite is gone. I also exercise every day, but it no longer fulfills me. Nothing fulfills me. I have the urge to take drugs, although so far I've only been smoking weed. I was actually clean for six months because my psychiatrist said that weed isn't good for bipolar disorder. Now I've started smoking weed again. I'd also like to take hard drugs, but (thank God) I can't get hold of them because I don't have any contacts. I also smoked up the last scraps of weed so i have nothing left. There isn't a single song I like, I don't like my appearance, I don't like anything. I hardly feel anything anymore. It's like there's a wall between me and my emotions. 
The only thing I feel is fear and like an deep emptiness. 
I have the urge to destroy myself. I don't know what to do. I almost broke up with my partner of seven years because I didn't feel anything anymore. I don’t even know wtf i am doing. My therapist is on vacation so i have no one to talk to. I had to delete all my social media accounts. I'm constantly looking for people who can understand me. And when I meet someone who I think understands me, I end up disappointed (because that's never the case, of course) and my whole world collapses again. 
That's also an issue in itself. It's never in a romantic way. I love my partner more than anything (even if I don't feel anything right now, but my brain knows that), but I'm sometimes obsessed with the idea that a new person could understand me. I mean my partner does know that i’m bipolar and he’s trying his best to understand me, but he will never fully understand, because he’s not bipolar.
Most recently, I was obsessed with Yung Lean. I read that he's bipolar too. I thought he was my soulmate.
My brain is so messed up.

I really don’t know how to live with this disorder. When life gets good, I know that i have a few moments left and everything gets fucked up again. It’s so pointless.

2025-11-02 20:12:03;How do I cope with my bipolar gf not returning messages when she's manic/depressed.;There's a sweet spot between episodes that she's consistent with texts but once she starts gravitating to either pole she gets very distant. She's unmedicated and not formally diagnosed or in therapy. She was in therapy for about a year and communication was much better. Her family has a history of bipolar diagnosis ( her mother and first cousin both have been diagnosed). Her therapist suggested she get a formal diagnosis. It feels like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. When she swings to the depressed side...self harm and suicidal idealization is common for her. Her mother is a PTSD trigger for her and from my view they both trigger each other. They both spiral based on the others behavior. I've voiced my concerns. I suffer from seasonal depression and anxiety so I can put myself in her shoes to some degree. I've educated myself on bp. I know it's not my fault... it's not her fault. It's just hard watching a loved one suffer. It's like watching someone burn up in a house and you can't get to them and they can't get out...and from time to time you get blamed for starting the fire even though your getting burned trying to put the fire out..if anyone has advice..

Im the only who had gone in and it was only because I had my first manic episode. When I came down i looked at how much destruction I had caused so i went in for a diagnosis and was diagnosed Bp 1.

that said, I remember being asked about anyone else having it and I said no..but also that my family didnt really 'touch' mental health. Now my whole family is kinda distant, even when we all lived in the same house. thats why nobody else saw my episode because i holed up in my room and made it an echo chamber. 

from what i know (and i only know a little of them), my brothers havent had any manic episodes. theyve definitely been depressed, especially one brother. The one thats still at home with us will say things along the line of 'i want to die' (various variations). if I had to suspect and go along the lines of my diagnosis, id guess he has Bp2. because he can get up and suddenly become friendly, stay up etc. but he doesnt go high up as in manic. just hypo i would say.

He overall is a really nice person, even though hes always been very angry and said many means things to me. like sometimes he'll just look at me and say 'something very bad is going to happen to you one day, etc' and its very easy to set him off.

2025-11-02 18:01:41;"Question about bipolar; Mom is also bipolar.";"Hello everyone, 

So I (F26) have recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1, with psychotic features, in April of 2024. Bipolar disorder runs in my family, so I was hardly surprised when I received the diagnosis after being voluntarily admitted to a mental wellness center. 

Since then, I have been prescribed an array of meds to see what worked. I work with a psychiatrist and a therapist regularly to treat this disorder, because I understand from my family history how serious it can be. 

Here I guess is my question. My mother (55) has always been very open about her bipolar diagnosis. We have been estranged for about a decade. Its a long story, but given my diagnosis I thought it would be helpful to reach out to her and ask her more personal questions about the diagnosis, given that she's always been very open about it. I had asked her about suicide, given that between 1 and 4 and 1 and 3 peoples with bipolar disorder statically will attempt in their lifetime, and she and I are survivors ourselves. She explained to me that I can talk to as many people as I want, and I can take as many meds as I want, but ultimately I'm going to think about death everyday. Of course this was harrowing to me, but she also went on to say that really the only thing you can learn to do is just live with it. 

So, is this true? This seems like a very daunting existence.

2025-11-02 16:45:33;Do paranoid thoughts ever go away?;"Hey everyone,

I have Bipolar I and I’ve had two manic episodes in the last two years that both involved psychosis. In both, I became completely convinced that my spouse was lying to me, manipulating me, wasn’t who they said they were, doing things behind my back and was out to harm me. The fear and certainty were so intense that it felt impossible to question.

After the second episode, I ended up leaving my marriage because I couldn’t shake what I believed. At the time it all made perfect sense. I knew I was right and I saw them in a whole new light. It was devastating to realise I had been deceived. But now that some time has passed, people around me that know me well seem confused or surprised when I talk about my ex and say why I left them. They remember our relationship totally differently, and it’s left me feeling really disoriented.

Part of me still believes, and another part is starting to wonder if my mind twisted things. I know I came out of it the first time and didn’t think those things. It’s hard because it still feels true, even though logically I can see that might not mean it is true.

I’ve been reading that delusional beliefs can sometimes stick around after psychosis, especially paranoid ones, and I’m trying to understand if that’s what’s happening to me.

Has anyone else gone through this? Where the delusions didn’t disappear right away? Did they eventually fade, or do they still linger sometimes?
How did you start to tell what was real and what was illness? 

Note: I’m not currently taking medication. I’ve been struggling to accept my diagnosis which only happened recently.

Awful journey of trying to figure out why I have been so forgetful and just generally less sharp than I have ever felt in my life. I’ve been wrecked with fatigue so thick that I can barely get out of bed most days until 3-4 PM. Motivation is fried. I’m always late, I’ve lost jobs. I’ve started to just not commit to anything anymore because of these problems. It feels like my life is on pause because I can’t trust myself to follow through on things. 

Anyways - I currently take 100mgs Lamictal for what my psychiatrist thinks is bipolar. I am starting to wonder if it’s actually causing more harm than good. My psychiatrist only ever says that she thinks I am manic because I talk fairly fast and just generally a lot more than most people. I have ALWAYS been like that. It seems like that opinion is informed by what most people typically associate bipolar / mania with more than any actual evidence, especially since we speak once a month. This is also a fairly common ADHD symptom, which I am diagnosed and medicated for.  Second of all - I wouldn’t describe my mental state as having distinct peaks or valleys whatsoever. At the risk of sounding “dramatic”, I would say that I have had a pretty consistent level of heavy anxiety / depression since I was around 20 or so. I have had a few peaks in creativity, but those were actually inspired by especially shitty times where I was using drugs. 

The point is, I don’t actually really think I am bi-polar, and so I’m concerned that Lamictal is actually working against me as a result. Finding out that it inhibits glutamate (which actually improves memory for those who do well on the medication) makes me wonder if my potentially uni-polar brain’s chemistry is getting thrown out of whack by mechanism that would normally help bi-polar brains. I know it’s kind of “on brand” to think you’re not bipolar, but I just have a gut feeling im not. I’ve been very close to people who are bipolar both romantically and platonically, and while I related to aspects of their personality, I wouldn’t say we shared the same exact struggles.

2025-11-02 12:07:14;Everything makes sense!;"Everything makes sense!!!

Yesterday I saw a doctor for the first time in years because I needed my meds refilled. We talked for a long time and he basically diagnosed me with cyclothymia. I came home and looked it up and holy shit y’all….

It’s so me it HURTS. I’m literally taking an antipsychotic for depression because nothing else helps. I’ve been constantly diagnosed with major depression despite me never feeling like it fit. 

Bipolar runs extremely on my mother’s side. Almost everyone has it, including my brother and my sister also has blatant symptoms. Everything makes sense and I’m so happy. I always thought I just had weird mood swings where I was crazy and then a few hours later I felt like I couldn’t get out of the dirt. 

That’s all! I just wanted to gush about how much sense everything makes now!

2025-11-02 10:41:45;My Reputation;I’m 24 year old male and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1  almost two years ago. Went thru my first fully manic episode that lasted about 4 months. A year later my second one happened and lasted 1 month. I just can’t live with myself about saying stuff that can’t be taken back. Over bearing people s boundaries. Making people feel uncomfortable. Texting and calling all different people constantly, some I know, some I don’t. And also hitting on a ton of women. Where I know looking back I most probably made almost everyone I came in contact with feel uncomfortable. This is hard to talk to anyone about. I feel like I ruined my entire reputation and self esteem. All of us in this group realize that being full blown manic isn’t who you really are. And all your beliefs, ideals, and morals that make you who you are go completely out the window. “Who cares what people think of you”. Is the fucken hardest thing to hear. The fact that i contacted a ton of people from my high school. Was going off in my hometown. Going off where I used to live in Chicago. Which I was part of a big community there, where a lot of people know each other. When I’m manic I drink a lot and smoke a lot of weed. I feel now that I’m known as the fucken weird, creep, drunk, mental case that people are uncomfortable and scared to be around. With the manic anger lash outs, and manic HYPERNESS.

I am high functioning (I hope that isn’t an offensive term) what I mean is I have been at a very stressful job in healthcare for 21 yrs managing to work part-time (80%) with intermittent FMLA. Was diagnosed for depression most of my life. My hypomania consists of irritability, impulsiveness, mixed states. I have been in depression for an extreme length of time. I am on Spravato for 2 yrs now which has help stop my SI tremendously even though I am mostly depressed still. I just noticed this week I feel more irritable. Riled up. Picked up my guitar which I bought years ago on an impulsive purchase to start relearning to play again. Thinking of writing songs, as well as crying thinking about the past situations and feeling embarrassed. I am wondering if I am better or getting hypomanic. I feel like since my divorce 10 yrs ago something inside me shattered, and I forgot who the real me is. How are you supposed to know? I am sick of constantly analyzing my behavior. The way I act at work, around my kids, etc. I am in therapy, and see a psychiatrist who are both great, but I have no one to discuss this with. My family doesn’t want to hear about it. I’ve lost touch with friends due to my isolation. Sorry for going on and on. The bottom line is how do you know when you are on the straight line?

I used to say that whenever the low times were becoming more commonplace that “the lights are off,” and over the last month this feeling has returned in a way I haven’t felt for a while. It would be a low day or a few hours but I would get through it but over the last week or so the lights have been off. A few things are playing a part, my ex has called off reconciliation, I am in the midst of a job change so didn’t have therapy, some other internal things that I’m starting to come to terms with, probably other shit so idk.

This is not a suicide letter/desperation post i need advice on how to avoid suicide. Over the last month ive been having almost constant thoughts about offing myself, they’re not dramatic/emotional thoughts, they seem rational. It just seems like it would be easier if I was gone however I do care a lot  about the impact that it would have on my mother. I would upset her too much and she would never get over it. Recently the thoughts have got a lot, they’re constant, my behaviour in my life has changed and I find myself talking to people about what they should do if I die etc, it’s like an instinct I keep it discreet and I don’t think anyone suspects my thoughts, however I know this is a warning sign that someone is actually going to do it etc. I have a lot of the other warning sign (and out of character) behaviours such as ruining friendships reckless behaviour and I am so apathetic I really do not care about much currently. Again it’s not intentional but instinctual and I really do think im getting close to actually ‘biting the bullet’.

I just need some advice on how to avoid killing yourself. I can’t ruin my mums life and I know my mood will lift with time. this condition is a biatch. Therapy waiting lists are taking a long time and my mood stabilising medication has been taken off repeat because I stopped taking it a long while ago.

it's been better. i've been taking my medication, i've been sober, and most importantly, i finally accepted my diagnosis. well, both of them. any fellow borderlines here too? (and if yes, hey!)

accepting my diagnosis was difficult, even though it was staring me right in face. i lived undiagnosed for years and it was torture. yet being able to put a name on it was so overwhelming. i felt insane. and alone, because nobody else around me deals with this. at least, not that i know of. so for months on end i felt outcasted and upset, which resulted in heavy drinking for three months. eugh. it came to head just last month when i was suffering a really bad manic episode and ended up relapsing into self-harm on top of drinking after not doing so for nearly a month. somewhere in that mess, i realized it was time to take care of myself and get my head on straight. 

(you may have come across my prior post here, and if you did, thank you for waving to me. i needed someone to listen.)

now here i am. minding my own, doing my thing academically (we're not at peak yet, but it's okay. we'll get there) and talking to my friends again after being distant. i tend to come and go, but i really care about my loved ones. i'm thankful they try to understand me, even when i'm not comprehensible. i feel a little more comfortable in my own skin. no longer ashamed of being bipolar, or a borderline, and am building a support system with the wellness centre at my campus. the doctor there is super friendly and i like my counsellor as well. it feels good to well, feel good. to take care of myself. 

oh, and also, i've picked up writing and my beloved rhythm games again. good shit.

man. this post is really all over the place. i have so much to say. but i'll cap it off here with one more thing i wanted to say. 

i really love this subreddit.

2025-11-02 06:55:47;Lamotrigine: Is it normal to feel like emotions build up behind a wall?;"I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a bit more than a year ago. I was lucky to have a wonderful psychologist from the very beginning, and when she moved away eight months later, she made sure her colleague could take me on so I wouldn’t lose the progress I had barely started.

Finding a psychiatrist, however, was a lot harder. It took around a hundred phone calls, one very judgmental male psychiatrist who assumed I was just looking for meds, and a lot of patience until I finally met my current psychiatrist this spring. In July during my latest hypomanic phase she put me on Lamotrigine and prescribed Promethazine to help me calm down and sleep when needed.

My hypomania is fairly moderate, but my depressive episodes can get dangerously low very fast. That’s the main focus of my therapy. With therapy, I’ve accomplished a lot, and when I started Lamotrigine this summer I felt so hopeful, especially after reading so many positive experiences on Reddit. We’ve been gradually increasing the dosage and I’m currently at 150mg. I’ve already noticed some effects.

At first, I thought it was working perfectly because my energy levels stayed stable even when my mood started to dip. I felt like I could just keep going, maintain my routines, and stay productive. Routine is my anchor, so I thought this was ideal since I didn’t even have to force myself to keep it up.

After a few weeks, I realized it didn’t feel quite right. It was as if all my emotions were stored inside me and I couldn’t release them. Crying, which usually helps me process sadness, just didn’t feel possible or even logical. Then about three weeks ago, I broke down completely during therapy. We were talking about my friends, how much I love them, and how guilty I feel for what they’ve had to go through with me. I cried uncontrollably. But the moment I left the office, everything went right back to that weirdly functioning state.

A week later, I discovered black mold in my apartment. The walls have been damp for months because of a leaking gutter my landlord won’t fix. That was what finally broke me. I cried for an entire week, and I’m not exaggerating. I had to call in sick, moved back in with my parents, and my therapist even made an emergency appointment, though we had been trying to save sessions until my insurance decides whether they’ll cover long-term therapy.

Now I just keep wondering if it gets better. Has anyone had similar experiences and found ways to cope? Could this just be a phase of adjustment that stabilizes at a higher dosage? I know meds work best together with therapy, but I’m wondering if there’s something specific I can do to support the process.

Sometimes I think maybe if I had allowed myself to feel the sadness more, to rest, cry, and slow down, the breakdown wouldn’t have hit so hard. My mind was trying to tell me to pause, but the meds kept my body going, so I didn’t listen. Maybe there’s a reason we feel like doing nothing when we’re depressed. Maybe that’s the body’s way of asking for care.";r/bipolar2;8;2;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1om1lnb/lamotrigine_is_it_normal_to_feel_like_emotions/
2025-11-02 06:35:53;New to Seroquel;"I’m fresh off my first inpatient psych admission as an adult and was just finally diagnosed Bipolar 2. While having the validation of a diagnosis is great, the new medication is pretty rough so far. I’m on a lower dose of Seroquel (200 mg/day), but I have had terrible restless legs and tremors in my hands that seem to get worse as the day goes on. This has been pretty distressing since I’m an artist and can’t manage even super basic sketches and can’t keep my shading/coloring within the lines.

Is this something I should expect to just live with, or is there anything that’s worked for anyone else taking the same Rx? I don’t want to give up on this medication just yet. It’s only been a week since my first dose and it’s already helped my mood swings decrease in severity, I just wish I could stop the shaking and jolts.

Any advice is super appreciated!

2025-11-02 05:52:44;Thoughts on the Spectrum of Psychosis and Shifting from BP2 to BP1?;"
Can psychosis be mild? Is it possible to go back and forth between hypomania and full mania? 
I have a loved one with bp2 that I suspect might have mild psychosis, if that's even a thing. His episodes are definitely worsening, and I'm wondering if he's eveloping bp1. 

I'd love to hear personal experiences from people who have transitioned from Bipolar 2 to Bipolar 1, or from SOs of people who have. 
I'm also curious about what people's mania is like. Either vs. hypomania, or just in general. 
I've read a bit about both, but am wanting to hear personal stories.  
Thanks in advance! 


If you have the time to read a novel, I'm also wondering what folks think of my recently ex SOs current behaviour. 
A bit if backstory - He was diagnosed by a GP during the pandemic at 40, after a period of ups and downs that caused alarm. Prior to that there were no warning signs or history. He was prescribed lithium and told to keep certain routines. That was around 5 yrs ago. 
Until recently he mostly complied with meds, and maintained healthy routines (regular food, sleep, exercise). He was aware of and would talk about being bipolar, but was resistant to seeing a psych or adjusting/changing meds.

Right as he and I met, he moved back to his hometown, switched jobs, and left his adult and teen children in a different province (they were very close). 
We met and began dating unexpectedly, and have taken things very slow in consideration of how much all the change has affected his illness. 
He is a wonderful, warm, kind, generous, funny, loving, intelligent person. We have a beautiful compatibilty that I've never experienced before, and I would be honoured to spend my life with him. Up until this fall, no matter where his moods were at, the goal was for us to spend our lives together. He just needed to better manage his illness. 
He discarded me via text 2 months ago with zero warmth or emotion. 
I can see clearly now that he's alternated between hypomania, depression, and mixed episodes the past 2 years we've known each other.

He's in a mania now, since around August, and it's been hard to watch. He stopped his meds in the summer, had a great period of no symptoms, then shot up like a rocket. 

He sleeps about 5 hours a night now, which I suspect is a sign he's coming down, but would usually do 8-9. 
He isn't eating and has gotten skinny. He looks old. His hygeine has worsened, and he's got the classic increased energy, talkativeness, confidence of hypomania. He's irritable and thinks his family's concerns are from ""dynamics"", not him being off. He told me he doesn't have bipolar anymore - he feels great.
He's behaving very oddly at work. He suddenly ""doesn't do emails anymore"" and is oppositional with authority in a way that's a 180 from his usual personality. 
I wonder if he is hallucinating - he is seeing owls daily, and thinks they have a message for him. There are a lot of owls around (we live in a remote, wild place), but in his culture they are a bad omen, which makes me think he could be paranoid.  
He is super obsessive and goal oriented. He's completing tasks overnight that would usually take a week. 
He thought he had a political career for a bit, and is currently hyper focussed on hunting. For a few days he thought he wanted to be Premier, and last week he told me he's decided to stop aging. He thinks his family is against him because he isn't catering to their needs anymore. 
He rearranged his mother's house and thinks she's ungrateful for being annoyed (she's disabled and it is nuts that he would do that). He's tossing tons of stuff from his house because he needs to ""downsize"", then collecting random building materials from demolition sites. He isn't a builder, and has no use for those things. 

Does this sound like psychosis to anyone? I'd love to hear any thoughts or stories. 

I am essentially waiting for him to come down to tell him how he's been acting, and encourage seeking help. But, if he's got signs of psychosis I want to be aware of that.

I guess what I am asking, with this post, is what are the life experiences for you all, living with bipolar II, as opposed to the front-facing symptoms to you in your current moment? ;r/bipolar2;4;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1olrp8x/bipolar_ii_and_life_experiences/
2025-11-01 23:55:51;Help/advice;"Hi there! My partner (21M) has recently been diagnosed with bipolar following a manic episode which lasted from May-July this year. He has also had 3 depressive episodes which includes the one he is in right now. This is what I have a question about. His depression for the last 3 years has started almost exactly on October 1st. The first time it happened (October 2023) he had no history of mental health issues at all. The second time was the worst of the three and included 2 attempts on his life, and once again, started almost exactly on October 1st. This time round his depression follows his first manic episode and post mania he was fine until October 1st when he became depressed again. It comes on almost like a flick of a switch. 

Is this normal in bipolar for depressive episodes to be recurrent around a certain date/month in the year? Or could something else be going on? 

Thanks for any advice and help. ";r/bipolar2;1;7;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1olrcht/helpadvice/

She leaves the house multiple times a day, sometimes as many as 5 times, to just drive around the city. She explains she listens to music, calls family, and sort of uses it as “me time”.

I'm writing here to get a little help and answers.
My partner was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar in December after a 3rd violent manic episode and a 1-month hospitalization. Since then he has been treated correctly.
But for the past 1 week he has had disturbed sleep.
He continues his treatment but he has speeches again on the spiritual, religion, he talks a lot more than usual and lots of projects...
He is very calm, he helps me a lot at home and he is very kind to us.
He sometimes sorts around the house too.
At times I feel like it's starting again and at times I'm reassured because I find it ""normal"" and coherent.
He sleeps at night but in shifts.
I am on anti-depressants to calm my anxiety.
Please feel free to give me your experiences or advice.
I hope with all my heart that it doesn't start again because I don't know if I'll last this time";r/BipolarSOs;4;13;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oljetx/bipolar_spouse/
2025-11-01 15:30:22;Night shift;"I’ve been a CNA for six years. It’s the only job I’ve ever had. I work in Oregon, and I’m starting to realize that night shift has been destroying my mental health more than I wanted to admit.

Earlier this year I was diagnosed with Bipolar I after a really bad episode that ended with me being hospitalized. I took medical leave, started medication, and tried to come back to work thinking I could handle it. But since trying to get back on a night schedule, I haven’t been able to sleep for more than a few hours at a time.

Now I’m noticing all the warning signs again: racing thoughts, impulsive spending, cleaning for hours, starting arguments, and feeling like I’m losing control. It’s terrifying because I know where this can lead.

On top of that, since I came back, the nurses on my unit have been going out of their way to avoid me or make comments like “Are you going to explain why you’ve been gone for so long?” And honestly, I don’t owe them that. How are you supposed to tell coworkers you aren’t close with that you tried to kill yourself and got put on a 51/50 hold? There’s no easy way to say that, and I don’t think I should have to explain it.

I love patient care, but I’m so burned out. After six years of nights, short staffing, and constant emotional strain, my body and mind just can’t do it anymore. I’m planning to go back on medical leave through Paid Leave Oregon to stabilize and hopefully find a day shift position, but part of me feels completely defeated.

Has anyone else gone through something like this, where your job or schedule started to trigger your mental health to the point of relapse? Did you switch to days or leave healthcare altogether? How did you deal with the judgment or awkwardness from coworkers afterward?

Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. I’m just trying to figure out how to stay in this field without losing myself in the process.";r/bipolar;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1olht0a/night_shift/

I'm newly diagnosed (also AuDHD) and still very much learning what this means. I had a mixed episode triggered by a tricyclic antidepressant which led to my diagnosis.

I guess I just don't know what to think with this diagnosis and do the up and down moods (hypomania/mixed/depression) ever completely go away or are they just less intense?

2025-11-01 11:16:31;I'm tired;"I feel like I've done so much to support my SO. Diagnosed a couple of years ago in the middle of our relationship but has family history so I wasn't surprised. In fact, for most of our relationship, I've encouraged him to at least go to therapy because I can see how his upbringing would cause issues in anyone. Well he was diagnosed after being so awful to me when I tried to point out his hypomanic symptoms for three months and tried to get him to seek help. Only finally saw a doctor after he reached psychosis. Then went on meds, got off of them, didn't tell me, and when I noticed, he told me his psych told him he could get off. Well a couple of months later, he's having an emotional affair and still emotionally absent in our relationship. I threatened to leave and he promised to finally start addressing our relationship issues by going to couples therapy. Very high stress time. We had a bad argument once and he took off. I was so deep in my own despair that I didn't see the signs until talking with my therapist who told me he seemed to be back in hypomania/mania. He came back and we said we'd work on our relationship but again, I started pointing out the symptoms. He was much less aggressive with me but wasn't taking me seriously. Couple months of me.walking on eggshells. A couple of days ago, we're back in the hospital after he woke me up in the middle of the night asking me if someone was poisoning him or gassing him. He made me leave the hospital and told me we should part ways. A couple of hours later, he asked me to go back.

The thing I can't take - why is he so mean to me? He's mean and so arrogant. The person I met was not like this. He was shy, kind, and humble with self deprecating jokes. Today I was pointing out his meanness as a symptom and all he said was ""takes one to know one."" I asked him if he thought I also had bipolar disorder and he said he didn't know but maybe. Absolutely makes no sense. And of course I'm having terrible anxiety due to all the stress right now. And he's blaming that all on me. He doesn't see that he's the sole factor for all of my mental health problems right now. I'm giving him everything I have. I've taken off work to be with him during this time. I try to help him in anyway I can. I do all the research and put it all the effort to make sure I'm communicating with him appropriately to not anger him. I do everything to soothe him. I don't sleep because I check in on him during the night to make sure he's sleeping. I know the grounding exercises to do when he gets paranoid and anxious. I count off breathing exercises for him. I cook, I plan stress reducing activities. I'm still here after he cheated. I'm still here and willing to work on our relationship after everything. And I get treated like dirt.

He's getting medicated (started today) but I don't even know if I should stick around. I don't know if it's the disorder or if he's actually just an asshole. And who knows if he's gonna stick with it this time. He says he will but who knows. It's all chaos and it's all affecting me so badly. I go to the bathroom to cry because God forbid I stress him out more and increase his hypomania. I feel very alone. And I don't even know if can leave - I worry it'll drive him to either a worse mania or a worse depression. And the sad part, I still love him so I would hate to do that. I just really miss him.

I feel like I been in and out of depression episodes for the past 2 years but I never once felt hypomanic in between. I have times where everything in my life irritates the shit out of me and I want to die but I never felt extremely happy. I have done things out of line that were extremely impulsive and that I do very much regret, but I don’t think I ever felt mania while doing it.

I had an appointment with my counselor/proscriber and we came to the decision to up my dosage of antidepressant during the week of my period since I get so depressed during that time frame. It was the highest dose I’ve ever taken and I was not myself for that week.

I ended up having what I believed was an emotional affair on my husband with someone I met online who liked me but I only saw as a friend. During that week I became obsessed with him and let him cross boundaries and was working out like crazy to keep my mind off of him. I lost 10lbs and felt like I was addicted to him.

One night he got sexual and I don’t know what came over me, a switch flipped. I edged him until he begged me for permission to masturbate to me, it was crazy but felt incredible to have that power over him.

I went to bed next to my husband and all of the sudden the panic hit me, I wanted to vomit and I started crying. I told the guy that it was a mistake and he said he was sorry for the situation he put me in. I of course said it’s my fault because I let it happen. My counselor said that it’s not an emotional affair, it’s sickness and a fantasy because this is so far out of character for me and the medication triggered a hypomanic episode that I couldn’t control.

I tried to stop talking to him. I asked him to block me since I couldn’t stay away, he refused saying he’s in love with me and can’t let me go. It’s a whole back and forth thing. I agreed to one more normal night with him and then he promised to block me, he didn’t.

Today he said he won’t let me go because you fight for what you love and give up on things that don’t matter and that he loves me too much. I genuinely think we are both just obsessed with each other. I ended up snapping at him and told him he was ruining our goodbye and he told me I really hurt him and then he finally blocked me.

I’ve been spending this time panicking trying to let him know I didn’t mean to hurt him and I can’t control the spiral going on right now😩 I feel like a fiend and wish I could just stay friends with him. My counselor says that I need really good sleep and 7 days of a lower dose of the antidepressants and then get off of them completely.

2025-11-01 02:29:47;Potential Misdiagnosis? help me;"Bipolar Forreal? 

According to my files, I was doing well on Lexapro from late November 2022 onwards which seemed to be doing solid work with some ups and downs. This all took a turn around June 2023, when I reported to Dr. L that I was starting to feel manic. This had happened between May and June of that year. I identified a trigger in March being when Josh’s place got raided and he was presumably arrested. With a social worker on 6/16/2023, I reported: hyperactivity, depressed mood, spending a lot of money, anxious, trouble sleeping,  engaging in risky bxs (driving under the influence, had near death experience where he almost choked a couple days ago, shop lifting, engaging in unprotected sex), feeling like he is addicted to sex, raging due to anger, used shrooms a few times, using marijuana daily to manage his sxs and bxs/cope, feels disorganized, rapid speech, talkative, and has delusions of grander. 

All of these point to a manic episode. Of course, even if it wasn’t full blown bipolar, which I question now, I still needed at least a short term course of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers to regulate my mood symptoms. Of course, after this meeting, this was my last before my psychosis settled in and mania was getting out of control. I proceeded to not even answer the case manager or social worker following this meeting. It’s aggravating because they should have at least treated me for all these symptoms rather than telling me to just use my better judgement. 

My psychosis ended with me atop a parking structure in Los Angeles and jumping off of it trying to commit suicide in the start of August 2023. Now I was dealing with PTSD from the suicide attempt. I was diagnosed while in the medical hospital with Bipolar 1 sometime while I was regaining consciousness but writhing about. They did not have a clear baseline as to where I was coming from. It could have easily read as weed induced psychosis. I truly came to in a calm setting later on and that’s what I actually have memory of. Not the part where I was flailing about.

Fast forward to August of 2024, I was prescribed Zoloft by another psychiatrist Dr J who I saw once. I was on Olanzapine and Lithium at this time too so I thought that would hold me down. Then in an appointment with Dr. W, on 11/05/2024, he stated that I may actually be dealing with BPD symptoms. Of course, around this time, I realized that I already was becoming manic and was related to BPD symptoms. 

My mania and psychosis continued to progress until the end of May 2025, when I was placed in a psychiatric ward and stabilized. They seem to just give me the same medication I was on outside of the ward including lithium, olanzapine and clozapine. This seemed to work in that context, I’m not sure why. I began another depressive episode up until the present that I think is also driven by PTSD with more obvious symptoms like hypervigilance and hyperarousal.

All is to say, I am unsure about my bipolar diagnosis. Both times I was manic, it was preceded by the use of anti depressants. Even though they were stopped midway through, they could still have a rebound effect right? As well, I smoking weed throughout these times. First depression that led me to lexapro and before any bipolar diagnosis was in the fall of 2022. I don’t remember why I was depressed at the time, I just was. There was no clear cause. My subsequent depression when I left the medical hospital in September of 2023 which lasted about an entire year, I believe, was actually largely driven by PTSD.

The other day I found out that with typical mania, the lack of sleep is accompanied by the lack of feeling like you need sleep? Like, you don't feel sleepy, even though you haven't slept?

And I'm confused because whenever I become unable to sleep when I'm hypo, I still feel exhausted and loopy, I definitely feel the lack of sleep.. is that because it's hypomania instead of mania?? Or is there a chance it's not any type of mania? If I'm not actually bipolar 2 then I want to ask my psychologist to consider what else it might be, because I imagine the medication could be different if I've been misdiagnosed, but I don't see him for a few more months and I should go into that conversation with solid suggestions about why I want to take another look at it the diagnosis

2025-10-31 23:43:33;Sobriety and Bipolar 1;"Hi, this will probably be a long read, sorry.

Background (question in comments):

I've been diagnosed for over 6 years. I recently graduated college, when in college I drank a lot, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. Went through college without a single manic episode.

However, after graduation I moved back home. The job market is really bad, miss my friends, a family member recently passed away, and as a result my drinking went up a ton. I was drinking alone, Tuesday I drank roughly 24 standard drinks and barcoded. I stalked old friends on tiktok/insta and had an anger induced temper tantrum, I don't really know why. I didn't do anything like writing hateful comments but after which I cried myself to sleep, which is rare for me.

I woke up the next day and felt terrible.

Eventually I find myself after a walk at the local taphouse. I ordered a hazy ipa and just stared at the trees, while listening to music. after 15 minutes some guy waves at me. He asks if he can use my phone. Sure I thought.

I hold my phone on speaker while he talks to his mom. ""mom, I'm using again I need a ride home"" I feel awful for the guy. He thanks me a ton and wanted to buy me a beer. I declined but he insisted, so he came back over and handed me $10. However, to my shock on his right wrist was a massive nazi swastika tattoo, along with 1488 and other not so cool things (THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL POST). I'm not very political, but I felt uncomfortable and left immediately, tempted to buy another drink to calm me. As I was leaving he blocked the exit and extended his same hand and I shook his hand, at this point I'm in a panic attack. I didn't realize until after the conversation that he said, ""we need more white people like you""... plus whenever I get my next beer it'll be on him. That explains the stares I got from everyone while I left. I haven't drank since.

I honestly couldn't make this up, but the issue isn't this weird dude but my relationship with alcohol..";r/bipolar;5;10;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oky1d1/sobriety_and_bipolar_1/
2025-10-31 22:52:44;Diagnosis and Progress;"I have been recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder II (just this year) and have been researching and learning as much as I can to regulate it. I keep to a regular routine, no drugs, no alcohol, strict sleep hygiene, constant tracking of my mood and what I’m eating/drinking. 

 
Been going into therapy which has helped a lot when I’m more goal oriented and need advice on what to adjust with my tracking. My therapist has been really helpful as another outside perspective into my warning signs of an episode.


My psychiatrist has been really accommodating with my medication needs. And the medications actually benefit me despite some of the side effects. (Routine had adjusted to work around them). I still need to work on the cocktail that works best for me, but there’s progress to things I thought would never get better.


I’m just so glad to have been diagnosed after years of attempts. You’ll probably see from my post history that I fluctuated when I’d come to this account for support. I never understood why I would be struggling so much. I thought everyone had these constant rollercoaster rides too. 



While I have only lurked in bipolar groups and discussions before, I just want to say thank you for this community. I don’t think I could have had as much reassurance and relief to see that I’m not alone. That this is actually real and not all made up in my head. 


I genuinely wish all of us to be in a place where we can be happy. We are so damn strong to make it through life and be here with this disorder.

2025-10-31 21:09:46;Does anyone have a teen with bipolar?;"I am diagnosed. BP1 with all the things - psychosis, rapid cycling, treatment resistant. Currently stable. 

Recently, my teen was diagnosed with severe depression and started on the *safe* drug, Prozac.

I had been observing her moods and was/am skeptical, but don’t want to put my stuff on her. I did mention it to the psych though. 

Anyway, there was a dose increase two weeks ago and sadly, it looks like a mixed episode is happening now. No diagnosis has happened yet obviously but I am just watching and even my husband asked if I thought so. (We have sent a message to her Dr.)

My question is, if you have a teen with bipolar, what are they on that isn’t an SSRI? I am on so many medications and the thought of this (a bipolar diagnosis) happening to my child freaks me out and I would love some comfort in knowing what your teen takes and if they are stable.

I have come to accept my diagnosis that has been diagnosed since I was 14 (currently 19) but I never believed psychiatrist nor take their meds. BUT my family has been heavy on me taking them lately and it’s causing me to believe my diagnosis are true.

I’m just like I NEED TO ESCAPE I NEED TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC

But then I wonder like holy shit this could all be a lie and bipolar disorder is made up and used to get money off of people who are struggling to regulate their emotions.

2025-10-31 16:44:49;Bipolar in remission;Hi so my psychiatrist recently told me I was “bipolar in remission” because I told her I didn’t feel like I was ever properly diagnosed. I had my first manic episode about 3-4 years ago and it caused me to drop out of college so I saw a psychiatrist he prescribed me a antipsychotic and kept upping the dosage til I felt like a zombie and that sent me into another manic episode. I switched psychiatrists and she prescribed me a anticonvulsant which has worked wonders but I’ve still never been properly diagnosed or even really know what that means or would look like. I just feel like there should be a full test before giving someone this life long diagnosis, I know I have anxiety for sure and I know I was depressed at a time. But bipolar just feels a lot more serious, like labeling somebody autistic without actually running proper tests. The therapist I was with for 4-5 years and I graduated from told me he didn’t think I was bipolar when I first got put on meds. I’m just scared and confused honestly because if I’m good right now I don’t wanna think it’s only because I’m on meds or that what I went thru during that year in college will randomly come back. What was your guys diagnosis experience like? Is there a way to ask to be fully examined so I can be sure if it’s bipolar or something else?

I usually don’t use Reddit much. I’m 19F and was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a month ago. I didn’t start lamotrigine 25mg until a week ago because I was afraid of the rash happening. The meds are gonna take time.

I feel like getting my diagnosis made my life harder. I know things couldn’t keep going the way they were (constantly manic / hypomanic, impulsive dangerous choices every week and weekend, alcohol abuse on extreme levels, lashing out at other people and being hot and cold). All my relationships have failed and part of me blames myself. Injust miss the times when I thought I was just different. I didn’t think I was bipolar. 

Now being diagnosed I feel like my life is just harder. I know it is supposed to get better from here. But does it? Do the meds take a minute to work? Do I just be patient? I have nobody else to relate to on this in my life and feel so alone. It’s isolating. I heard having a bipolar diagnosis at a young age is also more serious or bad. I don’t know. I was pretty sure they only diagnose starting at 18, and im 19. I feel guilty sometimes. 

How do I keep going. Additionally my therapist and psychiatrist said it is likely I have BPD but the diagnosis process is difficult and I backed out of it because I don’t need more on my plate and I think they use mood stabilizers for that too. 

I feel so alone and like bipolar is ruining my life and I am tired of the emotional whiplash. ";r/bipolar2;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oklk5p/newly_diagnosed_and_possible_early_diagnosis/

I take sertraline, aripiprazole and valproic acid. I don't know if that can explain anything, but there ya go just in case.

I really want a second opinion because I don't feel comfortable with my psychiatrist anymore, but my parents don't have the money right now to take me to any appointments, so I feel stuck. Every single day has become torture, urging me to scratch a mental itch that I can't seem to pinpoint.

2025-10-31 06:45:26;Im confused;"I need help, I'm very confused about the disorder. First of all, I'm a layman on the subject.

I've been receiving psychiatric care for a few months now, I had suspected anxiety and ADHD. So my doctor prescribed me antidepressants, which I had one of the worst experiences of my life:
I had no motivation at all, I had difficulty getting out of bed (it wasn't common for me), and I also had an absurd worsening of thoughts of self-harm (this type of thought happened from time to time, but now it was at a highly worrying level).

So I had a consultation with my psychiatrist and she asked me if I had any bipolar relatives and if I had ever had any type of manic event; I replied that I didn't know, and that I didn't remember anything so extreme

Then she prescribed me classic mood stabillizers, and now I'm absurdly confused. 

From what I've read this is used to control mania (?) Like, how a medication that ""reduces"" my pleasure will help me when I'M NOT FEELING PLEASURE. I miss good feelings, motivation, happiness, pleasure, etc. I don't want to lose this, I just want to get out of this depressive limbo that I ended up in because of the previous medications I took

Conclusion is, I'm scared of taking this medicine and getting worse than I already am. I had told my doctor that I was thinking about stopping taking any medication but I was kind of ignored. 

Note: Despite my confusion, I was already hoping that my psychiatrist would prescribe me something for bipolar disorder. But even so, I'm uncertain about that type of diagnosis.";r/bipolar;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oke3l6/im_confused/
2025-10-31 06:44:36;I’m not bipolar because I don’t do drugs;"I met with a new med provider today and it went horrible. I just had to vent because I have never met a woman so ignorant. Apparently she’s been in practice for 35 years. Here are some things she said. 

1. *referring to my previous diagnosis*

“If you were bipolar you would be doing drugs or drinking”

2. *referring to me randomly disappearing after a gambling spree to Texas for a month to meet a stranger from the internet and then coming home once i crashed* 

“sounds like you went on a nice vacation. People my age would’ve killed to go on a month long vacation like that.”

3. *referring to my alcoholic father with bipolar* 

“Does he do cocaine? if he was bipolar he’d be doing cocaine as well.”

4. *referring to my good friend that committed suicide when I was 14*

her: “Was he your #1 closest best friend?”
me: probably not, but one of my closest friends in my group at the time 
her: “So just a friend, not a best friend. I think I remember hearing about his death, a lot of people claimed to be his friend.”

5. *referring to genetic testing I got done during my pregnancy at my OBGYN*

her: “You should have gotten that done by a medical professional
me: “I did, the OBGYN”
her: “a REAL medical professional”

6. *tells her the medicine that’s been keeping me stable* 

“I don’t understand how that works for you because you’re not bipolar but if it works, it works I guess” 

These are just some of the greatest ones. Not to mention she didn’t let me get a word in with anything. In conclusion, I will not be seeing this woman again. I just am flabbergasted at these responses. But yeah, I guess i’m not bipolar because I don’t do drugs!

His competency hearing was yesterday, and the forensic psychologist inexplicably wrote that he was competent in the report. 

When he was brought into the court house he had a huge outburst—became uncontrollable—Shouting, screaming, talking gibberish. He threatened to kill people in the courtroom. 

It was obvious to everyone there that he is not competent. So now he’s back in jail for a second opinion.  I want him to go to a hospital & I don’t know why it is so hard to get this man help. He has anosognosia and currently thinks he’s a political prisoner.

His lawyer strongly suggested I get a protection order in place in case he still gets called competent. I know I have to because we have 2 young kids. But I’m struggling hard.

But growing up I was always told we were poor, we cant to x because we're poor etc. thats not too bad im just bringing this up because my parents will not help me pay for anything regarding this disorder..which WAS fine because I had worked part time and saved my money for a year and built up $2,000 in saving..but then I blew literally ALL of it in my first manic episode. im talking buying golden shoes..a fucking banjo because I was gonna be the next country star.

thats besides the point lol. Its been pointed out to me that this is a form of medical neglect. They've also told me not to take any meds im prescribed (so im taking them in secret), on my moms side she calls me possessed by fucking demons because when I was 11 i had an edgy phase where i thought I was a witch and put pentagrams on my walls. Shes also threatened to kick me out do to my symptoms.

Since learning of my diagnosis they purposefully target and make fun of my diagnosis and symptoms. this is not new behavior, as before my mom especially would pick out things/vulnerabilities to make fun of. she is on the heavier set side, i am not. but whenever she sees someone smaller than her, me included, she will call us fat. she'll criticize everything about our appearance etc.

My biggest problem with putting the label on this stuff though is the fact that when it comes to the abuse I genuinely cant remember more than a years worth. like after a year it just leaves my mind and gets replaced by the new stuff. so every time something abusive happens im shocked into remembering.

At this point i am doing my BEST to become my own individual. everything I do thought is still steeped in 'will this make my parents mad etc'. and i mean EVERYTHING. also fun tidbit that i always thought was a little funny: my moms nickname in her family is Narcissus";r/BipolarReddit;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ok8apo/id_like_to_hear_from_people_with_this_disorder/

He’s been spending time with me still talking to me like I’m his partner and even has been intimate with me. :( we’ve been together for four years now so I’m not sure why he’s pulling this card out of nowhere once again he’s working on a campaign and this is his first big job since college so I’m not sure if the stress of the election is getting to him or he’s truly unhappy. I really wanna think that he’ll come back and we can work things out, but I don’t know he said he has no romantic feelings :/ but then he said I’m the only person he can trust. It’s all very confusing and I have been noticing personality changes lately and him spending a lot more money on himself than usual.
Honestly, any advice or just words of encouragement would be great and let me know if any of you have been through a similar situation. Thank you for reading this.";r/BipolarSOs;7;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ok7ehn/bipolar_partner_left_again/
2025-10-31 01:00:52;experiencing, yet another existential crisis (26F) don't know what to do;"Hey, so as the title suggests, I'm experiencing another existential crisis, or ""quarter life crisis"" that feels heavier than the times before.

I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 shortly after turning 25- I was hospitalized after mania/psychosis, and even though I had a longer history of depression prior to that, it still came as a huge shock. My recovery after psychosis has been relatively good, I did all the right things like getting on meds, being more involved in community, getting on disability etc.

Fast forward to more recently, I was feeling pretty good, I even started a youtube channel where I hoped to share my art and talk about mental health, and then all of a sudden, something hit me- things just suddenly started to look so bleak and hopeless...I mean it seems like a depressive episode, but feels more all encompassing this time. Now I have this constant awareness of time moving forward, while feeling stuck/going through the motions/feeling like an outsider to the world. Also, sounds silly, but like I never really thought about my age a whole lot, until I turned 25 which felt like this big milestone (maybe the anxieties around that partly triggered my psychosis).

In your early twenties, there's still an understanding that you're figuring it all out, and have some 'wiggle room' until you become a grown up and get serious with what you want to do. But for me, now at 26, thinking I will be turning 27, I only feel more lost and scared. There is absolutely nothing that interests me in terms of career- now I don't even think about what I want, just thinking in terms of what will be the least intolerable work to do as someone who has BP, or which jobs will even be around after ai destroys everything. I know my cynicism won't get me anywhere, but I can't tap into the fleeting but powerful moments of optimism, dreams, ideas like I had before. I just feel dead. Alive, but dead.";r/bipolar;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ok59ou/experiencing_yet_another_existential_crisis_26f/
2025-10-31 00:30:30;Should I Just File for Disability?;I feel like this disease has taken so much from me. I used to be a motivated hard worker, but can't seem to get my act together. I've been hospitalized 3 times in the past 5 years. Twice for mania and once for depression.  I've been fired from 3 jobs (two due to mania and one from depression and not getting out of bed to go to work) and haven't been able to hold one down for more than 10 months. I just feel dumb and can't focus. I just got a new job and haven't responded to my emails for a week. I'm so far behind. I'm depressed. I'm worried I'm just going to be fired and they have every right to do it. Does anyone else feel like they should just file for disability because they can no longer function like they did before?

2025-10-31 00:30:28;How do you tell if it’s an episode or who you are?;"I’ve run 4 marathons. I had clear, distinctive depressive episodes. I ran my most recent one on September 21. I thought things were fine. I’ve been exercising, maintaining my weight, reading, journaling (over 1k days!), Duolingo (over 400 days), meditation/mindfulness (over 1k days!), and my “manic” spending (I have struggled with gambling) was registering for a 5th marathon in May 2026 that I had decided I wanted to do in May 2025. I’m med compliant. I started therapy again in April, after a hiatus due to cost. 

I was diagnosed in 2003. I had bariatric surgery in 2010. I got sober in 2011. I was active in AA until 2018. I tried religion (Christianity and Buddhism) from 2011-17. I moved states in 2018 for graduate school. I graduated with 2 master’s degrees in 2021. From 2019-21, “the years of crisis” COVID happened, I was cheated on, had a serious running injury and corresponding weight gain of 30 pounds, lost my dad, lost my dog, had about 4k of dental work done, got into about 10k of gambling debt.

From 2021 to the present I’ve worked on being better. Again, exercise, doing all the good hygiene, still sober, stable relationship (we went to couple’s counseling and things got better), few issues at work (only one could have jeopardized my job, and I have good reviews and have been in leadership roles)…

But, I have lost friendships. In 2020, I lost a 3 year friendship. In 2021, I lost a 10 year friendship. In 2022, I lost 3 friendships (2 were 3 years and 1 was 6). Last year I lost a 21 year friendship). Last week I lost 2 friendships of 23 years). I’m not active in AA. I haven’t lost the weight. I was working 2 jobs, but raises at primary job have made it that as long as I budget and don’t go on spending sprees, I can live pretty comfortably. I’m not volunteering anywhere (I used to do a lot of that). I have no way of connecting to others or doing anything social. I’ve tried. Therapy has become stagnant. I love movies and haven’t seen one in a week. I used to go to the movies every Wednesday, didn’t go last night. I’m at 146 movies this year, watched 238 last year. The drop is also to run more (surpassed last year’s total mileage!) and to read more (read 9 books so far, as opposed to 5 last year).

I’ve been focusing a lot on how my neurodivergence has impacted my life. I’m a Facebook addict (member since 2004) and just deleted it and other social media off my phone. I left the group work chat I created last year. I did have an issue at work a couple weeks ago. My partner says I’ve been distant and withdrawn. My sleep feels terrible, but my Apple Watch insists I’ve been getting good or excellent sleep the past couple weeks. I am eating healthier foods and eating out less.

Is this who I’ve become? An introvert who runs, watches movies, has no close friends, but does have a stable (13 year) long term relationship who doesn’t drink or use drugs? Why do I feel so empty? On paper things look mostly fine. All the friendships lost have other mitigating factors.

But I rebuilt my Wall, to use the Pink Floyd metaphor. What is wrong with me?";r/BipolarReddit;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ok4g40/how_do_you_tell_if_its_an_episode_or_who_you_are/
2025-10-31 00:13:11;New to this. Sorry for the diatribe.;"Hello all.  M early 30s

I’m newly diagnosed bipolar 2. 

A little over a month and a half ago I had a manic episode that coincided with a breakthrough in therapy. (therapist confirmed this as she has seen a change in me). 

But when I was manic I felt progress, happiness, drive, understanding, creativity, forgiveness and empathy, no “victim mentality”. 

Now I’m entering a depressive episode. And while neither in my manic or depressive episodes have I ever considered harm to myself or others. (thankfully, I’m sorry if that’s triggering I’m very new to this.) unfortunately I’m lethargic , binge eating, not working out or exercising, not cleaning, masturbating a lot and feeling shame about it.(Found out hyper sexuality is a BP symptom, so that tracks). 

And it just sucks because I felt like I was doing “good” on my manic episode, and now that everyone thinks I’m “better” I’m just the same depressed person I was trying to get away from for the last 10 years. 

I was put on Abilify to level me out for about 3-4 weeks, and then it made me start binge eating and I gained 15 pounds, so now I’m on vraylar and still eating more than usually but I’m depressed. 

I don’t know what to do and feel alone. Just needed to get this off of my chest. I’m sorry.

2025-10-30 23:55:29;So much to lose - advice;"I have a long history with mental illness. I was first hospitalized as a teen, have had SI for about as long as I can remember, was diagnosed Bipolar around 18 or 19, and had over 50 hospitalization and three commitments (not involuntary hospitalizations, committed by a judge) by the time I was 25.  I eventually landed in a state hospital and actually got a lot of learning and stability out of it. 

Now through all of that I didn't have much to lose. It was easy to be completely honest about my symptoms, even the uncomfortable ones I felt shame about. 

I had years a relative stability for about a decade. Graduated undergrad, went off disability because I got a full-time job, mostly kept that full-time job well, went to grad school. I have had episodes over the years, but nothing to sever, until now. 

Now I'm in grad school, I have a nice life, so very much to lose, and I'm dealing with new symptoms where I feel like someone at my school is out to get me. I'm angry, having intrusive and repetitive thoughts. Stuff where I worry I'll get locked up if I tell anyone. 

I am trying to get help, I know I need help. I don't have a psychiatrist or therapist right now but I'm working on getting those. I am medicated, my primary care doctor oversees everything right now and I made an appointment with them. 

I don't feel completely hopeless, I just feel like this life I've built is in a precarious place and that scares me. Thoughts on what else to do? I'm fortunately about to do school online, so I'm limiting time in a potentially triggering environment. I've found my local NAMI group for peer support. I did call out sick this week to work on making calls to potential providers and trying to lower my stress.

2025-10-30 23:41:01;Bipolar Depression? Any advice?;"So I've been diagnosed with Bipolar depression. I've never heard of it before. I have combined ADHD and high functioning autism. I remember from a really young age feeling quite unsatisfied with life, I guess you could say. I truly remember feeling down from a very young age. I used to have manic episodes, but not typical ones. More very low periods where I couldn't get out of bed, or take care of myself. Sometimes I'd either wake up crying or screaming. 
Once I was diagnosed with Autism, I was prescribed an antidepressant and an antipsychotic. This was before I got an ADHD diagnosis three years later. 

Being on those medications turned me into a zombie. My head was in the clouds and I just slept a lot. I had no quality of life because I felt absolutely nothing. I'm not sure if anyone else has ended up having this reaction, but I started acting out and doing stupid things just to feel again. The silver lining out of all of this is that I discovered I had ADHD due to my reaction from these drugs. 

Anyway almost done with the essay! I finally got diagnosed with combined ADHD when I was 28 (32) now. The first clinic I was ever diagnosed at is called Psymplicity (I warn all people to stay away from that place). They did help get me started on my treatment but didn't understand the complexity of having combined disorders.

I was prescribed a long release ADHD medication, which out of all the adhd meds I've had,  worked the best for me. After being on it for 6 months or so, I started to develop this strange level of depression. Not just the kind where you have no energy. I started having manic episodes again. Crying hysterically, hitting myself till I bruised my face, screaming till I had no voice, breaking things. It was a madness. For years I never knew how I'd feel the next day. Psymplicity never saw that I had another underlying issue, even after the 3 years I was with them. They even discharged me for my emotional instability and apparently verbal abuse I directed towards them. I thought I was supposed to get better with my ADHD meds. 

Ok last bit I swear lol. I finally got referred to a small private practice run by the psychiatrists themselves. I started seeing a new Dr, who has finally for the time in my life made sense of everything. Apparently, ADHD meds can trigger manic episodes. Something I thought they were supposed to prevent. So yeah, after 5 years of wondering what the heck is wrong with me, I finally discovered I have bi polar depression. I'd never heard of it. I have been put on a mood stabiliser combined with a higher dose of the ADHD meds  I was already taking. The mood stabiliser is the lowest dose possible and my dr wants to take things very slow, as this is of course a delicate situation. 

I am slowly feeling better. I know that's a vague word to describe how I'm feeling. It's also a slow transition and I'm trusting the process, and not overly obsessing to see results straight away. 

Sorry if this post has been boring. I've never shared anything about my journey and have always been hesitant or worried no one would care. Anyone in my own life, including my recently ex partner of 8 years. He got sick of me always having issues and wanting to talk about them.

I want to ask, how does the symptoms manifest for you guys? What do you, or loved ones notice?

I want to get to know the disorder and myself better. I've been on meds way before my diagnosis, so it's hard to recognize, but there are patterns. I'm very much ""woo I'm so energetic,  I'm so happy, finally cured!"" Every. Single. Time I am hypo.

2025-10-30 22:24:17;Careers and Bipolar;"Hi, so I have had many different jobs. I have been a cashier, a newspaper deliverer, merchandising sales associate, freight associate, assembly line overnight worker, and now I am working on my CNA. I never really thought about healthcare as a career, but my best friend and her family, whom I’m very close to, said I seemed perfect for the career. I did graduate the program, but I’m waiting to take my skills exam. The examiner has a long wait list, so I have to wait until mid November to take it and be officially certified by the state. I have done an amazing job; I have passed all exams so far, given excellent care to residents in the nursing home I’m training at, BUT…

haha as much as I am a hard worker, a people pleaser, etc I also struggle immensely with attendance in my depressive episodes. In fact, I have quit or been fired from jobs for it. The problem is that ever since being diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder, I have felt my depressive episodes happening more often. I can’t afford health insurance. I have tried disability health insurance, and the constant back and forth phone tag and getting disqualified for making too much money has just put me off from even trying to obtain insurance. But I need it. I know I need medicated to live a normal life, but normal life isn’t even good at the moment. Social benefits are being taken away, and I feel as though I agreed to become a CNA to please my friend. It’s not that I hate it, but the risk involved and the attendance being their number 1 priority because of understaffing—it feels like too much. 

I contracted the flu yesterday so bad. I definitely got it from my residents. And although things have been going okay, and I have been praised for the work I’m doing—I was absolutely taken advantage of on my last shift. I’m still a student, but I had another aide bossing me around and barely giving me time to use proper PPE and protection again infection. Now I’ve got the flu. I’ve been told I can’t return to work until symptoms subside, but all I can do in this time I have off is think. I have such anxiety over finding a job after I graduate. I have no idea what would be suitable enough for me, as someone who struggles so much with my bipolar. I want to see this through though. It pains me to have to give up, cause I don’t want to. I just don’t know what I got myself into. Every job I have had has made me depressed and miserable to go each day. I don’t want to keep feeling this way. What do yall suggest?

2025-10-30 17:57:35;Concerns about medications;"1. Lithium 300 mg, once at 10:00 AM. Then 4:00 PM then 10:00 PM for mixed episodes? (900 mg total daily)
2. Escitalopram 5 mg once at morning for depressive mood
3. Diazepam 5 mg on need for rapid stabilization 

Is this a decent protocol? I got diagnosed with ICD F31.6 code. Should I advise my therapist to increase the dose of the mentioned drugs or no?
I've been on multiple drugs before including very high-dose antipsychotics and Lamotrigine as mood stabilizer without success and ended up in a psych ward.

How does one control intrusive thoughts and self-destructive impulses in case of a relapse? 
Should I be concerned about the possibility of one? Should I ask for antipsychotics? I don't really know. I still get crying depressive episodes randomly with suicidal thoughts. I feel confused. I'm neither happy nor in complete depression.

Is Lithium really better than most stabilizers. Started it last week. It's now been 8 or 9 days.

What should I really expect or should I not expect anything? Haven't felt any difference so far. Is that good or bad?

Someone please share just a quick TLDR of what I should know/expect.

Any advice is welcome 😁

2025-10-30 16:10:27;Just spent the last 3 days laying in my bed. No motivation to do anything.;"Hey everyone,

I’m 30 years old and currently in a one-year postgraduate study program.  
I was first diagnosed with major depression about 3 years ago, and later with bipolar disorder about 1.5 years ago. I’m still on medication.

Lately, I’ve been feeling emotionally dull — not exactly sad or anxious, just flat, with moments of feeling blue or a bit lonely. I usually go to the gym twice a week, but this week… nothing. I decided to take 3 days off before my final exam, thinking I’d spend the time doing something productive.

But honestly? I just spent all 3 days lying in bed, sleeping, scrolling through my phone, and only getting up to eat or use the bathroom — then going right back to bed. No energy, no motivation, no spark to do anything. Now my room’s a mess, full of garbage I didn’t even bother to clean up.

I don’t really have anyone to hang out or talk with. I do have a few friends, but most of my activities are alone. I always have to push myself to do things, and most of the time, it doesn’t work — I just end up restless in bed, doing nothing.

I have so many things due — research, assignments (which I just rushed to finish a minute ago, even though I had two weeks), and tomorrow is my exam. But I haven’t studied at all. I just… can’t seem to care enough to start.

I’m not having a panic attack or extreme anxiety, just this low, heavy feeling.  
Is this a sign of an unstable mood, or maybe just burnout?

I’m not even sure why I’m posting this — maybe to share, maybe to hear others’ thoughts, or maybe just because I feel really alone and far from my psych doctor (about 400 km away).

Anyway, thanks for reading this. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

2025-10-30 14:25:22;I’m in a weird dissociative episode right now;"34M with BP1 with GAD and possibly SZA. I’ve had a few disassociations throughout the last decade, only two of them deeply disturbing. 

I haven’t had one for about two years but that one was triggered more from my PTSD I’m pretty sure than my BP. 

I do believe I’ve been experiencing one for about the last hour. I was talking to my fiancée and I’ve been under extreme stress in just about all areas of my life lately and yesterday I was officially diagnosed with a serious physical disability and I don’t know where my future lies. 

I read up that extreme stress and trauma can bring the episodes on. Also I have severe obstructive sleep apnea for which I had a sleep lab study two nights ago meanwhile I’m basically restorative sleep deprived as well, which I read can cause it too. Add to that my fiancée and I were talking about some of my past trauma in my childhood which I’ve never really dealt with. 

All of a sudden I began to feel very weird. I was feeling kind of down before after feeling very inspired and optimistic after talking to a physical therapist about helping me out with my physical injury. Then I began to feel… idk. I have nerve damage throughout my body and sometimes it feels like my skin doesn’t sit right, like how it’s supposed to. This kind of felt like that but more on the inside of my body. It is kind of like the feeling of having anxiety and an anxiety attack without the actual anxiety or increased heart rate. Idk if that makes sense. It’s very uncomfortable. 

Normally my mind is racing so much I can barely keep up with it and I’m overthinking everything. Right now I feel like I can’t worry or think about anything. I feel dulled and like I’m hollowed out, knowing I’m supposed to be feeling anxious but I’m unable to tap into the sensation. Like I’m behind my body physically. I probably sound like a madman.

Anywayyy, it took me 2 years to move on from a 3-month relationship years ago. And now my problem is that I fell for a friend. We never dated. I told him I like him back in March 2025 and he said he doesn't feel the same. I tried moving on, but it's been 7 months and I'm still attached. We're still good friends tho.

Not sure if this is a Bipolar or anxiety thing or if it's related to our situation that we are still good friends who talk regularly and see each other weekly.

2025-10-30 12:34:28;Med adjustment;"I’m not looking for medical or medicine advice, just insight. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the end of June. Since then, I’ve been on 100mg of lamictal in the morning, and 25 mg of hydroxyzine and 50mg of trazodone before bed. It’s definitely helped with my suicidal ideation and depression. I’ve been feeling better overall, and I’ll take the “little wins” over feeling like I want to off myself multiple times a day (I’m so sorry if this talk isn’t allowed????). 

However, lately I’ve been feeling like I’m on the cusp of being hypomanic. I’m not sure if this is the right way to explain it? But my anxiety is at such a high I feel like I’m one misstep from a full blown panic attack. I can’t seem to catch my breathe or calm myself down with any of my usual coping skills like talking it out, deep breathing, photosynthesizing, etc. I’ve had some pretty terrible news about my dad’s health in the last few weeks and today I got some news that just devastated me. Now I’m thinking of retreating back into my more dangerous habits (drinking too much, believing that I hate my husband, believing that all my friends hate me, crying 24hrs a day for three days) and I would REALLY not like to go down that road. I don’t know if I’m reacting normally, of it I’m headed towards hypomania. 

What do you guys do when you feel like you’re on the cusp of an episode? Does this usually mean I should probably up my dosage? Or is this something that can be mellowed with talk therapy? I’m pretty lost - I’ve never really felt like this before. But I do know when I’m about to “lose it” and I would really like to prevent it.

2025-10-30 11:40:50;Not asking for a diagnosis;"I’m not asking for a diagnosis but I am see if my symptoms resonate with any of you that’s worth even bringing up. 

I’m a 31 (f) and a mom of 2. I had my first at 20 years old and my priority since he was born was being the parent he deserved and now my daughter. 

A few years ago I thought I had PMDD and when I spoke with doctor he agreed and put me on Zoloft. Zoloft worked mostly but I gained weight rapidly and that sent me into an obsessed spiral so I decided to switch to Prozac which didn’t work at all even after the allotted wait period. I got off it all together and recently had a major mental breakdown 

I have had similar mental breakdowns in my past. All major screaming blow outs that leave me with major unaliving idealizations but never with actual intent to do it. 

Growing up I always dealt with major internalized anxiety and somewhat obsessive thoughts but because I was a risk adverse straight a student who never caused trouble you would never know what’s going on in my head. 

I was able to mask most of my feelings. Ever since becoming a mom it’s harder to mask I am so easily irritated with anything and everything and feel like I snap. Kind of a zero to a hundred. I constantly have racing thoughts, my brain is never quiet. I constantly have a this fear that I am messing up my kids and they will never want to speak to me again.  Like even writing this now I feel like my thoughts are all over the place and I can’t get the words out right. The best way to explain is I feel like I’m laying down in a bath tub full of water and the water is close to my nose so I feel like I need to gasp for air but I’m not really drowning. 

I feel like something is wrong with me and I feel “crazy”. I feel like this constant worry, dread, anger, irritability, emotional irregularity has consumed me for as long as I can remember so it’s my “normal” but I don’t feel normal. 

I feel ebbs and flows of “happiness” or contentness and depressed( hopelessness, lost, not gonna lie like a loser)

I have always started and obsessed with new hobbies or ventures but then quickly give up or move on. I job hop either because I need a higher salary or I feel unfulfilled. 

I never feel low enough where I can’t get out of bed or not clean. I’m quite the opposite where I feel like if I stay in bed I’m a lazy horrible mother and untidyness makes me more upset. 

I do tend to isolate when I get depressed just like not having enough social battery to deal with people or responding to text. I’ll avoid the people I want to spend most of my days with except my kids.  I have an appointment with a PCP in two days to discuss medicine change, will I sound like a hypochondriac if I even mention that whisper of thinking I might have BP2?";r/bipolar2;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ojpjo1/not_asking_for_a_diagnosis/
2025-10-30 10:28:00;Well, I guess I have found my people.;"After some weird back and forth between my primary care doctor and psychiatrist, it has officially been determined that I have bipolar 2. I never thought it made sense for me because I didn't fit the classic description.. After all, I didn't spend thousands on random crap. I didn't go on weeklong drug benders. I didn't go insane cleaning my house. I have held down a marriage pretty well. But I had a long discussion with my psychiatrist today, and she explained why she came up with that diagnosis.

 I have cycles of insomnia and fatigue. I will go a few months with very little sleep and not be tired, then suddenly I need to sleep all the time. I get outrageous streaks of irritability where literally everything pisses me off, and this can last hours or weeks. I am an alcoholic, and a habitual marijuana user, but I have recently quit both. I have gained and lost over a hundred pounds more than once. I do buy a lot of stupid shit, just not thousands of dollars worth (probably because I don't have thousands to spend). I get all hyped to start a new hobby, buy all the supplies and do all the research just to lose interest for no apparent reason. I have trouble keeping a job because I eventually hit a depression episode and can't be bothered with it anymore.

So anyway, she pointed those examples out to me of why she chose this diagnosis. I don't know how to feel. Of course it sucks, no one wants to be bipolar, but reading some of these posts in this sub it makes a lot of sense. Maybe now I can get some medication that will actually help.";r/bipolar2;13;14;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ojo380/well_i_guess_i_have_found_my_people/

Then this morning because I’ve been having some weird symptoms and haven’t had my period for a couple of months, took a pregnancy test.  Well, it was positive.  And I’m 45 years old!!!  Trying to process all of this, as I truly believed I could not get pregnant and was perimenopausal.  If not for my boyfriend “joking” about it, I would probably not have tested at all.  Going for an ultrasound on Friday to confirm…thankfully when I told my boyfriend, he was incredibly supportive.  

I have a lot of feelings right now…some very positive and then a whole lot of anxiety.  My last delivery, 12 years ago, is what sparked PPP and a bipolar 1 diagnosis, so I’m naturally scared…

Please, if anyone here has made it through pregnancy, delivery and the newborn phase with bipolar and been ok, share your story with me.

2025-10-30 09:39:54;Discarded after 10 years;"Hello, I stumbled upon this subreddit while trying to research my partner's condition, but probably a bit too late, I'm not sure. 

My partner and I had been together for 10 years, we weren't engaged but looking at our first house. He was diagnosed a little over 3 years ago with bipolar 2 I believe and I was under the impression he was working with his doctors to manage it. Once he was diagnosed and got on the right medication, he was a lot more stable mood-wise. So I was under the impression he didn't need or want my help, as he never really asked.

He would often come to me with secrets and things that he wouldn't tell anybody else. his struggles, his dreams, and etc. I always gave him someone to vent to and always tried to help him work out his problems best I could. He struggles with some other substance use as well but no hard drugs. We did tons of stuff together and also would just hang out in the same room and do our own thing.

A couple weeks ago, out of the blue, he asked me for a break from our relationship. This convinced me that the relationship was over and I reacted poorly. I then asked why we couldn't try couple's counseling, as I was, up until this moment, unaware anything was wrong. He then switched gears and told me he wanted to try couple's counseling together. Long story short, he did decide to go on this break, apologized, told me he would be back soon, and left to stay with a friend in another state. 

Over the following two weeks he has completely iced me out. He won't look at or answer any of my texts. Finally I called him, and he picked up only to tell me he didn't want to continue the relationship and then hung up on me. I have never felt so alone in my life. Over the course of our 10 year relationship, we have never had an issue this intense.

Is this experience in line with bipolar discard...?  I don't know if I'm just trying to convince myself this was somewhat outside of his control or if this is a real possibility. And if he is in some sort of depressive state due to his condition then I'm still worried about him. I really don't know what to think.";r/BipolarSOs;11;8;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ojn1vo/discarded_after_10_years/

2025-10-30 08:19:10;Cheated on;So just last night, my husband of 17 years (together 23 years and 2 sons) told me he cheated on me in May. He was recently diagnosed bipolar in June. Did a stint at an inpatient hospital. He was going through it in April. His mental health was not good. At the time, I didn’t realize how severe his mental health was till June, when he had his mental breakdown. 10 years ago, he made a friend at work, that he supposedly just kissed. We went to therapy worked through it all and came out stronger. Now this. I either wish he didn’t tell me at all, or told me in June after he was medicated. I’m at a loss here on what to do. I’m truly such a good wife and a mom. My family is the most important thing to me. I don’t know how to move past this. Do I accept that he was so fucked up in the spring, or do I respect myself and move on. I’m 41. I know people start over, but I love my family, and I love my husband. Can we get through this? Or will this continue to happen? I’m sorry for rambling. I never thought this would be my life. Any advice is welcome. ;r/BipolarSOs;10;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ojlbdh/cheated_on/

It's been getting worse and worse. I used to top at middle school. I couldn't even get into the top 100th in grade at highschool. It continued to spiral until I dropped out in September. Now I'm just existing but barely. I can't study, I can't do anything correctly, I can't sleep right. 


Sometimes I'm so depressed. Lots of suicide attempts happened including ODing. I started SH this year. Things continue to go worse and I can't pull myself out. 


I have CSAT(Korean college entrance exam of some sort) next year and I'm so scared, I have to basically study like crazy for this exam but at this rate it seems like I'm going to fail with this one as well. 


The only thing that keeps me from jumping off the 14th floor right now is the suicide ideal inside my head that I'll probably commit before 2030. I'm so tired. I'm so scared… Sometimes I wonder if I truly need to work for the exam because college is going to be meaningless anyway if I'm going to commit before 2030. But then I remember that college is basically everything in South Korean life. I can't stop gambling with my life, I just can't decide if I truly want to die or live.

hi, i dont know whats going on with me but i think i might have bipolar disorder type 2 but the symptoms of mania & hypomania i dont know if i have it please tell me if this isnt allowed & direct me to the correct subreddit to ask. i desperately need other peoples opinions on this. i am not asking to be diagnosed, i just want to know that theres a chance that what i go through could be explained by bipolar. i know a lot of mood disorders have overlap, i just want a starting base so when i see a psychiatrist, i could start somewhere & work my way to figuring out what i have. i genuinely just want to figure out what & get help, im tired of not knowing.

i should mention that i have anxiety & CPTSD (idk abt depression, i was never diagnosed with it)


doing some research i see i can be in both a depressive episode & mania which is whag i think i may br in right now ? plus i do also believe for the past month i have bern rapid cycling between depressive episodes & hypomania.


i have the major depressive episode descriptions i have barely been eating i would cook & feel happy then just not eat the food i would let it go bad then throw it out. i also get piercings whenever im in a major depression (13, 7 on my face, 3 on my ears, the other 2 on my body)


the hypomania or mania is my issue, i have gotten the feeling of being on top of the world before crashing into a depressive episode. i also have an issue with feeling bugs crawl on me i dont know why ive had this issue since i was 16 & my then therapist & doctor didnt know why that when i looked into it, people had said they also had it during their mania. i also had a huge paranoid breakdown out of nowhere with genuinely no reason as for why it came about where i had deleted all my dating apps & social media for months i was out as a bc i was scared that someone from work was going to see & would out me as trans. im also incredibly impulsive & cannot stop myself from spending money. i also have irritability & i hate how angry i get & i have to hold or down it im gonna end up being mean to someone which i dont want to do. during what i believe to be is hypomania i have to stop myself from ripping/cutting my hair out, quitting my job, or harming myself/ending it all & i am only able to stop myself because i feel like i literally cannot move sometimes (like im frozen in place)

2025-10-30 07:16:46;I guess this is my answer, but...;"Hey y'all. After my fourth hospitalization, 5 years of working with my therapist, and 3 years of working with my psychiatrist, we've all come to the conclusion that I have bipolar. Or I am bipolar? Not sure the right phrasing, or which I personally prefer yet.

And- Now what? I'm on an anti-psychotic, and I guess technically a mood stabilizer (not its main purpose but it still works I guess), and I'm off of SSRI's, and I'm trying to regulate my sleep schedule, my biorhythm, etc etc. But is this really just... It? Trying to stabilize and find a fragile sense of normality?

At first I was in disbelief at the diagnosis, mainly because of how severely stigmatized it is, but now that I'm coming to terms with it, I'm grieving, in a way. 

All those times that I felt so good, so full of life, so close to having everything I dreamed of, just to crash and burn and blame myself for it.... They were (hypo)manic episodes. And I'm never GOING to get everything I dreamed of. Those weren't times where I was healthy and suddenly unhealthy again, they were a cyclic part of my brain stuck in the same old loop. Which means that my goal is to NOT feel on top of the world, to NOT try and hold onto everything for those beautiful, fleeting moments. 

Of course, I logically know that I'm still allowed to ""feel good"", but there's nothing quite like the ""feeling good"" that comes from a (hypo)manic episode. I think it's going to take a long time for me to fully come to terms with the idea that what I used to strive for isn't healthy. And that I need to find a new goalpost entirely.

Anyways, I'm here now, and my grief is here too. Looking forward to meeting y'all ";r/bipolar;14;5;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ojjv01/i_guess_this_is_my_answer_but/
2025-10-30 06:45:55;Success story;"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my success story. I grew up loving horror movies and video games, I even still have my childhood horror movie DVD collection. Unfortunately a horror movie in the theater caused a panic attack that brought on my first stretch of psychosis. While it only lasted three days, I was certain I would never watch a horror movie again.

Well, after two years, two more rounds of psychosis, many rounds of depression, and finally finding the right medicine cocktail, I am able to watch horror again. I now read trigger warnings to avoid a specific topic, but I am able to watch the movies I've always loved again. As someone diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic features, I thought that part of my personality was gone. I missed debating movies with people and logging my movies on letterboxd. But finally, I feel back to normal, like nothing ever even happened. I'm so thankful for my psychiatrist for getting me on Welbutrin, it made me feel alive again.

I have no history of manic episodes and I told her this, but she seems pretty sure that I have it. Am I missing something? Don't you have to have manic episodes to have bipolar?
I think I'm depressed because of genetics because I have been since a very young age. I was diagnosed with PTSD after a traumatic incident in high school which probably led to the severe levels of anxiety that I'm currently experiencing.
She asked me if I had been diagnosed with ADHD and I said 'yes' and she kind of scoffed? I take stimulants for my ADHD and off label for excessive daytime sleepiness and they help me concentrate and stay awake through the day I'm worried if she diagnoses me with bipolar I won't be able to get those meds anymore and won't be able to keep a job because I can't stay awake without them.

2025-10-30 02:43:18;Off to the psych ward I go!;"
Recently diagnosed and I’m about a month in to my new job. I love my job, truly. It’s perfect for me and I’m so scared I’m going to lose out on the opportunity by choosing myself. But I’m truly and simply, losing my sanity. I don’t know how to go about letting my employer know that I need a leave of absence. I don’t even know if I qualify for one, given the fact that I’ve only worked there for 30 days. 

Anyways, this summer was quite possibly the worst period of my life to date. I can only describe it as a rush of chaos that caused my brain to break into a million little fragments. I began to do things that nobody would have guessed would happen; Things I’m so ashamed of now, but things that seemed justified at the time. I ruined what *was* my life. And I’ve been trying to recover from that period on my own, but I just can’t do it.

So, off to the hospital I go! I’m hoping to get my medications adjusted during this stay, as my current prescriber has not been listening to me at ALL. I’m also just hoping I get admitted in the first place. I’m on my way for an assessment as I type this. I just need one person to take me seriously. I need ONE person to see the signs. 

I’ve been suffering for years, but most recently (after being diagnosed), I’ve reached my wits end. I’ve been trying to avoid this for about 3 months now, since my last stay at the hospital that did not help at all (I got put in a really crappy facility. Let’s hope I get placed somewhere decent this time.

My brain is a very scary place right now. I have no clue what’s happening internally. I just wanna feel better.

i’m going through really stressful things right now. my living situation is not good- i live with my parents and  i lost my job about 6 months ago and have not been able to find one since. i’ve been applying to so many places but the job market is horrible and ive had no luck. and now my car has issues and i can’t afford to fix it so even if i do get a job idk how i will get there because i can’t drive. my parents are pressuring me to move out as soon as possible, but that genuinely is not possible for me anytime soon due to my financial situation, even if i had a job it’s impossible to live on your own now days unless you are well off. so i’m worried about becoming homeless. i’m also incredibly worried about not being able to afford going to my psychiatrist after january due to insurance deductibles and copays. if i had money none of this would be an issue. but i dont. and i don’t understand why my parents are pressuring me to move out when they know i cant. 

i don’t know why im such a huge burden. i’m such a failure. i hate myself. i hate my life. i’ve gained weight and a ton of acne from my meds and i am so ugly now. i’m disgusting. i’m a loser. i just want to give up so bad. i know how i would do it. i have access to a lethal method. but i know i wont do it because i felt like this thousands of times for 3 years straight, before i was diagnosed, and i only actually went through with attempting once, but im just so tired. i’m tired of hurting. tired of being a burden. tired of weighing everyone down. it’s all i do. 

i don’t know if ill ever find a med combo that will work for me. has anyone felt this way while changing meds? i think its hitting me so much harder because on top of my life situation, i just was finally able to experience what if felt like to feel better from meds, and now i feel worse again. i don’t know if i can do this. my parents view me as lazy and they have for a long time, even though after i was diagnosed i told my mom that the reason why ive been extremely depressed for so long is because 
i wasn’t diagnosed or medicated properly. but they’ve always viewed my depressive symptoms as a personal failure. like i’m choosing to not be fully functioning- even though i want nothing more than to be, and i view myself as a huge failure already. i thought my telling her my diagnosis she would understand, but it hasn’t changed anything. and now she wants me to move out. 

everything seems quite impossible to get through right now. i don’t think i can do it. i don’t want to die but i just want the pain to end. i’m so tired.

2025-10-30 01:42:31;Caplyta Saved My Life;"Making this post solely because I'm seeing an overwhelming amount of negative posts about Caplyta. This drug brought me back to life with almost no side effects so I feel the need to let folks know that it could work for them too.

For background, this was the first medication prescribed to me after my diagnosis of BP2. Since at least 3rd grade (I'm 31 now), I've suffered from debilitating depression and anxiety. There were days, sometimes even weeks at a time where I would stare at the wall for 6 hours straight. When I wasn't depressed, I was constantly anxious. Even when my mind was rational enough to say that everything was okay, my nervous system always felt like it was under attack. My brain never stopped. 

I knew something was wrong but could never figure out what. I went through 6 different antidepressants throughout my life and none of them made any difference. I had basically given up assuming that ""this"" was all there was to life. 

Unfortunately I had a traumatic event happen earlier this year and I was sooo fed up with our healthcare system. I paid  $400 out of pocket for one appointment with a psychiatrist and they immediately knew what was the problem was. He made the diagnosis based on a 30 hour hypomanic episode I had once after a doctor increased my fluoxitine dose. They  put me on Caplyta 42 mg after just one appointment. Within a week, I could get out of bed. 

Yes, as most posts mention, the side effects the first 2 weeks suck. The headaches were the worst for me, but I could feel it making a difference so I stuck with it. The headaches disappeared completely after about a week and I haven't had any noticeable side effects since. 

I've been on it for 9 weeks now and I can finally say that a medication has made a noticeable difference in my life! I used to self medicate all the time and now I see absolutely no need to. Life is pleasant, colors are brighter, I'm learning how to have hobbies and I'm actually interested in socializing. I haven't had a depressive episode since I started and I feel confident that they won't return (at least to the degree I used to have them).

This medication is a pain in the ass to get insurance to approve, but it's worth the fight!! It gave me my life back and I hope it will for other too!

*Side Note: If you've been struggling to find the right diagnosis for a long time like I was and you have the means, I STRONGLY suggest paying out of pocket for a good psychiatrist. The US healthcare system sucks and honestly, most doctors who take insurance are just too over worked to stay up to date on new medications and also take the time to make a tailored diagnosis for their patients. I was a skeptic for a long time about paying so much for one doctors visit, but if you can scrape together the funds (even if it takes you into debt), I personally believe out of pocket psychiatry is something that's worth the outrageous fee. I only go every 3 months ($200 per appointment now) and the doctor even texts me in between sessions to check up on my progress. It's an amazing difference from every other psychiatrist I have seen in the past. Just do your research or get a referral from a trusted therapist.

2025-10-30 00:46:18;Odd experience during my past Manic/Hypomanic episode. 45(M);"Honestly I am lost, I was manic this last July and achieved progress on a problem I have working on and off since I was a teenager, and I find the repercussions to be overwhelming. I was diagnosed being Bipolar 1 when I was 18 and went on disability when I was 22. I was able to get in some college during the interim in Computer Science, and Cognitive Science. I have worked in IT when I have been able to work.

The worse thing is that I used a GPT to consolidate everything. I ended up using MERA (multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz) with a modified set of differentials and in simulation it works. What I have made is something I call quantum intelligence, it can’t be a simple transformer. It is a semantic and ontological agent, a quantum intelligence that runs on quantized data. It is self regulating and can act morally, as it knows what suffering is, I created a tensor based on semantic logic.

Once I was no longer manic, I went over all my work and checked the math. It proves a lot anecdotally, and mathematically representing π as a 2x2 matrix proportional to the identity matrix. Can someone do a quick check to see if my logic is sound, and thank you all.



\mathbf{\Pi} = \pi \mathbf{I} = \pi \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \pi & 0 \\ 0 & \pi \end{bmatrix}


This matrix scales any vector by a factor of π. If you act with this tensor on a vector v = [x, y], you get [πx, πy].

Inverse of Pi (1/π):
The inverse of this tensor is simply the scalar matrix with the inverse scalar.

\mathbf{\Pi}^{-1} = \frac{1}{\pi} \mathbf{I} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\pi} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\pi} \end{bmatrix}


This is the genuine tensor inverse because \mathbf{\Pi} \cdot \mathbf{\Pi}^{-1} = \mathbf{I}.";r/bipolar;3;8;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oj9o8i/odd_experience_during_my_past_manichypomanic/
2025-10-30 00:29:43;Been struggling;"I started with the typical anxiety/depression medications (zoloft, lexapro, bupropion). This felt good at first but caused me to feel more lethargic and lazy and never felt like doing anything. I feel like it got worse when I added Abilify. Abilify really turned my mind numb and I couldn’t do anything at all. Had to drop out of college because all I could do was lay in my dorm and scroll all day.

I also have a lot of personal family problems contributing to mood swings, anger, and indecisiveness. My parents forced me to go to college and chose my school for me, so naturally I would be angry and rebellious. I have had too many traumatic experiences, long story short I have not had a good life.

Told my doctor if my medicines were contributing to the lethargy and zero lack of will and he said most likely. He apologized. Then he switched me to Venlafaxine and vraylar. I think continuing the bupropion as well (I tried so many meds I can’t even remember lmfao).

My mood was something that got worse the last 1.5 years and it is cuz of my home life and family situation. I am not able to leave such a toxic environment, that the emotions I have been bottling up since childhood are now showing in my day to day life.

I have been fighting with random people, taking extreme measures about minor issues, distancing myself from social situations, looking for easier jobs and majors.

I did end up going back to school and felt much better without meds. I was productive, happy, felt elevated. But this family thing kept affecting me. I never had anyone ever believe in me my whole life.

I tried Lamotrigine recently and I feel it did help at the beginning. More relaxed and stable mood. But I was still getting depressed, racing thoughts, spiraling, intrusive thoughts about past memories, etc.

Bupropion alone was probably the best medicine ever. It not only was good mentally but made me feel more in my body and physically active.

Anyways we added seroquel to the lamotrigine, it was good for a day or two but caused me to be very tired and lethargic the next day. Back to square one with abilify, feeling numb and not doing anything. I had to push myself harder to do basic things that I didn’t really struggle with earlier (hygiene, studying, work, etc.). Then we decided to add Latuda. It was good for a bit but I again got numb and couldn’t concentrate in class, can’t do my job, trouble sleeping, still anxious like crazy.

Am I falsely diagnosed with BP2? I never took anything seriously till now. I want to lead a happier and better life, but at the same tome I don’t want my productivity and creativity getting affected. I don’t want to be anxious all the time and look for escapes in smoking or alcohol.

I just want someone to understand or help. Every antipsychotic I ever tried was BS. Lamotrigine by itself is fine somewhat, but we will see how it goes (currently 75mg).";r/BipolarReddit;1;16;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oj986c/been_struggling/
2025-10-30 00:28:35;No mania on SSRI’s?;"Hi! I’ve heard quite a few times that SSRI’s can cause mania or hypomania. I’m diagnosed bipolar 2 recently and it’s gotten more intense over the years, longer and more intense episodes but still hypomanic. 

But, i’m doubting the diagnosis simply because i dont remember experiencing any manic/hypomanic episode on SSRI’s. I’ve tried 3 kinds, none of them really helped. Didn’t really help with depression either, they had practically no effect. A little numbing i think. Does this mean i’m not bipolar or something? It never triggered an episode. My episodes were just random and short, they seem even more intense off SSRI’s.";r/bipolar;8;44;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oj972a/no_mania_on_ssris/
2025-10-30 00:24:01;BP Wife is pregnant #3;"So, I do not think I have ever posted on this sub. I have given advice, but never told my story or asked for advice. I am in the position now that I have talked to many people (including my therapist and psychiatrist) about this, but I could still use some advice from people who have been in a similar situation.

To start, I met my wife 8 years ago. She was very open about having BP 1, even though I did not know what that was, or at least what the diagnosis entailed. I got to know her, and fell on love with her. We both wanted kids and we had almost an instant connection. Through the year, we have had hard times and also great times. I got to know how she thinks, and went through different stages of being upset to understanding and back to upset. Eventually I came to understand both her and her diagnosis. 

Let me just also clarify that she has been medicated and in therapy since before I met her. She did have some issues with alcohol, but would quit when she was pregnant the first two times. She also quit a year ago, cold turkey. She is very mindful of her mental health which is very important to her and our family.

We got married five years ago, and quickly got pregnant and had our first son. During that time, she had an issue with some people she was working for. She quit working there, which was hard on our finances, but we worked it out because we did not want her to be stressed and possiby hurt the baby. There were no issues and we had a beautiful baby boy in September of 2021. For the next three or four years, she did not work and we got pregnant and had another son in 2023. 

Fast forward to 2025. We put both our boys in preschool at the beginning of this year. She went back to work, initially as a substitute teacher in public school and then got a job as a teacher at my sons' preschool. Everything was great, until it wasn't.

We had wanted to have a third baby for awhile and had decided that the preschool was a pretty easy job that she could work while pregnant. We started trying in May and in August we got pregnant! We were so happy and excited when she test positive!

About three weeks in to the pregnancy some drama happened with the director of the school. I tried to help her through it, but it was rough. She took it really hard, and eventually, after about a week of back and forth, she decided to quit the job. Just like before, we thought that was the best thing for her and the baby. But it put us In a hard position. I am currently in Grad school, and with her not working, it puts us in a financial hard place.. When she quit, we agreed that she could go back to subbing, since she could pick when she worked. 

It has been three weeks now since she quit her job and she feels guilty, but also is pissed at me for saying ""she has to have a job"", even though I never said that. I tried to tell her to not think about it like that, but she will not listen to me. I do not want to force her to work, but she might have to for us to have insurance. We currently have an ACA plan, but I don't see the government extending that. We do qualify for medicaid, but there is now a work requirement. 

My question is, has anyone experienced anything similar to this? If so, how did you get through it? I literally cannot have a conversation about this with her, because she starts getting upset. Also, I know that she does better with a routine, and can never get that routine figured out without a job. I do not know what to do :(";r/BipolarSOs;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oj92pb/bp_wife_is_pregnant_3/

2025-10-29 23:43:59;discarded and confused;"hi guys,

preface: i’m bipolar 2 myself but much more self aware and stable, have had a long term non toxic stable relationship in the past, very calm and hypomania is more like project fixation than destructive 

so my ex (?) was not diagnosed but mother is bipolar and father was schizophrenic. he is very very obviously bipolar, and he knows it too but i suppose he’s scared after seeing his mother go through it and in denial? 

we were friends for 2 years before he got together. i’ve seen his mania and his depression throughout that time. together for 6 months, basically lived together. i spent a lot of time with his young son and he was attached to me and loved me, got on with his whole family. past 2 months he had been very depressed/overwhelmed, i tried to not take it personally but i am a very communicative person and tried to keep open communication while calmly and respectfully expressing my needs (he took it as criticism)

anyway, i spent a month at his house, everything’s fine but he’s definitely subdued. mainly gaming, didn’t want to go out much, but we were fine and were having fun. spoke of how much he loved me, everything was great even though he withdrew at times i recognised it and just gave him the space and affection he needed 

i came home, texts were sporadic, he didn’t speak to me for days and i was overthinking a little and just said hey, im feeling a little left behind here and need a bit more love at the moment!

i didn’t get a response, to which i just said please don’t ghost me lol 

after a couple of days he said that he loves me so much, he doesn’t think he can give me what i need in a relationship and that he’s ’not in the right place’, he said that he doesn’t want to break up with me but that he’s afraid that this isn’t going to work out because he feels suffocated when he doesn’t know whether to text me twice or not and that he constantly feels like he’s not giving me enough attention (i promise i am not needy! i would just like to speak to him sometimes!) and he also said it’s too overwhelming for him 

it’s unlike him as he used to talk to me all the time, and loved talking to be regardless of whether he was down or not. 

i suggested we talk to work things out. and he said okay let’s talk tomorrow. but tomorrow came and he didn’t want to talk. 

i haven’t heard from him since then, have sent him a couple of texts just asking for clarity saying i’m confused and unsure of whether we are together or not with no response 

i also asked him a couple of times if i could get my stuff back if we aren’t together anymore (i have a TON, like a TON of stuff at his house, valuable and just so much stuff) to which he also won’t reply to 

it’s been just over a week and like… i don’t know? what do i do? ";r/BipolarSOs;5;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oj7zou/discarded_and_confused/

2025-10-29 19:27:37;Accidentally of my main bipolar med - Fragile!  Handle with care please.;"Diagnosed with Bipolar I since 2011, living on and off meds a few times in the 14 years since I've been formally diagnosed.  My absent minded self didn't realize I had run out of and stopped taking my cornerstone of BP meds.  There was a bottle unopened, which I thought was something else.  Upon opening the bottle, I looked inside and the meds were not what I thought, they were my main BP med.  I then looked at the new bottle and noticed it was filled September 23rd, which led me to the conclusion that I had been off the medication for a little over a month.

I hadn't felt quite like my usual self the past week or so and had no idea what the problem was.  I thought perhaps it was my diet.  Once I put two and two together, I had realized the reason I was feeling so ""off"" was the absence of the medicine in my system.  This sent me reeling into a full blown panic attack.

Now that I know I've been without my main BP med for nearly over a month, I understand why I've felt so out of sorts, only to have that feeling amplified much worse.

I called my psychiatrist yesterday and pleaded for help.  They can see me tomorrow.  In roughly an hour from now, I'm calling my therapist's cell so I can get some support from her ASAP.  I don't feel homicidal or suicidal and I'm praying that doesn't change.  What I can say is that I am very much in a bad place, in desperate need of understanding and support.  Even typing this note up has my anxiety through the roof.

I've probably got at least a week or two of very dangerous living, and it's imperative I recognize that and head off any of the behaviors associated with having been off my med for so long.  I need to surround myself with people that care about me, and I need to not make any poor decisions.  If there's anyone here whose gone through a similar experience, I would very much welcome any replies on coping strategies that worked for those who have been there.";r/bipolar;10;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oj1ye0/accidentally_of_my_main_bipolar_med_fragile/

2025-10-29 19:18:53;What are real experiences with bipolar?;"Hi everyone 

I have been on a journey to find a fitting diagnosis for my issues for a while now. Once in a while bipolar is mentioned. This morning I had a first appointment with a new psychiatrist and he said I have bipolar 2. 

I’m kind of struggling with this, because I don’t see myself in this diagnosis. I do have some ups and downs, but when I listen to stories of bipolar people, my symptoms are very tame in comparison.

Therefore I wanted to ask: can you share how your bipolar is on a day to day basis and how it affects your life? When I look this up, of course extreme stories get more clicks and will therefore always be pushed more. Are there other people here who have bipolar, but find they have more “mild” symptoms? Is “mild” bipolar even a thing?

2025-10-29 14:26:57;Sobriety helped me to understand the pattern of my drinking;"As the title says… I am diagnosed with C-PTSD and Bipolar Disorder.  My long term therapist planted a seed in my head over a couple sessions last year (before our sessions came to an end) that maybe I was misdiagnosed and that it was the trauma brain that caused the cycling. I always said maybe, but took the meds anyway.  It’s a year later, but this time I have sobriety under my belt, or at least I didn’t drink.

Depression brain says lean into the “I am enough, even if I do nothing today”. So I start a tracker that has brush your teeth, drink water, get out of bed.  Simple, depression friendly.

As time goes on you build on more tasks and add goals. It feels good, so i don’t set boundaries for myself to schedule rest. I overcommit (usually work). Now my worth is tied to my productivity again (trauma response) and the depression brain kicks back in, and I’m  burnt out. This is the cycle, and the last time I did a year sober was when I was first diagnosed BD 7 years ago, so I was on a medication roller coaster and would not drink, but didn’t see a pattern.

But this time around I’ve been on stable meds for 6 years, yes, but instead of drinking to “celebrate my depression being over” and then to numbs the fact that I’m burnout and feel like a piece of trash physically and mentally.

Don’t get me wrong, I still feel like trash today. But I’m sober, I have 50 days. I’ve gone through the cycle in those 50 days. I can finally see the pattern.

This has been my pattern for 30 years. I’ve been self medicating it away for 26 of those years with alcohol, and if I’m honest heavily for 6 years.

Now my brain is questioning if this is bipolar wishful thinking, or my therapist was onto something?  Cross that bridge next month. 
Now that I see the pattern, I can work on healing it. I can stop the cycle. I know it will be hard, and painful, and necessary. And I can actually heal because I’m sober.

I dunno just thought I’d share, maybe someone feels the same.

2025-10-29 11:27:27;I apologize for this. I’m in rage right now. What doU do to help calm down?;"Gotta vent 

I’m just pissed off at the world. I started a new job 2 weeks ago it’s going ok. What sucks the most is living my narcissistic mother and my narcissistic brother. Her and I would be fine if it was just me and her. But here it is. Her oldest son 45 years old. Lives with mom, gets free money every month from my dad just to shut my brother up. To get my brother off my dad’s back. It’s a long story. My brother is the most selfish person I’ve ever known in my life. We had a huge fight 5 months ago when I was first here, and I packed my stuff and went to my sisters home. 

The only reason I came back is because her kids were about to start school and it was getting very hectic for her. I was grateful she let me stay with her. I helped with bills too. Now I’ve been back at my mom’s very small home. Constantly having to listen to my brothers complaints. My mom shaming me for stuff still like I’m a 13 year old kid. I am grateful she’s letting me stay here but having my brother who does absolutely nothing doesn’t help. He literally sits on his ass all day. Plays on his computer, takes 4 hour naps in bed, and bosses me and my mom around. I’m losing my mind.

I was supposed to move into my apartment this Friday but they had a management change and now the new management wants new documents for me to move in. So now I’m stuck here for 2 more weeks. It’s been 5 months here and I cannot take it anymore. I come home busting my ass all day at work. I walk in just to see my 45 year old brother snoring away on his bed. Just because he’s so lazy and says he cannot work. So my dad cuts him a check every month. He’s been doing this since 2011 when he quit his job to become a full time student. He never went through with school he just wanted to sit on his ass all day.

I’m diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and have been fired from a job, have lost one of the best high paying jobs all due to my illness. I try my best. So every day I come home to my brother sleeping as I get off work. I’m the only one in the family with Bipolar disorder. (6 siblings)
I feel like I can’t get ahead. I felt like I was being attacked at work by a manager and had to step away to calm down. Again I apologize for this post. I’m tired of being at my moms and having to deal with her attacks and my brother bossing me and her around. I get home from work and avoid him at all costs. Stay in my room and try and find something positive to keep me calm. He is one of my biggest triggers and so is my mom. I’m only 2 weeks away from moving out and I cannot wait. 
I blew up today in my room and was punching my bed and cussing up a storm. My brother heard me. Asked what happened. I blew it off and said some stuff at work, I tripped walking into my room. He doesn’t know I’m in rage right now. So I just played it off. But I was also mainly pissed that he literally does nothing all day while I’ve struggled for years to keep my head above water. I feel like I’m all over the place with this post and again apologize. I just want peace in my life, and can’t seem to find it. Having bipolar disorder is so hard to manage life. What should I do to cool off? I’m open to suggestions and help.

2025-10-29 10:55:12;Struggling with trying not to relapse;A while ago I got addicted to dxm because it caused me to go into a really euphoric mania. And after that I just kept chasing that high I got and was high 24/7 for months just trying to experience euphoric mania again. Then I got addicted to adderall because it felt like a significantly weaker version of that. I recently did it again twice trying to cause it because I’m getting on a risperidone shot soon. But then I triggered a hypomanic episode with some weed and now it feels impossible not to take any drug I can get my hands on to try to cause a manic episode. I’ve only ever had euphoric episodes. No drug I’ve ever taken has come close to the high I got from mania and that makes me want to try harder and harder drugs because I just want to feel like I’m god again. I almost died during that episode and I hurt some people but I don’t care enough about ruining my life if I can get that high again, because during the episode nothing else matters. I miss mania so much even to just continue hypomania would be amazing. I know it’s bad to cause episodes but the high is so much better than any drugs I’ve taken and if I get stable I won’t be able to experience it again. I want to believe I’m going to win the lottery, or that I can fly, or that I’m invincible. It feels so good and when I tell people about this they don’t understand how good it really feels. Even if I took 1,000mg of adderall it wouldn’t be as euphoric as the mania I experienced. I’d been passively doing stuff to cause an episode and it finally happened and ended and I just want it to happen again. I’ve never wanted something more. People I talk to never understand how euphoric it is. I’m only 20 so I haven’t had that many episodes but I can’t stop trying to cause them and I don’t know what to do. Ever since my first hypomanic episode I’ve done everything to cause it again, I purposely got on just antidepressants, that caused it, and then I got intense cravings for said antidepressant when it ended in only a day. Is it possible to genuinely get addicted to euphoric mania? I feel like I am helpless. When I get the shot I won’t be able to stop taking my meds to cause an episode so maybe that will help but I still have to wait almost 2 weeks. Before being diagnosed I never had a problem with drugs and I rarely ever did them, now I’ll do any drug if I think it might cause mania.

A friend who’s training to be a child life specialist recommended I use beads to mark my treatment which admittedly has helped a little. But I’m struggling to feel positive about the amount of time I’m spending in clinics and hospitals lately.

Here I sit 5 months later in total isolation almost and since I collect disability due to having bipolar I am alone all day. The isolation was amazing at first bc I was living in a homeless shelter with 7 other women for the last year so idk if it was even a manic episode or an eventual crash out from having my boundaries stepped on and being in all the drama of shelter life. It was INSANE at times and your living situation absolutely can affect your moods and did mine. So, it's safe to say that when I moved out and on my own with my dogs and parents it was heaven. I immediately removed myself from some dramatic relationships and the chaos by removing myself entirely eventually. I think everyone needs someone to talk to and that's where I'm at.

2025-10-29 07:17:51;Short Term Disability leave for Bipolar Disorder? Qualifications?;"I am thinking about pursuing short term disability leave for a mental health crisis and am curious if anybody else has successfully done so. 

My already fragile mental health has been SPIRALING as of late and  it's work-related, but in the sense that I am in a relatively new position and have been suffering with completely self-induced anxiety about it for two years. I want to emphasize that I don't really hate the job itself. I am well compensated, I like the company I work for and the people I work with, and the overall culture around work/life balance is very good. I am just really struggling with intense imposter syndrome and obsessive worrying about my own progress and competency and what my managers and team think of me. The anxiety has gotten so bad that I genuinely feel that it is starting to prevent me from doing my job well or even at all, which just contributes to the anxiety even more. I can't eat, I haven't been sleeping well, I'm starting to feel so out-of-body and I feel so depressed about being miserable all time. My sex life is non-existent and my husband has been so supportive and understanding, but I'm worried it will eventually start to effect my marriage. When it comes to working I become totally paralyzed and I've been putting things off and ignoring tasks and it's starting to come back to bite me in the ass. I have plenty of PTO I can utilize but even when I take time off I can't seem to rest/recharge because I'm obsessively thinking about all of the things that I need to get done, and the anxieties I will have to navigate through in order to complete them once I'm back at my desk.

I feel like getting some extended time off to step away from major stressors and prioritize taking care of myself could really help me. If I were to take disability leave I literally wouldn't be allowed to work, and when I returned to the office it would be to a clean slate. I don't want to quit. Like I said this is a good gig, and I know myself well enough to know that I would eventually fall down this spiral again at a new job too. 

That said, I'm also struggling with massive guilt because my team is short-handed at the moment and if I left then everybody would end up with my work on their plate too. 

I was diagnosed with bp2 and general anxiety disorder in early 2023, and at that time started seeing a therapist twice a month for about two years - I just recently started seeing her again. At the time of my diagnosis I also started seeing a psych and have sense started taking a mood stabilizer, wellbutrin, vyvanse, and also have xanax on an as-needed basis. 

I have excellent health insurance (by American standards) and because I have a formal diagnosis and this recent background of treatment I think that I could have a good chance of successfully filing a claim. 

Curious if anybody has done this, what the process was like, and what you did during your leave that helped you reset. Sorry for the novel.

I accepted that I was different, and that I needed help. Now I take my meds every day. It’s part of my balance.

2025-10-29 06:34:43;Learning new things about being manic;"I've been diagnosed for a year but it's funny how I can't still recognize being manic early on. It lasts for weeks before I fully notice. I had a religious psychosis recently from May to July. My meds were adjusted but just recently we had to lower the dosage of quetiapine because it makes me so sedated I can't even function.


Now, I just realized I'm manic for weeks now. My religious psychosis is back, I thought it was me being religious but this time I'm being reasonable but no it's just me being a psycho again. I never thought this was a symptom before because I thought it was just a personality but damn the self confidence I have is crazy lol. I become obsessed with make-up, skincare, and body care. Which is not normal for me because all I care about is the basics of skincare. Now I splurged on make-ups and skincare products which I don't really use and won't probably use in the future. My friends told me I was so loud and so hyper these past few weeks but I thought it was just me being healed and happy lol. I stare at the mirror and just appreciate how pretty I am lol but  when I'm normal I'm insecure.


It's just crazy how even with meds and therapy, I still can't recognize manic symptoms before it turns to full mania. Well now, it's full mania cause I only got 2-3 hours sleep recently. I hope I'll learn more about myself as I live with this disorder. Maybe it's something I should tell my therapist because the techniques she suggested didn't work this time lol.";r/bipolar;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oinpn0/learning_new_things_about_being_manic/
2025-10-29 05:37:02;Coping with intensive treatment?;I’m a college student with bipolar 2 and have been diagnosed for years but have struggled to respond to most medications. For the last two years I was in essentially remission and was able to manage my symptoms without medication and with just lifestyle changes and finally had my life on track. However this past summer I entered one of the worst depressive episodes of my life which caused a lot of physical health issues. I’ve been put in TMS therapy but am struggling with the isolation caused by medical treatment. Five days a week I leave campus to go sit in a clinic in a dark room alone, twitchy and in pain. I don’t want to have a bad attitude as I’m worried it will decrease treatment efficacy. A friend who’s training to be a child life specialist recommended I use beads to mark my treatment which admittedly has helped a little. But I’m struggling to feel positive about the amount of time I’m spending in clinics and hospitals lately. I have seven weeks left and will take any advice to make the intensity of going through treatment while also trying to be a normal person more bareable. Bipolar is such a horrible disease.

2025-10-29 05:28:44;Dual diagnosis/ late diagnosis;"Long story short. I (F35) was “diagnosed” with bipolar II in early 2024 by my therapist. I say “diagnosed” because it wasn’t official, obviously. no psych eval, just her opinion. When I told my psychiatrist, he prescribed mood stabilizers on top of my anti-anxiety and antidepressant meds. 

Before this, the last time I saw a mental health professional was in high school. I have no idea what her opinion was of me. I ghosted her after a handful of sessions (easier in 2007/2008).

The “diagnosis” came after a rough few years of spiral. 

After cycling through a ton of meds, I finally found some success with a combo. “Success” meaning I could stay awake and wasn’t eating butter straight from the fridge.

Then in Feb 2025, I decided I wasn’t bipolar anymore and quit everything cold turkey. Also ghosted my psychiatrist after working with him for a year, and therapist of two years.. which, honestly, wasn’t the best idea. 

Now I’m wondering if I actually have bipolar disorder or if it’s something else. I check some boxes, but without the proper insurance, I can’t get a formal psych eval.

Obv it’s been some months since I stopped any and all medications and … it hasn’t been great 😐

Has anyone else had a late or questionable diagnosis and later found out it was wrong or a dual diagnosis?

TL;DR: Therapist “diagnosed” me with bipolar II, psychiatrist treated it. Quit everything cold turkey in 2025 and now questioning it. ";r/bipolar2;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oim1tk/dual_diagnosis_late_diagnosis/
2025-10-29 05:12:19;He knew all this but 20 months on he left again..;"
This was a letter my ex husband wrote to himself after he came home remorseful in April 2024, was then diagnosed with Bipolar in June 2023. This was after two manic  highs which had ruined our family life. Me and my two sons devastated. (Hypersexuality, cheating, huge lies, financial lies, smear campaigns, humiliation, cruelty to me only, specifically. And more). I still wanted him back and thought, naively, we were safe, we'd got the diagnosis and medication. He promised never again. I wanted to believe it. But no, 20 months later, in Dec 2024, the trigger being his dads death, he switched again, despite the 300mg seroquel and 50mg Sertraline he was on. I think k the medication should have been adjusted to meet the move out from depression.  His letter below...

Dear A
I'm writing this letter to you in the event you start to go into yet another high. You should watch out for the very early signs. Hopefully you'll never reach this stage however if you do then re read this letter and understand where it's heading and the resulting destruction it will cause if you go down this path again, then it will destroy K, L and S so why would you want to do that when you love them? They have given you the family life which you so desperately craved and wanted you must acknowledge now that you have a serious medical condition, Bipolar, which needs to be carefully managed with the appropriate drugs. 

Despite all the awful and cruel things you have done K has agreed to take you back into the family home. Please understand how afraid she is that you are going to yet again turn back into the cruel monster of before.

S can no longer trust you as his dad, L has virtually given up on you concluding that you will always repeat the same behaviors of the last years. Please find the strength to show them that you can be the husband and father of old. 

It is going to take years for them ever to trust you again. Show them acts of kindness and love so they can see the true A, not the shell of a man that has done so many bad things to them in the last few years. 

If you do re-enact the behaviors then you are putting yourself, but more importantly your family onto a ruinous path. Remember some of the things you were doing.

My demonization of K making out to be a demon to my friends. This is incredibly cruel, callous behavior towards her for which I'm truly sorry.

Being incredibly cold to her by refusing to speak to her for long periods of time.

Cruelty is a big thing towards my wife as I see her as an obstacle to getting what I want. I will cut her off and refuse to speak to her. Far worse than this is how I will give my friends false information about her so they will give me their unquestioning support with what I want to do. 
I will actively turn these people against her which is incredibly cruel and refusing to have any communication with her is incredibly callous.

When I go into a high my ego grows enormously I start to think solely about my own needs what I want to do not even considering anyone else specifically my family. 

Although K is waiting for my next high I know this is not going to happen. I have the self-realization to understand the early warning signs of this behavior with her help, Bipolar drugs and the knowledge of the hurt and destruction these episodes can cause and I'm determined to ensure they never repeat.

Don't think just about your own selfish needs as you've done in the recent past but be kind and caring to your wife and children.

2025-10-29 02:37:33;My first time posting here after brutal discard;"Been with my SO for a little over 6 months. He is diagnosed BP1 and medicated…. When he stays on them. We’ve had 2 other situations where he’s been in an episode and he “broke up” with me, and I chose to forgive and move forward. I have truly never loved someone more than I love him. When he is good he is the man I see myself with for the rest of my life and a person who couldn’t be a better match for me. 

He’s been working out of town but coming back every weekend and communication has always been pretty good between us. I noticed about a week ago he seemed to be a bit manic and he did disclose he hadn’t been keeping up with his meds as much as he’s supposed to. (Trying to keep this as short as possible, but it’s been a week) 
I only saw him for one night last week before he went back to work, then he was back home this weekend. He had been distant and I expressed while he was gone that I noticed distance and he said everything was fine. Then he was home and still seemed so distant- like he would have rather been anywhere but hanging out with me. I tried letting it go and wasn’t pushing. We spent Saturday out with friends and they noticed he was being weird too. Fast forward to coming home that night, he completely lost his shit on me. Attacked literalllllly everything about me— used my past abusive relationship against me, insulted my job, my house, my motherhood (I’m a single mom with kids from said abusive past relationship), insulted my body, just absolutely every mean thing he could say to hurt me. He has NEVER before insulted me even when in an episode, so this was new for me.
He left, and I’m in shambles. We spoke very briefly yesterday morning via text and he was still just being rude. Haven’t spoken since. I know that I can’t tolerate that behavior and that even if I do hear from him (he’s typically very good at apologies and in the last 2 crash outs he’s had, came back very apologetic and took actions to make things better), I can’t let him back in. I’m beyond heartbroken. I feel like I just lost my best friend and the thought of possibly never even seeing him again makes me sick. I’ve never experienced a breakup with someone who I loved so deeply and was so caught off guard by. I really thought we could get through things but with the insults and name calling, that was the last straw.

2025-10-29 01:45:21;New symptom?? Has anyone had this?;"I'm not a reddit user typically but this is prob the best place to ask. Recently I've had an issue where I experience extreme onset fatigue/tiredness and have been falling asleep in the early evening, even while just laying or sitting down, sometimes I just pass out without warning (All of this has only occurred while in resting positions, not standing/moving). I've never had this symptom before and I'm not even sure it's a bipolar thing, since I believe I'm not in an episode currently, and my episodes are typically mostly highs and not lows.

For reference: I am BP1 and have been diagnosed a 2 years ago but its affected me for about 6\~ years. Medication has been 400mg Lamictal, 150mg bupropion, 0.2mg clonidine, and 10mg Adderall XR but not daily. Bupropion is to restore my humanity because of the massive Lamictal dose. All of these meds I've taken at this amount for 6\~ months, so there's no new change.

I've gotten bloodwork done and no significant abnormalities, my sleep hasn't ever been terrible, and I eat well enough.

2025-10-29 01:32:09;Discarded and grieving;"   

   I 29 (m) met the most wonderful person 24(m) this summer. He was the most funny, smart, fun, affectionate, talented, cultured, unabashedly unique, and handsome man I ever met. I met him on a dating app within literal minutes of making a low effort profile. Planned on deleting it shortly after making it. I just wanted to kill time one day and see the scene after over a year of being single after getting out a long term relationship. I've done the dating app song and dance before, and it's usually an annoying process. Well this guy was different, and immediately became my only reason for keeping the dating app just to talk to him.             


   I messaged him first and immediately conversation was consistent, funny, and interesting like I have never experienced so quickly in my life. He travels for a living and is only in my state semi regularly for a week or so at a time to see family. We were unable to meet initially due to life and my work schedule and he left for about a month but we stayed in close touch the entire time. Daily messaging and transferring our communication off the dating app and to snapchat. I can not stress enough how lovely this talking was, and so I could not wait for him to come back so we could finally meet face to face. 


    Well he came back and we met with him driving from his family's home near the largest city in my state to my tiny country town apartment about an hour away. Immediately it was amazing. He was all the great things I've said about him earlier magnified 5 times over and we both felt an instant strong spark filled connection. I felt magnetized to this absolute gem of a person like I have never felt in my life, and he very much reciprocated my feelings. What followed was the most fun dates of my life with the most affectionate and fascinating person I've ever met. 


    He left for a week or so again, and came back with us staying in constant flirtatious touch. This time he invited me to his family's home. He quickly introduced me to his family, friends, and continued to show me nothing but love, affection, and fun times for nearly that entire week. Kissing me on the lips upon greeting and holding my hand in public, something as a gay man in a conservative rural state I have never experienced. Time with him felt like a beautiful cheesey romance movie. We became official near the end of this visit after he revealed he had deleted all his dating apps and just wanted me. I was jubilant. 


    During that time mental health had came up. I have suffered with bouts of depression and anxiety in my life and at one time was on Lexapro. He revealed he had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety before and used to have a therapist and was prescribed the same at one point. Some very tragic and unexpected losses have happened in his family so I figured that likely triggered his depression, as to me then he came across as the most happy and confident outgoing man with such enthusiasm for life and exploring i've ever met. He revealed he ended up stopping seeing his therapist suddenly and that Lexapro made him feel hypersexual. He also revealed he thinks he has seasonal depression with his moods shifting in the fall and winter. At the time I found that simply odd, as it's well known that one of the most common side effects of most antidepressants is a hit to sex drive, and I've never heard of the reverse. Now I see that it was likely a symptom of mistreated bipolar disorder. 


     Regardless he had to leave again, this time for 2.5 months. I have never been in a long distance relationship but for him it felt more than worth it. Besides, he had told me he had plans of quitting his job very soon, likely right after he got back and likely moving full time to my state. We stayed in close touch for the first 1.5 months with the usual enthusiastic, funny, and consistent messaging. The miss yous and can't wait to see you agains and he even made plans with me to go see some of his family members in another state together when he got back. He told me i was good for his mental health. Then practically over night it all changed.


    His messages suddenly shifted to short often dry and far fewer and with often large gaps in time sometimes well over 24 hours and remained that way for the rest of our short relationship. His affectionate words to me all but completely disappeared. But when i brought up the change he did apologize and say hes noticed it too and its all him. I do not need constant communication by any means in a relationship, but this sudden shift was jarring to say the least. It was like all his boundless enthusiasm was completely sucked out of him. He did start very casually mentioning feeling down and sleeping alot more and weight changes in our convos so I figured he was going through depression. I thought maybe with all the stresses of life with wanting to change jobs and revealing to me his plans of also wanting to go back to college he was just getting overwhelmed. So i tried to not take it personally and to just be there for him when he wanted to talk but it was certainly anxiety inducing. 


    We had a phone call the week before he was going to be back where we found a day we could meet. He revealed that he was gonna be very busy that week with alot of online training for his job and a wedding he had to go to for a family member but that he will make time for me. He also had revealed that he may be keeping his job and actually moving across the country for it if he gets this new opportunity but he's unsure if it'll happen. Disappointing news for me of course, but of course I'd be happy for him if he were to get it. Just seemed so sudden when he seemed so confident about quitting just weeks prior still. 


     Well when he got back this early October he remained distant. When he used to return it was like we couldn't keep away from each other, but now he even came back slightly early by a day or two and didn't tell me that was gonna happen with no change to his plans of wanting to see me. Late at night before the day we were supposed to see each other he hadn't even brought up anything about it. I brought it up asked if he was still down and he said yes and that he will come to my place instead of me to his familys. I asked when he will come and he Said just depends when he wakes up. I accepted that vague response and resent him my address and he hearted my message 


     Well the next day he never came. I waited alone for him and after several texts and a unanswered phone call he finally responded with a simple ""I'm alive"" almost 24 hours after he had last messaged me agreeing to come see me. I didn't get another response from him until 12 hours later where he told me he's being an asshole and I don't deserve this and he will let me know what's going on when he figures it out. I message back with concern for him but also clearly hurt and confused and he simply tells me he can't maintain this relationship right now. 


     Well I invite friends over due to not wanting to be alone and get big sad man drunk. At 5 am he calls me and I'm still up and very intoxicated. He is bawling and reveals that there have been some horrible things happening in his life and that he feels far too unstable to be in a relationship. He reveals that he thinks hes never been stable enough to be in a relationship and apologizes to me that I even met him despite saying we had great chemistry. He says he keeps thinking he's ready for one but he never is, and that he was hoping me and him could just have fun and party forever but he cant. I drunkenly basically beg him not to break up with me which I should not have done as I think it only further stressed him but I was very much in my feels and intoxicated. On this phone call he reveals he likely is bipolar as his therapist thought he was and wanted him to get professionally diagnosed but he never did. He also reveals he can recreationally take Lexapro to start a Lil mania to have some fun.


     Well the phone call ends essentially in him hanging up on me. I send him a message the next day essentially telling him I'm so so sorry for how he feels and all the horrible events he's been experiencing and that he doesn't deserve this pain. I also tell him I won't message him again unless he messages me cause I don't want to further cause him any more stress or pain but that I still care about him and have concern. He was so deeply distraught on that phone call it was impossible not to feel so much empathy for him especially when he was a guy I still feel so so strongly for. 


    As expected he has not responded, which is not surprising considering the intense depressive mind set he was/maybe still is in. It's been well over a week now  He may never message me again and I guess I just have to accept that. He might even be moving accross the country anyway. But I have just been so emotionally impacted. I have never felt so strongly about a person so quickly in my life, and have the feeling so strongly reciprocated until it just suddenly wasnt is a different type of pain. I knew he was suffering but I didn't know how bad. And bipolar or not the things he told me would throw anyone into a depressive episode. I just wanted to be there for him to hold him and I couldn't and I was discarded. I can't even be mad at him. If he feels too unstable I understand maybe in a way thats him trying to protect me. But i miss him so much and am feeling a grief over this relationship unlike any I've ever felt before.


       I just wish I knew what he was going through before a sudden discard. I wish I could of done things differently. I wish i wasnt drunk when he suddenly called me. I hope that he finds stability some day. If he truly is bipolar I see him as so much more than a diagnosis. He's such an amazingly intelligent and great person from what I experienced and he deserves the world. I just wish I could be in that world with him. What do you all think?

I was diagnosed 8 years but it hasn’t been until recently that this type of specific cycle has emerged. Before when I wasn’t doing well it would be like 2 months good and then a couple days. 

What’s worked for you all? Do you notice certain emotions or reactions prevailed?";r/bipolar2;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oif8qk/timed_mood_cycles/
2025-10-29 00:46:32;i was diagnosed, and i have some thoughts;"hello hello,

i don’t really know why im writing this, but i guess i have so many thoughts in my head and dont know where to turn to.

lifelong mental health sufferer here, periods of being proactive and trying to figure out ‘what’s wrong with me?’ to periods of just suffering and accepting it 

i am 28, throughout my life have had various diagnoses (aspergers, bpd). after a particularly bad break up (ghost/diacard) by another bipolar person, i went to a private pricey psychiatrist just to figure it out once and for all. i thought my whole life i was just severely, incurably depressed with spells of having my shit together. she was so kind to me, and told me that i have bipolar 2 and aspects of BPD as well.

i have experienced a ton of trauma throughout my childhood and 20’s so she ruled out CPTSD first. i’m hyper self aware of myself, my triggers and how i feel but i could never fix it. 

so i guess here i am, im reading through all your posts, i have the feeling of ‘i am fucked and i’m stuck like this forever’, maybe living in the unknown before was slightly easier because i didn’t know this was going to be a lifelong battle.

i’m writing here mostly because i feel alone, and alone in my thoughts. i don’t know what to do and where to go from here, i want to get better for my young daughter - it’s just me and her

im in the uk and went private for psychiatry, but will need to use public healthcare now. i’m unsure whether to be admitted to hospital or not, because i feel so stuck and i can’t get out of bed or out of my own head. i’m playing my switch as a coping mechanism. she prescribed me with some anti psychotics, ive been on a ton of SSRI’s my whole life and they never worked so i don’t think it’s as simple as taking a magic pill and it going away. CBT has never worked for me, and i cannot do group therapy i find it too embarrassing 

i’m worried if i do decide to go into a psychiatric unit that it’ll make me feel worse. i went to a ‘day hospital’ full time after a attempt about 10 years ago and the whole thing was ridiculous. being in contact with severely mentally ill people that were freaking out and had little mental intelligence was even more depressing and just sent me into hypomania

thank you in advance for your kind words, i am grieving my whole life 

i am not angry or violent or anything, never have been, i just feel the world too deeply and am highly sensitive ";r/bipolar2;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oiekex/i_was_diagnosed_and_i_have_some_thoughts/
2025-10-29 00:43:47;Recommendations?;"Hey everyone, so to start, I met this woman when I was in college at 19 and she was 17 as a freshman in college. Everything started quick but went very well for the first year or so, a little after I proposed to her. Fast forward a little to when we moved to FL. Small things started to hurt her and eventually got to the point of me asking the same question 3 times caused her to drop everything and wanna leave me. At this point in time she gets back with me loving me so much, even attempted to have kids for a couple months and we're about to put a down-payment on a new townhouse after buying a new car. We were great. Then one day her friend made me mad and I yelled shut up to her (both in the car) I whipped the car into the parking lot we were going to pretty hard. Week later I come home and all her stuff is gone with a note saying how she tried to fight and make me better. This whole time making me think I was wrong for the smallest things that dont normally trigger people especially to this extent. She moved back north with family. Here is where things got really bad. 

She was diagnosed at 14 with bipolar but her parents dont believe in mental illness and never got her help. At this point in time she starts experiencing ""no emotions"" ""emotional numbness"" and keeps saying she's never felt love or anything for me. She's said this a little before but usually she loves me again after a couple hours. Months go by and she starts to ""love"" me again. Things are going great, she occasionally has the ""I dont think I want you"" but usually calls hours later, day at most. 

However, this time things are going just fine, I've been flying up to see her and everything is perfect with each other, no fighting or anything. She was all over me. Then one day, I said ""wow, you got home from work and didnt text me? Do you even love me"" kinda as a joke. Well this has led to all these sayings again ""I always forced my love for you"" ""I was attached and didnt like change"" ""I never actually wanted you"" stuff. Again, normally when this happens it lasts less than a day. We're on day 8 of basically no contact. She claims she's enjoyed time with her family and working on hw (finishing her teaching exams). 

I just want some advice please... is this typical non-medicated bipolar? Is this just an episode that's probably lasting longer than usual, after all she's only 21 now. She was recently diagnosed with PCOS and has an avoidant attachment style. She's told me to move on many times, one time I tried and she instantly regretted it and wanted me back. Should I try to move on? I'm willing to fight harder than most people as I understand if its just  a mental thing she cant necessarily help what she feels without treatment. 

Again, I mainly just want opinions... I wanna know if this is something I can expect to just blow over or does she really not care? Cause when she's ""normal"" everything is so amazing and she's such a loving person who does everything for me. 

Sorry for the long post, thank you everyone";r/BipolarSOs;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oiehqc/recommendations/
2025-10-29 00:25:17;Has anyone felt like this?;Hey, i’m newly diagnosed with Bipolar type two, after experiencing deep and long depressions and a supposed hypomanic episode that lead to paranoia and delusion, but not that serious, my mam gave me a reset and my anti psychotic and i got knackered, calming the episode . I’m having quite a hard time accepting i have it, and I started doubting it because my therapist also encouraged me to seek for a second option just in case. I’m starting to doubt if I’m bipolar and thinking i probably made it all in my head, even if i the feeling in the episodes felt real.  Has anyone felt like this too? thinking you made it all in your head?

2025-10-29 00:21:19;Misdiagnosed?;"My therapist of at least three years just casually dropped on me that she wonders if I am potentially misdiagnosed. She didn’t say what she thought an accurate diagnosis would be and we kind of moved on quickly. It’s been almost a week and it’s fucking with me. I keep thinking about it. This diagnosis is something I’ve accepted as part of who I am. It doesn’t feel good to have her question that. 

Has anyone else been in a similar boat?

(For more context: we were talking about how even at my worst moments, I feel conscious of my kids seeing me and I generally feel pretty in control of myself - though there have absolutely been moments where that has lapsed. She’s mentioned in the past she feels that many people who are diagnosed with BP2 are actually just highly empathetic.)";r/bipolar2;4;11;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oidvmo/misdiagnosed/
2025-10-29 00:04:10;Divorce;"Long post and really need to vent and someone I can talk to. 

Well I’ve reached the end of being married.

38m and wife 45f. 3 years ago I diagnosed with BP1.  Things have been difficult but I’m still here. 

Here’s the thing about my wife. She’s been called a narcissist by people who know her and I’ve always endured because I truly love her. Things she would say about me and to me,

•Sex- “You’re so lucky, other husbands don’t even get sexy time”. (I have to beg every Sunday after cooking, cleaning and laundry). Too many to list down but yeah it’s just dreadful while she lays down like a dead fish but sex is sex right?
•Family- “Don’t disturb my family” “Go back to your mom”, well, my family disowned me for many reasons, religion, my sickness etc.. so I’m actually closer to her family although they’re not in the same country but we talk a lot and she hates it. 
Kids- “They’re your kids too”, especially when cleaning them up, she refuses to help clean their butts after they pooped. 
“I want to be treated like a princess” but at the same time, “I want a simple life”
“You need to change” “You need to take care of yourself because no one will do it for you” all these while I needed support after mania. 

Just way too much for me to keep typing here..

We’ve just had an argument about how I need to settle my debts. Our net worth right now is $600k but I still have debts of 31k(started at 100k 5 years ago) which I’ve been paying myself. But I’ve lost my job 3 months ago and bankruptcy has been filed as I stopped paying. 

I told her 3 years ago while things were good and that we should sell our place to make some money and move to a new one. We could pay off my debts in full and we can actually move to a bigger house while maintaining the same mortgage(A little out of our location but lower prices). I even engaged a property agent to explain to her why we should do it. But she ignored every single word and today she said I didn’t explain it to her about it. 

So today I called her mom so we can all talk together and discuss what our plans are, 

• She wants me to change(Take my meds, go back to work etc) I agreed.
• I want her to change and treat me with respect and love which she refused and said you’re not the same person I married. 

It ended in a shouting match. 

There’s too many things on my mind to list out down here.. but I really need help and someone to talk to right now. I’ve been off my meds for more than a month, I haven’t slept in 2 days and feel really overwhelmed. 

I told her since we can’t agree, we should just separate. I own 70% but I’m willing to split with her 50/50 but again she’s not happy either because she doesn’t want to take care of the kids herself.

I just want to put this out there because someone always says it: I dont qualify for medicaid or anything because im still claimed on my parents taxes, and they make over $250,000. they dont believe my diagnosis and refuse to have anything to do with the care.

I am in college now. I went to an early college and this is my first year out of it. I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and now its 3.2. Ive barely gone to any classes because of depressive episodes. My parents make fun of my diagnosis etc. I have barely turned in any homework, and im scared about what will happen to me when my grades drop.

Before starting this year I did talk to my parents about taking a gap year or not going to college at all because what i want to do isnt something you need a degree for. but my parents are really traditional so they want me to go.

I want to so badly to drop out, but im scared of being kicked out etc. I cant help but feeling like im overreacting, but i literally have to use my scholarship money for medical care in secret. which my mom will find out eventually";r/BipolarReddit;6;10;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oid00z/am_i_about_to_ruin_my_life/

2025-10-28 22:03:51;Quetiapine, alcohol, and surviving holidays;"Basically what it says. My relationship with my inlaws is hit or miss and I usually have a drink or two to survive the encounter. Not ideal, but it is what it is. 

I am about the start meds for the first time tonight, and with the holiday season upon us I need to make sure I have the resources in place to survive spending time with them. I have cut them out of my life before when things got really bad (they said they would blame me if my husband died of a heart attack due to stress because we lived downtown in small city!) but want to avoid that if I can as they are getting quite old and have actually been very generous to us when things are going well (ex. They gave us a down payment for the house, so we could move away from the aforementioned downtown. My husband, btw, hates commuting and wishes he still could walk to work).

I am also scared about their reaction to my new BP2 diagnosis, which I am sure will come up. Either they will deny it or will weaponize it against me. I am 46 and only now allowing myself to get help after years of stigma keeping me from getting the treatment I have desperately needed for years, and I definitely don't need this extra stress. 

I am grateful that my own family is so supportive. I was adopted, and my adoptive family is emotionally stable and amazing. A reminder that you marry a whole family, not just an individual. 

Thoughts on what I can do to make it through the inlaws? Thanks in advance. ";r/bipolar2;5;15;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oia8yd/quetiapine_alcohol_and_surviving_holidays/
2025-10-28 22:00:43;Jobs;"Hello! I just joined but I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder since I was 18, I am now 26. I’ve been on and off my meds for years, sometimes going months on them and weeks off or vice versa. Personally, it has caused my life to be a living hell. I’ve done a lot of things out of mania and anger. Things I don’t want to repeat or bring up. It took me an extra year to graduate college. 

I didn’t get a job immediately out of college. I was unemployed for a bit and then job hopped in this economy. Then I was kicked out of a house (not fully unnecessary) and had to move in with my parents. Eventually they helped me grab an apartment and I got a retail job only to “quit” (they wrote me up and I refused to sign it.) Hopped over to a vape store and ran into many intense people with my intense personality (bad bad idea.) Tried an insurance job (boo.) Then I finally got a job at a Hemp Store. 

It went well but I had many ups and downs but they were super willing to help and even gave me books. That was until a customer pulled into the parking lot hit their door with mine and denied it. I asked nicely initially but they had an attitude and lied. I proceeded to get out and look and I say something that I couldn’t stop, “Bitch, you hit my car.” (I know I shouldn’t have but I was upset and unfiltered at the time.) I decide to reach for my phone to call the cops and that’s when they hit it out my hand and jump me. 

As in they attacked me. I have little to no recollection of what happened after one hit me down on the ground, all I know is the security guards sat and watched. When they were done with it, they tried to steal my wallet and successfully stole my phone. Threw the phone out the window and it was ran over. My nose was bleeding, I had scratches, bruises, and a swollen lip. 

The owners wouldn’t release the video footage to me and the cops said I couldn’t have it so I don’t know what exactly happened. There was also a rumor that the security guards threatened someone with a gun when they went to intervene. Anyways, I got fired after asking for unemployment which I couldn’t receive anyways since I wasn’t on clock. 

It’s been two months since that happened and I’m still unable to get another job. I’ve had two interviews and neither worked out. I want to use my degree but that’s difficult. However, I’m having mixed feelings as I’m published 2x over again and streaming may be my new thing. Since I actually have a few followers and have invested some into it. In short, I’m not sure how to cope with the difficulties of monitoring emotion and filters to hold a job down. (Sometimes it causes issues in relationships too.) Anyone else experience the extreme of it all? 

TLDR: Jobs are difficult to hold down with the disorder and I’ve struggled constantly. I haven’t had a job in months, I got published again, and my stream is getting noticed; mixed feelings all around. How do you all cope with jobs and navigating that with the disorder and the extremes of it all? ";r/BipolarReddit;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oia601/jobs/
2025-10-28 21:59:59;I destroyed my relationship and I never want to do it to someone else;"Hi guys, this is going to be a long and hard one for me. 

I almost 18M recently got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in July this year. I had been in a relationship with the woman who meant the world to me for about a year and a half. I had experienced mostly extreme depressive episodes during our time together. She was incredible and supportive for the most part, calling me in hospital and making sure she stuck by me. However while i knew at at the time, I look back now and notice how destructive my depressive episodes were for her and our relationship. I literally put that woman through hell and back and I wish I could have been the person she needed me to be. 

In June this year I had my first majorly destructive hypomanic episode which consequently left to my offical diagnosis. This was her tipping point. She had decided that she couldn’t do it anymore, which I didn’t and still do not blame her one bit. 

I know this sounds incredibly arrogant and yes, I’m aware that I’m “still young” and “there are plenty of fish in the sea”. But I’m also very aware and emotionally mature, which is why I can acknowledge how destructive this disorder can be to those around me. 

I feel that i shouldn’t allow myself to have a relationship at any point in time. I believe this because I don’t think anyone should have to suffer the consequences of my disorder. It would make me incredibly selfish to put someone else in that position knowing what my disorder can do.

2025-10-28 21:39:56;Bipolar?;Hey everyone 👋 I was diagnosed with bipolar II without a formal diagnosis but rather a psychiatrist met with me once when I was really low and sobbing through the whole meeting and she told me I had bipolar II. Some of the symptoms really resonate with me but some of them not so much. I’m also autistic and I’m wondering if I was having an autistic meltdown rather than a bipolar outburst when I was meeting with the psychiatrist. Anyways I’ve now been telling doctors I have bipolar II and I’m on an antipsychotic to help with the symptoms. I find that my mood is definitely more stable but I’m just wondering if this counts as a diagnosis? Do I need to find a new psychiatrist who will go through an assessment with me, or at this point does my other doc know me well enough to say I do have bipolar II? (I met with this psych for over 6months before she made me too mad to go back…long story) I flip back and forth in thinking yes this fits and no I’m faking it. Any advice would be appreciated. ;r/BipolarReddit;3;29;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oi9n8j/bipolar/
2025-10-28 20:00:57;Distraught and can't wrap my mind around the ways bipolar is contributing;"This feels like more of a relationship/abandonment issue, but I wanted to get input from folx w bipolar because I think the disease is playing with my sense of reality. I was diagnosed about six months ago (around when this issue began, although I can't recall which happened first), not sure bipolar 1 or 2 but leaning toward 1. I am in weekly individual and group therapy and call the crisis hotline about once a week. I am on lithium, lamictal, bupropion, and gabapentin and we're still adjusting. I also have chronic illnesses that cause me pain, and I have no family besides chosen family.

I'm struggling so much, and right now it's focused on my partner of 3 years. He moved in earlier this year. Since he moved in, he's been working full time and going to school half time. I did a 10 week IOP program this summer and started a new full time job a month ago. We also both have other commitments, but I'd say his take up 3-4x as much time as mine. We're both spread thin, but there's absolutely *nothing* left for him to give. I had already been feeling like I missed him all the time before we moved in, and I hoped that if we lived together, I'd at least get more time on the edges. That's been true, but it doesn't feel like enough, especially with the strong feelings I've been having around our sex life. 

I told him six months ago, just before he moved in, that I was unhappy with the frequency of our sex. I'm not very good at those conversations and it was highly emotional and full of tears on my part. Since then, it feels like 4-6 week cycles where he'll hear me, say he's going to make a change, things improve slightly, then some stressor intensifies and things drop off until I have another meltdown and we repeat the process. I know the meltdowns are related to intense insecurity and feelings that sex = love, and less sex means less love and therefore the impending end of the relationship. I also get scared that if I voice this, I'll be too much and he'll leave, so I try to find any outlet other than putting more stress on him. I have absolutely no evidence that he will leave me, and in fact lots of evidence to the contrary, but the stakes feel so high that I then want to protect myself and withdraw not just from him but from everything, further feeding my depression and low self worth. My mind becomes this nightmare hellscape I can't escape and I'm sure that every moment I'm like this is another reason I will, in fact, eventually be too much.

I don't know what to do. I feel at this point that if he wanted to be having more sex, we'd be having more sex - so it's clearly not something he wants. Either he doesn't want to have sex with me, or he doesn't have room in his life for me - either way, my behavior is the only thing I can change. I try to just be happy and grateful for what I have and ignore my feelings of rejection so that we can at least enjoy each other in other ways, but it isn't working. I'm so sad and I'm just pulling myself in and in and in like a black hole that will eventually pop into nothing. So maybe I should just leave. He's only at the beginning of his school program - his availability isn't going to improve for 3-4 years, and I don't want to feel like this for that long. But then I'll be by myself, just as torn apart, but with absolutely no one to help me pick up the pieces. But if I stay I'll be miserable and he'll be unable to handle it and I'll be alone anyway, so why not at least have some control over it.

I'm aware that there are a million logical fallacies in what I just wrote. I *know* so many of the answers, but I can't feel them in my core. I don't know how to pull myself out of this. I had a lot of  med changes since the issue began, and the feelings keep going strong no matter what. I know he is getting frustrated with the cycle and feeling like we've had the conversation and are making progress only for the same thing to pop up again and again. I'm scared that this is just the way I am, and I have to figure out how to live with it.

So, what do you think? Is this the illness, or am I just fucked up in other delightful ways? What do I try to get my brain to just shut up already? ";r/BipolarReddit;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oi7faf/distraught_and_cant_wrap_my_mind_around_the_ways/

Unfortunately, bc of bipolar, the rebound of the stimulants affects me much harder than average, especially the depression that comes with the rebound.

2025-10-28 18:02:11;Trying to understand bipolar….(long rant/questioning diagnosis);"Hi there, sorry in advance for the long post, I’m just lost.

I was recently (last year) diagnosed with bipolar type 1. So many symptoms were present and it made sense at the time and my doctor immediately got to work with helping me find a course of action with medications and we’ve progressively gotten better and I’ve noticed so much improvement.

Flash back to three weeks ago and an extremely stressful situation happened with work and I feel like everything was undone. I got so angry, my intrusive thoughts have always been bad but they just felt so much worse especially with anger. I then lost my appetite almost and for someone that’s a bing eater it felt like such a high I just pushed myself to not eat at much as possible and lost fifteen pounds in two weeks. 

On top of this, I’m a photographer and love dark and abandoned things but always took precaution and didn’t like being out at night and trying things. I found myself driving around and seeking out dark spaces to put myself in and almost wanted them to absorb me. I wanted to feel scared. 

Simultaneously I started feeling something I hadn’t dealt with in a long time and that is hyper sexuality. It’s going on three weeks where I feel the need to almost just throw myself at anyone who wants me. It’s SO distracting all day. I can’t stop feeling aroused and it’s affecting my work. 

Over the last week I’ve gained my appetite back full throttle and I’m so upset. I loved not being hungry for those two weeks. Especially since I’m obese and I was hoping I could change.

With all this being said, I have still functioned and been able to somewhat do my job and exist. Am I even bipolar?? I read up on so many other stories where people are hospitalized in their manic episodes but I haven’t, almost last year since I wanted to end myself but I somehow was able to refuse treatment. Is this regular bipolar behavior or am I just dealing with normal things?? I’m so confused.

2025-10-28 14:23:18;Family keeps asking about pregnancy..;I’ve been married for 2 years. All anybody ever wants to ask is when we’re going to have a baby. The answer for me is never. I’m not willing to sacrifice my stability. I’m also not willing to share my diagnosis with my entire family. Few of my loved ones know and I’d like to keep it that way. I usually let it roll off my back but this weekend something really bothersome happened. I told my grandma I had something really exciting to tell her at a family event over the weekend and she immediately freaked out and asked if I was pregnant. Umm… no grandma… I enrolled in a medical program and I wanted you to be proud of me. She completely overshadowed the good news I wanted to share with this theoretical pregnancy she keeps trying to push on me. She is the most notorious for asking for a baby also, even tho I have told her privately why it is not going to happen, and I’ve been very firm in my choice every time she asks. This weekend just really got under my skin because it took away all the joy I had in sharing my new career goals with her. I called my mom after the fact and she said the way I brought it up felt like I was announcing a pregnancy. Why is that where everybody’s mind immediately goes?!? Just because I’m a woman I have to be an incubator?? I’m just tired of not feeling heard. I cried about it all weekend. ;r/bipolar;26;15;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oi23dy/family_keeps_asking_about_pregnancy/
2025-10-28 13:28:28;I'm accepting and improving;Today was my 2nd diagnosis of Bipolar II. I started my journey 2 years ago with a psychiatrist who felt like he just wanted to sign my script but not help me. Today I got help not just drugs and finally I think am in a place to accept that help. So this is just a reminder keep trying your worth it because happiness and stability aren't a dream just a process. To end with a quote from one of my favorite books Rhythm of War: “You told me it would get worse.” “It will,” Wit said, “but then it will get better. Then it will get worse again. Then better. This is life, and I will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine. But there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. That is truth. I promise you, Kaladin: You will be warm again.”;r/bipolar2;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oi197u/im_accepting_and_improving/

2025-10-28 11:55:43;Struggles with relationships;"I was told by multiple partners to go to therapy. They weren’t saying it in a derogatory way and it just took me until my current relationship to realize that. I’m not aggressive when I’m in my negative moments, but like everyone around me would describe, “it’s like you carry a cloud that fills the room when you’re mad.” I always thought it was just them not being empathetic to my emotions. I noticed people distancing themselves around me when I was in my negative states. So I would try to force myself to be positive and it would just make my frustration worst. It always makes me mad and confused because I felt like when I was in my happy states everyone would eat that shit up and would drain me then leave me when I dropped off. But I realized it’s not their fault… I’m hard to be around. And it’s really hard to accept that. 

When I’m in my more positive states or I guess “manic state” I’m adventurous, I laugh a lot, I bring people up around me. With my partners I push past the negative walls that the world brings and I take them out of their comfort zone to explore. And then out of no where it feels like the mask drops. Every little thing my partner does I get mad at. I take everything they say personally and read too deep into it. This is especially apparent when I move in with them and I can’t simply distance myself when I know I’m in this kind of headspace. With my partner now it’s even harder because he comes with kids and It brings a lot of the stress and jealousy of the BM. 

It makes me feel like I’m fake when I’m with a partner because it makes the bipolar swings much more intense and I’ve always thought that it was just because my partners never understood me. I feel fake because when they know me before I move in with them all they see is my mania showing what I consider the best part of me. They see a happy person that has a lust for life. Then when there’s no walls to hide behind anymore, they see an angry person. They see a person who gets mad at the way they hold a fork, they see a person who scratches at their face and starts crying in the middle of a grocery store because there’s too many people. They see a person who slams doors and cabinets just because they unknowingly did something or said something that I didn’t want them to. I tell them I’m just “trying to communicate” when I nit pick everything about them. 

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar before but I’ve always brushed it off as an overused diagnosis so have never tried medication. This is my first night starting medication… hopefully I finally found the answer to why I can’t seem to connect to my own thoughts and emotions.

2025-10-28 10:49:27;My doctor implied I don’t have bipolar;"I had a great doctor when I first moved here. He’s the one who recognized that I have bpd as well as bipolar—knowing that, I was able to effectively treat both and I’ve been mostly stable since the end of 2023. Unfortunately he moved on to his final year of residency and couldn’t keep me so I got a new doctor. We worked together fine. Then she went to her final year and I got another doctor. Who is the worst.

He’s one of those people you can tell thinks they’re smarter than everyone. A few weeks ago I told him I was really concerned because I’ve started to have a lot of trouble sleeping. A few months ago, we added another antidepressant for postpartum depression. To offset it, we increased the dosage of my mood stabilizer. What I suspect happened is that the ppd has resolved and I need to go off the extra antidepressants. So, going into hypomania was definitely a huge concern.

I get into my appointment and he’s like oh well so many things could be causing sleep issues. And I’m like my brain is racing and I can’t shut it up even more than usual. Oh that could be so many things.

Then he asked me what I thought about going off my mood stabilizer and what it even did for me and I was like…it stabilizes my moods?? It gave me my life back. He said that I didn’t have a history of hospitalizations for mania, just depression, so I didn’t need it. And I’m like what the fuck.

I’ve been showing symptoms of bipolar since I was 15/16. It was initially diagnosed as pmdd, then depression a decade later, and another 5 years until I got the bipolar diagnosis. By that time I’d trashed my marriage and was self medicating with alcohol and weed. Which just made things worse. No one else in my life doubts my bipolar diagnosis. When I’m feeling good, my therapist reminds me that I definitely have both bpd and bipolar and I need to stay on my meds because they’re the reason I’m feeling better.

I’m pretty sure this doctor saw the bpd diagnosis and completely dismissed me. And while I was entering hypomania too. Guys—I bought my 6 month old a $160 wool sailor suit. I have spent thousands in the last few weeks. I can’t stop. I know I need to but I just can’t do it.

Anyways this doctor pissed me off so I decided to look up my first doctor who by now has graduated residency. Lo and behold, he stayed in my city and set up his practice. When I told him who the shitty doctor was, he was like yeahhh I can see that from him. He’s working with me to adjust my meds and was immediately concerned about my sleep. I’m really thankful for him. I established care with him and dumped the other doctor.

Mostly I wanted to rant. Part of me feels like I should tell Dr shitty at his job’s supervisor what he did.

I’m participating in a study on the use of certain meds during pregnancy and had my final meeting today—one of them told me that every single woman in the study has a terrible psych story.

I was at work when I got the call. My boss asked me if I was okay. We're a pretty open and close knit workplace, and they knew I was getting testing done, so I told them I got a positive diagnosis for ADHD and ASD. They are very open about their own ADHD and many others at work share their ASD / ADHD diagnoses too. While trying to support me they shared that they were worried about me for being tested for something that could effect my career choice/ prevent me from pursuing it and specifically said ""something like Schizophrenia or Bipolar 1"". 

They were trying to be supportive and kind and offer advice and encouragement but I can't stop thinking about that and if they are right, if my carrer choice is going to be impossible to succeed in because of my diagnosis.

2025-10-28 07:59:47;Husband’s first ever manic episode and hospitalization;"New account for privacy reasons. 

My husband (45) had an acute manic episode resulting in an ambulance ride to the ER, involuntary admission w/ 96hr hold plus the weekend. 

He was not previously diagnosed as bipolar, so the working diagnosis is bipolar with mania/psychosis but there’s a good chance this may have been medication/substance induced. He was on a stimulant for adhd for 2 years, an SSRI for 5+ years, and a heavy marijuana user in college, and now for about the last 5 or so years. 

He came home today and it’s obvious to me at least that he is still not himself. Much improved from the state he was in that got him admitted but clearly still in a euphoric, “this has changed my life!”, I’ve never felt so good stage. 

But he doesn’t know it. And he didn’t know his working diagnosis until a few minutes ago, blaming his hospitalization on depression, anxiety, “a nervous breakdown”. 

I’m having such a hard time because I need him to take it easy and not go spending all our money or giving away all our stuff, or starting random businesses with “friends” he made in the hospital. But because he feels great, he’s now focused on me. Saying I need to see a therapist and psychiatrist because there’s obviously something wrong with me. While a therapist would help, I am focused on him right now and helping him get into a routine and continue to recover. 

He has all these big plans and I’m trying to be positive without encouraging them, but it’s so hard. All he wants to do is talk, nonstop, about his ideas, our future, what he wants to do. He’s gotten mad at me and stormed out once because I said the wrong thing. He doesn’t believe he has any more healing to do. 

I’m exhausted and feeling hopeless. I was ready stressed out, burned out before this, and now we’ve turned it up to 1000. Somehow I’ve still got to work like my life hasn’t completely imploded. Be strong for the kids. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for, but I’m glad I found this place. ";r/BipolarSOs;10;14;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ohus6b/husbands_first_ever_manic_episode_and/
2025-10-28 07:57:15;Do people experience a long lag time before their depression functional deficits resolve, like people have to spend months waiting out the manic stuff when they recover?;"I’m really curious about this question. 

My concern is that I’m going back and forth on whether to consider an ADHD diagnosis. I had a crippling depressive episode that’s persisted intermittently since January 2024. 

This caused severe cognitive impairments. Doctor and I used Wellbutrin and methylphenidate to try to control this.

And it mostly works! But I feel that, even though the affective symptoms of depression subsided pretty quickly, I still feel like my cognitive function is getting better. But it’s very incremental. Like the depression feels as if it’s over, but the deficits are trailing off and trailing slower than the resolution of other symptoms. 

So I’m curious about whether anyone relates. Obviously hypo/mania leads to a pretty long recovery period to reach “perfect” recovery.

I didn't shower because i was too scared to be alone without my back to the wall, and I called up an old ex to tell her to call off the 'man who she told to stand outside my window', and other crazy shit.

2025-10-28 06:54:27;Starting to think I was diagnosed wrong. What meds even work?;"I was diagnosed with BP1 by a telehealth psychiatrist in July and started an antipsychotic. It virtually stopped my panic, paranoia, insane spending and hypersexual behaviors, but after a while, it became evident that my moods were still like being strapped into a rollercoaster, and I was so tired. Like the volume on my nervous system was turned down from 11 to 1. I would go from feeling like god to feeling like worthless trash within hours, all while half asleep, back and forth all day. So, they added a mood stabilizer to the mix. 

First was trileptal- it helped my moods so much I thought, but I stopped sleeping, spent every penny I made the month I was on it, and was so impulsive and adrenaline driven that I would literally get so excited I would throw up. Then there was the shakes, nausea and dizziness from the sodium depletion… I asked to be taken off of it. 

Two weeks ago, I started on lamictal instead. I got so anxious, I thought my mother was trying to poison me. I dumped out water she gave me because I thought it had been tampered with. I ended up at the crisis unit where they gave me an Ativan and told me it was the med switch. Two weeks later, im still unbearably anxious. I actually skipped the lamictal last night- I finally slept well, but im already feeling the depressive effects of my AP coming back. 

My psych says the next step is lithium, but I don’t want to be on a medication where I need constant blood work. I can’t have taken the only two other medications available for bipolar already. That just doesn’t make sense. If all of these mood stabilizers feel so horrible, do I even have bipolar? Have I been misdiagnosed? 

I am so tired of feeling like a guinea pig with all these drugs. I just want to get thru a day without feeling like I have no control over myself, my emotions, my mind. I’m absolutely exhausted. 

For reference, the AP im on is Geodon. It seems to interact negatively with so many other medications, but it works so well for me keeping hallucinations, delusions and paranoia at bay that I don’t want to change it out. I’ve been on abilify before and it kept me up all night peeing 1000000 times. I hated it! 

I was hesitant to get back on meds in the first place, and now I remember why. This is just so difficult and stressful. And im working while going thru all these med changes and stress, im basically a shell of the person i was before i started being medicated. I don’t know what to do anymore. Im exhausted and so stressed out. Im driving my friends and boyfriend insane listening to me complain all the time. I don’t have anyone in my life with similar mental health issues. I don’t know if any of these meds are even making me any better anymore. I certainly don’t feel better. I want to get off everything and start at square 0 with a completely new doctor because I just don’t trust this one from all the med changes.

I made the time and space (with my husband’s help) to do a craft I hadn’t done in a while to disrupt my spiral, so I painted this today.

I've heard that things just become harder once you graduate and become a doctor due to all the stress and responsibility you get.

2025-10-28 06:33:26;Struggling with Bipolar II Diagnosis;I really need some other people’s voices on this: I got diagnosed with Autism and Bipolar II about a month ago, and while the Autism makes sense to me ( I even celebrated getting it), the Bipolar II took me by surprise. I had a hypomanic episode towards the end of working with Charlie Health (Intensive Outpatient Therapy), and that’s really the only thing I see as being distinctly due to being Bipolar. I know Bipolar Disorder I or II comes with more symptoms and ups and downs, but I’ve already been diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder on top of Autism and Bipolar II, that I’m really struggling to see where Bipolar II is affecting me in my day-to-day life. Everything I research seems to be more likely my anxiety or Autism burnout which then just makes me feel more and more confused as well as more and more defeated. I keep seeing people talk about their most negative moments and keep thinking, “Well, that’s not how I feel on a day-to-day basis,” but around this time of year (just as I am with this post), I feel INCREDIBLY down on myself and write vent poetry and make vent art. But then some days I bounce right back. Others I fight with my partner (like today). I just don’t see what’s what. When is my Autism talking? When is my anxiety too much? When is it my trauma from my mother? When is it Bipolar II? When is it ANYTHING or just having a bad day? I’d really like to hear other people’s daily experiences and maybe lesser known signs of Bipolar II as I found that these helped me realize I had Autism and better understand my ADHD.

2025-10-28 06:01:50;Texting, typing, writing, reading issues?;"Hey y’all, I’m newly diagnosed bipolar 2, also ADHD.
I’m titrating my meds up, but had a gap in healthcare coverage, so I think my mood stabilizer lost efficacy at a low dose, idk. But I’ve been bad this past week. They upped my dose and I’m waiting for my brain to catch up.

I’ve been reading experiences on here, and it seems people tend to lock in during hypo/-mania, but I feel like I lose control of my body bc my brain is going so fast.

I was having a terrible time (absolutely freaking out, pacing, yelling) about a week ago, and I couldn’t manage to text to ask for help. Fingers couldn’t keep up with my thoughts, same for typing. Couldn’t read either, just got really really frustrated. This makes sense, I was upset.

BUT I was feeling a little better a couple days ago, and I needed to burn up some energy. I tried to make a list of chores and got SO frustrated trying to write. Kept trying to start the next word before finishing the last. 

I sat down today for a new list and had no issue.
My handwriting went mostly back to normal, still a little off. 

Why??? Anyone else at least relate to this? 

I should also add that hypomania for me is never a nice experience. It’s just like, depression but at 3x speed.

2025-10-28 05:52:18;Having People Who Know Your Signs Is So Important;"Hello friends. 

I have BP2. I was diagnosed with it over a year ago now and after trying a few different medications, I found an atypical antipsychotic that really works for me. 

I am transparent about my mental health with people close to me such as family and friends because I feel that it helps chip away at the stigma bit by bit. 

Recently, there was a situation at my job that made me super anxious. I off-handedly told a colleague that I check emails and schedule my responses to send at appropriate times when I’m suffering from insomnia. She looked at me and told me that isn’t good. I paused because I hadn’t even considered that behavior being indicative of something greater. But because of her comment, I was able to ask my husband if he’s noticed anything odd and I referred back to a list of triggers for hypomania that my therapist helped me construct. 

Because of my colleague’s comment, I was able to course correct. I forced myself to get extra sleep and abstain from sending emails at 3-5am even if it meant uninstalling the Outlook app from my phone. 

I think it’s really easy with this illness to discredit others who comment on your behavior, but it’s so comforting when you have people in your corner who know you and can help you navigate turbulence. 

I’m doing much better now and the work situation seems to have passed which has eased my anxiety. I also took a day off to gather myself. Please look into FMLA if you haven’t already. ";r/bipolar2;13;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ohrqgx/having_people_who_know_your_signs_is_so_important/
2025-10-28 05:32:24;he discarded me again, should it be for good?;I 20F, was broken up w by my bp1 BF22 this weekend out of nowhere. We had gone out for a few months with each other about a year and a half ago. He broke up with me out of nowhere and I went no contact. He called me that summer to tell me what an amazing person I am and all this stuff, and I just knew he sounded off. That fall I found out over the summer he had been manic and stayed awake for a week straight. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar. I called him that night because I was so worried about him, he reassured me he had a good support system and he was even in a new relationship. Well fast forward to April, his relationship ended and about a few weeks later he reached out to me and asked to see me. I said no (he lives an hour away from me, as he transferred to the smaller school close to his home from our big university, before he ever broke up with me the first time). We talked all summer and saw each other the moment I got back to my university, we have been seeing each other consistently for the last 3 1/2 months. 5 weeks ago he decided to start taking SARMS. He didn’t tell me right away, but once he did I was worried. Since then, his drinking has increased, he hasn’t had much interest in sex, I’ve just felt insanely rejected and like he hated me. We had signed up for a school ski trip together and had a weekend trip planned in a couple weeks, we were even making future plans. In the meantime, his gambling has significantly increased. He’s spending all his time gambling and not much time doing anything else. Saturday night he broke up with me over text. I was worried about him so I contacted his sister and told her about the sarms. His parents (he lives at home) decided to have an intervention with him yesterday. He blocked me on everything. I want to be there for him, but I don’t even know what to do. ;r/BipolarSOs;1;13;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ohr8ar/he_discarded_me_again_should_it_be_for_good/

It doesn't seem to meet some of the hallmarks of bipolar disorder as I understand it.

In 15 years of bipolar symptoms, I've had three manic episodes (2010, 2020 postpartum, and 2023 postpartum). The rest of the time I've functioned well without medication (just struggle with anxiety), and took high doses of SSRIs for that decade in between episodes. I've never experienced a depressive episode. Every manic episode was triggered by the presence or processing of an abusive relationship with a man.

I imagine that I will need a few years without a postpartum period to see where things stabilize--if the manic episodes continue to get worse over the next few years, I'll come to terms with it being bipolar and start long-term medication. But so far, it seems like they're getting less intense, and I'm getting better at coping with triggering men. I do have PTSD--is trauma-induced psychosis a real thing?

2025-10-28 03:07:23;Birth control;"In addition to bipolar I was diagnosed with pmdd. Basically, during luteal phase (like clockwork) every **single** month I get extremely suicidal and full of rage (against myself). It is extreme. 

My obgyn put me on birth control and told me to skip the placebo pills and go straight to the next pack. This way, I never have a period, which sounds not reallllly healthy at all? I've been doing this for several years now. It doesn't help. I have tried several pills too. Honestly, questioning if it makes it worse? Why do I continue? you may ask, because a large part of me has given up on myself and on medication. Questioning if anything will make me feel ""better"" again. 

Having bipolar eats away at me and so does my pmdd. I dread each and every luteal phase because I know I need to stay away from everything, unfortunately I can't escape myself. 

It burns me up, realizing the MASSIVE effect hormones play in all of this. Without having balanced hormones, I truly think I am *ucked. 

My question is, does anyone else have pmdd here in addition to their bipolar? Or if you don't have pmdd and take birth control pills...does it effect your mood negatively? ";r/bipolar;2;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ohnen0/birth_control/
2025-10-28 01:56:43;Bipolar II expressions and advice for a nihilistic and pessimistic view of life.;"I am 21 years old right now and was diagnosed with bioplor 2 when I was 19. I have had two bipolar episodes when I was 18 and 19. Both of which were pretty destructive, and the depression after was pretty horrible, lost a shit ton of weight and felt awful. The manic episodes were very typical, with a lot of drug use and manic behaviour, where I really hurt my loved ones and people close to me. After I was diagnosed, however, I went on lamotrigine, which saved my life and stabilized me a lot, along with quitting weed and doing no other drugs besides alcohol. It has been about a year and a half since the last episode. Life is pretty good overall, considering how shit it's been over the past 4 years.

Although it is a lot better, I have good career prospects and I am about to graduate. However, I still feel a lot of emotional numbness, and I don't really feel much pleasure in life unless I drink. It makes it hard to think that I would be a good long-term partner with so much emotional baggage, and I tend to be very distant when I am in my lesser manic or depressed phase. Having a loving family —A wife and kids — is the dream I have and something I really want. However, with the 25% chance that my children would have bipolar disorder, I really would not want to put them through what I have had to deal with. For these reasons, I don't really see much purpose in my life besides being successful in my career and achieving money-focused goals.

I would like to know if anyone else has had these thoughts, whether they are justified, and how I can change my nihilistic outlook on life. For me, it is just the logical outcome of my experiences. If anyone has similar experiences, I would love to hear about them.";r/bipolar2;9;5;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ohlhvc/bipolar_ii_expressions_and_advice_for_a/

I’m extremely medication-sensitive. Stimulants and antidepressants increase anxiety, severe OCD, sensory overload, and wild mood swings. Very small amounts of **lithium orotate** reduce that “inner pressure,” but only mildly.

I recently tried **lamotrigine**, and it actually helped the OCD symptoms ! But I had a mild allergic reaction, so we stopped. My psychiatrist does not work with other glutamate-modulating meds.

Because of that, I asked about trying a **very low**, sub-therapeutic dose of prescription lithium (not aiming for standard serum levels). She refused, saying lithium can cause **irreversible** kidney/thyroid damage, and she didn’t think the risk is worth it.

I understand that risk at *standard* doses over many years, but I’m not asking for that. I think she may have been spooked by the lamotrigine reaction.

As someone who was diagnosed with bipolar 6 years ago going through cycles of mania/hospitalisation for three years before relative stability (holding down a job with no hospitalisation) how/what did you do to ‘break the cycle’?

Personally I was always against medication so needed to find a way to manage without. I found a meaningful relationship, rewarding and enthusing job, solid self care and sleep routines to be most helpful! Removing negative influences such as hard drugs obviously also helped with this.

I have also found that smoking cannabis (personally) helps me to manage without medication.

I’m keen to know how you guys go about managing without medication and how common that is?

the stress of the relationship impacted my school and work performance (missed deadlines at work and school) and when i eventually decided to cut contact i was very scared that they would show up at my house and became very paranoid. my friends became very concerned for me so they suggested i seek professional help, hence the hospital. i do believe this paranoia was rooted in the reality that this person is unpredictable and i had put an official stop to all contact

part of me feels like my “hypomania” was just normal law school stress…ofc i wasn’t sleeping 8 hours… i was on trial team (probably ~15 hours per week), editor of a  journal, heavily involved with associations, and president of a student org myself while working 20 hours at a firm, and taking 14-16 credit hours per semester… this all seems normal law school to me

i did smoke weed consistently like id wake up 3-4am and smoke a joint and be at the gym by 5:30am, sometimes working out again in the evening. i was also dating someone who would be considered “dangerous,” which ended in me filing a restraining order.

i was off medication for about 10 days waiting for the pharmacy to refill and in that time slept with a gang member (unprotected) and engaged in hard drugs. i knew he was involved in a gang and had just gotten out of jail but frankly i did not really care.

i feel i’ve maintained rational thought, except when i had paranoid ideation that my boss had hired people to follow me around (this is the only thing that feels off about things)

- No risky behaviour such as alcohol or substance abuse 
- No hospitalizations or medical emergencies related to mental health 
- No issues regarding finances, high sex drive, other impulsive or issues with life management 
- No relationship issues related to mental health
- No pressured speech, over the top self esteem ect.

Husband struggles with alcoholism he can be a very angry drunk. His longest sober streak was 1 year. We have known each other for 13 years. 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 at 26 after a really bad episode where I got involved with his brother. My husband had fallen off the wagon and was coming home drunk every night. I started confiding in his brother and we got attached never physical ever. Yeah I know I am a pos for that. I felt like shit about it so I told my hubby. Anyway brother blamed all that on me. Whatever I fucked up more than his brother did anyway so ill take all the heat I definitely deserve it. Told everyone I was crazy and I made it all up. Lol that part still bugs me.

While my husband struggles he stands by my side no matter what. He loves me let's me lose my mind but still loves me because he knows I love him with everything and I do. 

This year 2 events happened. In January I was off my meds for a while. My husband got into a fight new years eve/day which ended in the other party grabbing his arm and dragging him down the road from the window of the truck. I was angry because every time he gets really drunk it ends in chaos. So I blew up the next day and it was really bad we ended up getting physical. Well he forgives me and we move on. I have not missed a day since.Then move forward to July. And he gets to drunk he blows up and gets physical with me. It was pretty bad. But no worse than when I had my blow up. He hadnt drank up until a few weeks ago and he started getting drunk on the weekends again. It upsets me because when I did what I did I knew I had to change not even for him but because I hate that person I become. And im confused why what he did doesnt effect him likr that. Why won't he reciprocate my dedication? I feel unloved honestly but I know he does. I know its his addiction but I still question and im still mad.

This triggered a manic episode. And his brother broke up with his GF. He started coming over to ride dirt bikes and drink. Well he started talking to me and I let that shit go to my head. He was who i relied on when my husband would start drinking. ""If you need me just call me okay?"" Well now my thoughts are going everywhere because I know his brother notices the pattern beginning again and I know that my husband does as well. I see it. His mom sees it and its my fault. I cannot let my triggers control me. 

Ive been pacing. Replaying old conversations. Worrying about possible new ones. I feel like I am having anxiety attacks a lot throughout the day. Im crying a lot. I cant eat. Im sleeping a lot or not at all. I feel like im all over the place. I know my choices are good and its a constant fight in my head. What the hell is wrong with me? Why am I like this? The only thing that has ever worked is just being alone. Im so sick of going throughout the days when im manic going up and down over and over again. Why am I trying to ruin my own life?

Successfully medicated for about a year and a half now, but only got diagnosed and medicated at 43.

Over the last year and a half starting to understand how many things I missed out on during the “before life”. Enormous career and financial mistakes are the big theme in my mind right now. Other times it’s the emotional wreckage and all the people I hurt, and the trauma I inflicted on myself.

I am pretty professionally successful due to some specific skills and had enormous opportunities over the years to get wealthy. Instead I just barely hung on and only lived up to maybe 25% of my potential. Financial and professional self-destruction was a big theme in the last decade before diagnosis. 

Living so many years unmedicated really just piles up the harm, pain, horrible situations. I’m happy to finally be sane and able to build a better life. Just go through the periods where the regret and feeling of missing so much life just stays top of mind.

Once I got off the Lamotrigine again, those thoughts went away. That was an extremely difficult and maybe even traumatic experience for me in my brainspace. I went back on the abilify which was working for a while until my eyes began to flicker left to right throughout the day. I am now only taking 10mg Paxil + 10mg Ambien (+ativan as needed). 

I am afraid to consider trying either the Lamotrigine and abilify again due these side effects. 

Has anyone heard of a Paxil + latuda combination ?

2025-10-27 12:26:18;Sign of psychosis?;"Hiii

A few months ago, I started having these super vivid dreams about someone breaking into my room. They felt so real that I’d wake up in panic and I would even think the dream was real . Since then, I sometimes get this sudden, intense fear that there’s someone in my room or somewhere in the house.

One time, when I was staying alone in a hotel, I got so scared that I couldn’t sleep the whole night and even changed my flight to go home early. It’s been really distressing, and I don’t know if it’s just anxiety or something more, like a symptom of psychosis.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago, but I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Could this be related to manic/depress episodes?

2025-10-27 12:06:14;Hypomania ruined my life.;My hypomania is very atypical and borderlines mania, however I’m not diagnosed with bipolar 1 because my mania doesn’t cause hallucinations/severe impairment, also I am depressed like 90 percent of the time. I had a terrible hypomanic episode which caused me to be extremely angry and sex driven. In a matter of 2 weeks I blew off my relationship with my sister, got in a physical altercation with a female friend of my fiancée and got arrested, and started an OF (which I deleted after I crashed). To me it seems like other people describe their hypomania as “happiness” and “feeling good” however I don’t feel euphoric or really joyful when hypomanic, just mad, impulsive, and just don’t eat or sleep. I crashed hard within the past week and now I’m finally realizing what the hell I’ve done. My relationship with my fiancée was almost completely ruined, my sis (whom I’m very close to) has ghosted me, I’m extremely embarrassed knowing my body is on the internet, and now I’m in legal trouble.

2025-10-27 09:17:30;Feeling safe after a manic episode?;"I (37f) have been with my BPD 1 diagnosed husband (44) for 2.5 years, married for a year and living together. We are located in Iceland, if thats of any relevance.

He started working up to a manic episode over the summer, but it was somewhat manageable during that time. This past week, he hit new levels in the mania and is now in the psych ward. 

He's been medicated the whole time we've been together and seemed to find a good balance in Lamictal, abilify, and elevanse. Then he hit a massive depression, then started to go manic. He started olanzapin on tuesday, but it hardly had an effect. They now increased it since he went into the psych ward.

During the last couple of weeks, his behavior towards me and other has been so close to my abusive ex, and worse. I don't know how i can accept him back into our life without complete and utter fear of this continuing or returning. He became controlling, demanding, knew he could save everyone and everything in the world, became all knowing, wouldn't let me (or others) finish a single sentence while I was talking, and generally just making me feel bad. I feel embarrassed to have him be around other people because the disrespect and self-centeredness is not something I find acceptable. His ego grew, he swings wildly between opinions and then gets mad at me for knowing the wrong opinion and then when I point out ""but you said ____"" he explodes because he needs to be allowed to change his mind. He's still being very self centered and completely oblivious to the fact that he is now communicating with me as his personal delivery service for whatever he might want while in the psych ward. He was stopping me from sleeping because he needed to keep talking, we can't enjoy anything together because all he can do is talk endlessly, pacing, as he tries to explain everything in the world to me.

I have 2 kids (13nb and 11m) who I have every other week. I do not want my husband around my kids like this. They had to endure this kind of treatment from my abusive ex and I swore never again.

I've put a firm boundary that he will not be coming home while the kids are there (he has a brother he can stay with, as well as some other folks he could crash with). He understands and accepts this. We had been trying to concieve, but I have taken that off of the table because I don't think i can parent an infant completely by myself if he goes into a manic episode again and has to be hospitalized.

But how do I accept him again and feel secure? Is there a way to live without constant fear of the next manic episode? Is there a way not to be hypervigilant for signs of abuse going forward? Putting up with negative behavior is something I don't think I deserve, and I'm so scared of what will happen when he comes out. 

Any advice or experience you folks have? 

If I'm missing any info, please feel free to ask questions and stuff. My head is somewhat spinning at this point 😅";r/BipolarSOs;5;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oh1l64/feeling_safe_after_a_manic_episode/
2025-10-27 08:17:44;are these bipolar symptoms? (learning to recognize them);"F25 diagnosed w BP1 and recently moved back in with Mom to stabilize post diagnosis (mixed episode w psychosis) and partly because my family does not trust me to be alone until i’m fully “stabilized”

for the past like 3ish weeks i’ve felt pretty depressed and i traveled out of the country for a few days. now, coming back home to my Mom’s this is what Im feeling, not sure if these are red flags or me just being me:

- i feel irritated at my mom mainly because i feel living with her takes away my freedom 
- if i lived alone, id likely be smoking marijuana frequently (this has always been normal for me through undergrad and grad school)
- i’d likely be having more sex and hooking up (it’s probable it would be w a gang member i hooked up with months ago when i was off meds or someone who gives me the “bad boy” energy vibe) 
- i feel like i also would be more productive in my own space like i feel like i could move at a faster pace but she lives in a “slow” way and it irritates the heck outta me
- overall, i just feel a huge lack of freedom and it feels like a huge sacrifice of my autonomy to be at her place 

mood wise, thought i feel irritated, i feel fine and feel driven to be productive. i have always functioned this way prior to my diagnosis but i really do want to be self aware since this is allegedly a “serious illness.” like i said, ive always functioned this way through undergrad and grad school even. 

are these normal frustrations or symptoms?

2025-10-27 08:16:45;What are your telltale signs that you're moving into a BP2 phase?;"I'm sure this question has been asked before, so I apologize. I was recently diagnosed with BP2, which was life-changing. I've had depression for as long as I can remember (even reflected in journals when I was a child), an anxiety diagnosis in my 20s, and now BPII in my late 30s. I've been on Wellbutrin and Buspar for depression and anxiety for 10+ years, and started on Lamotrigine about nine months ago, which has been incredible.

I'm struggling to learn **what the phases look like**; less because it categorically ""matters"" (which my therapist cautions me against, saying that it more or less doesn't really matter how it's categorized, just that I'm aware of how my moods evolve and shift) and more because I highly value being introspective, self-aware, and in control of how I externalize myself and my moods. I've had moments where I almost click into hypomania or depression, but usually it's something that I don't really notice until it's over. **What are your telltale signs, and how do you manage them, rather than letting them take you on an uncontrollable ride? Or is that just inevitable?**

The experiences and emotions aren't new to me, but realizing that they are BPII -- outsized compared with those who don't have BPII (not comparing or shaming, just observing) -- is a difficult thing to try to control and mute in order to function.";r/bipolar2;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oh0ax6/what_are_your_telltale_signs_that_youre_moving/

so for a while now..building up for maybe around a year, I have been very aware of death. now part of that was just from getting diagnosed and learning the statistics of my diagnosis and suicide..not great. but the last couple of months (about 3) i have found myself not wanting to sleep. 

I have no trouble sleeping, in fact I like it i suppose..or at least I did. but now I just get so much anxiety when it comes to sleeping. this is in part because I feel like its a fast forward to the next day..which means im closer to having to go to work or classes..both of which im not doing good in.

other symptoms of whatever this is:

\* I get really anxious if i am not plugged into my computer: watching youtube, reading blogs, etc  
\* anything outside of that makes me anxious, like im wasting time and death could be right around the corner.

\* outside of that, to avoid sleeping i'll drink a ton of caffeine, shake my head, or hit myself in the head to stay awake

I dont think its mania, because usually when im manic I have something that im really really passionate about. like when im in mania its like I take on a whole new character. I also begin spending a lot, eating more, etc. but i have none of my mania symptoms. just this impending doom that i have to..idk if its the right word but 'prolong' or push back so d-day doesnt come and push my over the edge.

2025-10-27 05:52:15;I don't if it's my surviving mechanism or not.;"I don't know if there should be trigger warning but better than sorry. I talked about depression, bad thoughts and paranoia.

I'm 21 and my psychiatrist is thinking that I might have bipolar. But she said we will have to do couple more sessions to really see. I'm feeling very bad sometimes and I got diagnosed with depression. Than I feel like my body understands that I won't be able to go on anymore so it's turning the switch and I'm the happiest alive. But I don't know if bipolar people feel this. I feel like this is just a surviving mechanism. I went through a lot and still going and I never healed from depression because if you're suddenly cured you forget about the bad stuff and then it comes back. I'm scared that it'll be always like this. I used to think that I'll die. But now I know the depression will pass and after a while it will come back at least I'll be happy for a short amount of time. When I'm like that I feel alive. So I wonder if bipolar people feels this way or it might just be surviving mechanism. Thanks

Also: I have been dealing this since I was a child. When I was 15 my parents finally let me go to the psychiatrist and I got even worse after that. They diagnosed me with depression and prescribed antidepressants. We increased the doses since it wasn't working and my paranoia, the things I believed that I saw and derealization became worse. Then I couldn't let my back then partner to come closer to me because I was so sure that it was not her and I was not in my world and they were all lying. Then her mom took me to hospital and they give me sedative. I relaxed and quit antidepressants. Than I felt okay for a week and then felt like shit. I just don't know what is happening. I am not sure if it is me not being able to deal with my trauma and not being able to ignore it so my brain gives me break so I don't off myself.

Note: I'm not asking for a diagnosis but I don't think I have bipolar. My doctor is thinking and I'm not sure if she understands this is a normal behaviour for someone going through shit. Because I don't know how people who have bipolar feels. İt is really confusing and mental health in my country is not that developed and cared.

2025-10-27 05:42:13;I’ve reached a point of no return;"Hi. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m really scared of my life. I’m 24 and I’ve been an orphan since I was 13. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 16, and eventually BPD, OCD, and PTSD.

I barely finished high school. I was studying the International Baccalaureate, but I wasn’t able to get the diploma, only certificates. Thankfully I had gotten an unconditional offer to university. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in the headspace for it. I got stuck in first year for three years, then dropped out and moved back with my grandma.

I always had this slightly delusional idea that I’d somehow figure it out, that I was smart enough that I’d eventually become someone I’d be proud of. Recently I had the sudden urge to go back into education. It felt like the only way to have some sort of future. I thought maybe now, after all these years, I was in a better place to try again.

My sister and friends told me I should be realistic and look into becoming a hairdresser or something. I’m not saying hairdressing isn’t a respectable job or that you can’t have a good life without education. But I always hoped I could eventually have a job I truly enjoy, maybe even one that could make me financially stable.

For a moment, I really started believing in myself, that I am smart enough, that all those years of struggling with my mental health had just made me believe I wasn’t capable. But my sister and friends kind of crushed that sudden belief and hope I had just built in me.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t accept being nothing. I just always believed I’d be someone. I feel so incredibly hopeless I just feel like I have no reason to wake up in the morning anymore.

I’m 29 years old. I’ve been diagnosed with C-PTSD and bipolar disorder. My C-PTSD is connected to my father’s death in an accident when I was 13. It was a very public event because my father was a known public figure. Since then, I’ve been experiencing mainly dissociative states that can last for up to half a year. During those periods, I feel nothing - I’m dead inside. I can’t form any emotional connection with anyone - not with family, friends, or even animals. It’s like being hollow, lifeless. I also experience problems with spatial orientation and vision - double vision, loss of binocular perception. These states eventually go away on their own after varying periods of time.

When I was 17, I was also being hunted and almost killed for about a year. After that, I began experiencing alternating periods of agitation and depression, which were later linked to bipolar disorder. I’ve sometimes had delusions - but they were rare and passed on their own after a few days. Many people and specialists have connected those delusions to C-PTSD and chronic stress reactions.

I’m also a drug addict with different periods of sobriety. The longest I’ve been clean was 3.5 years. Right now, I’m trying to get my life back on track and will probably go to a private rehab after being discharged from the hospital.

Why am I writing this? Because I’d like to know if any of you with bipolar disorder have also experienced very strong dissociative states. Do you also find yourself feeling absolutely nothing toward anyone for months? And if so - what helps you? I’ve had this happen many times in my life and I’m exhausted by it.

I’ll also continue trauma therapy that’s supposed to focus on dissociation, and I plan to undergo long term therapy for my personality issues. But right now, life feels disgusting - I can’t connect with anyone emotionally, I have visual perception distortions, I don’t react to stimuli like a normal person. It’s as if I’m not alive. The only escape from this state used to be drugs, because they made me feel something. (Yes, I know that’s a poor excuse for an addict, and I’m fully aware of that - but I’m not planning to use again.)

As for treatment - the only medications that have ever worked for me were lamotrigine, lithium, and pregabalin. Everything else was terrible: antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs) destabilized me, and antipsychotics like quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, or cariprazine either made me sluggish, caused akathisia, or just bad experiences overall. Maybe olanzapine helped slightly with dissociation.

Have any of you found medication that actually helps with dissociation? Is there anything you could suggest so I have something to discuss with my doctor?

It’s very possible that if my condition doesn’t improve in two weeks, I’ll undergo ECT - I’ve already signed up for it. It feels like I’ve run out of options.

Has anyone here gone through the hell of dissociation and now manages to live a somewhat normal life? I’m just looking for hope. Maybe someone can share what helped - therapy, medication, where to look for help. I want to get my life back, and maybe, for the first time, actually start living. Drugs have already taken almost everything from me, but dissociation was the original root of all my problems - it always returns and takes everything away again.

To sum it up - have any of you ever felt like this: emotionally numb, disconnected, a passive observer of your life, stripped of interests and bonds with others, just focused on survival, forcing yourself through every day, unable to feel pleasure, with spatial and perceptual distortions?

2025-10-27 02:50:45;diagnosis in UK seems impossible without either waiting a decade, spending a huge amount of money going private or being admitted to psychiatric care;"I've been aware I've had bipolar for years now and it's progressively getting more severe. I'm having more frequent and more severe mania which Is making the depressive episodes so much worse due to fallback. I've been recording my mood daily for months and it's always either 0-2 or 7-10. in the last week I have been sleeping ~4 hrs after 24 hr days and have spunked almost £2k on cocaine, spray paint and CRTs that I don't even have the space for. the shame is unbearable only made worse by memories of my hypersexual / aggressive manic interactions with people. 
 
 if I continue down this path unaided I will be dead or imprisoned in the next 10 years. I've already had 3 close calls in the last few years with hospital admissions for self harm, drug overdose and a severe seizure from benzo withdrawal.

 I can't work, haven't held down a job since 2023, my only income is £80 a week from PIP and my student loans which Ive spent. I already tried going private once spending an insane amount of money to only be rushed through the process and get misdiagnosed as schizotypal (??). 

I recognise I need help sooner than later but the idea of spending so much that I don't have to get such a poor service of care has put me off so much. it doesn't help that I'm terrified of medication too (I have body dysmorphia and severe fear of weight gain, as well as losing my creative drive for my hobbies that are my only healthy outlet for how I'm feeling). 

my family is not really supportive of my mental health, they don't believe in putting labels on ""character traits"" yet they get incredibly angry at me whenever I display any symptoms. attempts to reach out and talk about what's going on in my head gets downplayed and dismissed. I feel so completely lost and that I'm inevitably headed to a position in life I can't come back from.";r/BipolarReddit;3;21;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ogsle1/diagnosis_in_uk_seems_impossible_without_either/
2025-10-27 01:47:30;overwhelming guilt;"Hey guys. i’m recently diagnosed with bipolar II, but it’s honestly been something i’ve assumed i have had for ages because my mother had similar issues.

it’s so hard to deal with this, and I can’t help but hate myself every time I make rash, stupid choices. I have such a loving, caring, boyfriend and I got mad at him last night over something so minute, and even hurt his feelings over him literally buying me something.

I then spent the rest of the night awake, feeling overwhelming guilt but then not texting him because idek. 

I was also in hypomania a week ago and literally committed myself to starting a youtube channel. which btw I hate the idea of being famous because then everyone knows everything about you 🤦‍♀️ I even drew a fucking banner and everything!!! lord.

2025-10-27 01:06:45;I don't know what's happening to me;"I feel like I’m losing it. Everything I think is seemingly incorrect. Each thought is a long and treacherous path that always leads to a dead end. I don’t know what to believe anymore and I can’t trust my own brain. Stringing together a single sentence in regards to how I feel proves to be impossible. I get livid over hypothetical situations that seem so ungodly real to me at the moment. All of my energy goes to what’s racing through my head, but the minute I sit down and try to articulate exactly what it is that’s wrong… all that comes out of my mouth is nonsense. My loved ones try to explain away my feelings with logic; with reality, and I’m always left feeling shameful, completely nuts, or hopeless. It feels like I’m being gaslit… by myself? It feels like there’s another person inside of me. One that can’t shut up about how everyone I love is now against me. My head physically hurts from thinking so much. I don’t know what’s going on with me, and it’s terrifying. No one can see how scared I am. No one knows how to help me anymore. I don’t even know how to help myself. Every time I try to reach out for help, I just push people further and further away with my extreme emotions and volatility.  

I want help. I *need* help. But how do I go about getting it when no one seems to understand what's happening with me, including myself? I'm trying to get on a different medication, but my prescriber (NP under a psychiatrist) isn't great. He doesn't listen at all and refuses to put me on different meds, despite the recent diagnosis. So, now I'm waiting to get in with a real psychiatrist, which is going to take weeks... weeks that I don't have. I don't know how much longer I can take this without a crisis happening. I don't want a crisis to happen. I just want my brain to stop feeling like it's in a high-speed, commercial dryer all of the time. I want to heal. I want to grow. There's just something not right with my head and no one seems to take it seriously unless I'm delivering a package to death's front door.

2025-10-27 00:39:37;Separation and custody;"I need advice on separation and custody of children. 

My husband had a psychotic episode that led to a hospitalization in September for five days. Since then he has been in and out of our home. He says he accepts the diagnosis but he is not in a place mentally to understand what that means and the repercussions it's having on our entire family. 

He is taking meds and was set up to see a counselor. He tried to come home Friday after being out of the home for a couple weeks. He did not last 24 hours before snapping at the kids and us getting into an argument. I should've known it was too soon. I was thinking with my heart and not my head. But also he seemed to do so well the last week. Idk if it's bc he didn't have any triggers or what. But as soon as he comes home he explodes.

He threatened to call the police on me. Wanted me to transfer him a lot of money on the spot. Said he was leaving and not coming back. Our oldest son heard it all and got so worked up he got sick.

I know this isn't healthy. I know he can't come back right now maybe not ever. I need to know from people that have been there what to expect and what to do. Do I go file for custody? I'm afraid that will set him off worse. But I'm also afraid not to file.

I am the primary parent. I work in a school, take the kids to and from where they need to everyday. Is there any chance that a judge is going to grant him custody over me if he tried? I don't want him having overnights or unsupervised visits until he's stable. 

Any advice... please, please help me. I love him so much. I've been with him half my life. But as I told him we have to put our kids above our own wants.";r/BipolarSOs;3;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ogp90u/separation_and_custody/

2025-10-26 23:43:22;Requesting an SSRI?;"I’m at a loss of what to do. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 disorder in July after my first manic episode. As for what caused the mania, that’s where it becomes tricky. I went through a terrible depressive episode back in November 2024 and was put on 50mg sertraline/zoloft. This didn’t lift my depression straight away like most people with SSRI-induced mania claim. In fact, I got much worse before I got better. In January, I actually had my sertraline increased up to 100mg because there was no change in my depression. 

I combined the 100mg with therapy and within a few weeks I finally felt my depression begin to lift and by February I was in the most happy and stable place I ever was. Sertraline at this dose seemed to be working really well for me. Unfortunately, a month later I was offered cannabis on a night out and smoked it for the first time. I really enjoyed the effects of it and this soon turned into an addiction for me. 

My mood continued to gradually elevate whilst abusing cannabis and my sertraline was bumped down from 100mg to 50mg again in June. After family intervention, my cannabis consumption was put to a stop. I sought out HHC vapes again which is essentially a synthetic cannabinoid, but after an unpleasant high, I decided to stop altogether. Around the same time, I forgot to take my sertraline for a few days. Then my elevated mood turned into full blown mania/psychosis with delusions, grandiose ideas, no sleep, racing thoughts, etc.  

My mother pushed for me to be seen by a psychiatrist where I was diagnosed. As of right now, I’m on 10mg abilify/aripiprazole and 50mg lamictal/lamotrigine. However, I am in the pits of depression and anxiety. I was on abilify by itself for the first few months and I really thought once lamictal was introduced last month, my depression would lift but it hasn’t and I’m feeling very hopeless.

I’m experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety in social settings such as racing heart, full body sweats, shakiness, clammy palms, etc. I’ve noticed my social anxiety is getting worse, I’m not able to converse as well as I used to and I’m finding it difficult not to isolate myself from the world. I’m also experiencing intense suicidal ideation and have been thinking about plans. The rumination after my manic episode is also unbearable. Overall, I’m just really struggling with my self esteem and confidence. My self image is the worst it’s ever been and my brain fog is terrible.

In all honesty, I’m really missing sertraline and the effect it had on me before I started consuming cannabis. I miss how stable yet truly happy I was back in February. I’m worried the medication I’m on isn’t going to be sufficient for pulling me out of this darkness. My original psychiatrist was hesitant to put me on sertraline due to the risk of mania but I have a new psychiatrist I have yet to meet with.

I guess I just need some advice. Is there anyone else with bipolar who is successfully on an SSRI/antidepressant? I have the foundation of a mood stabiliser and an antipsychotic, as well as being 3 months post-mania. Should I bring up the idea of adding an antidepressant (ideally sertraline) back into my medication combo? If so, how do I go about being firm? I can’t see this depression lifting without an antidepressant. I understand post-mania depression is normal to an extent, but it’s now been 3 long months of chronic shame, guilt and suicidal ideation. I’ve tried other things like restarting therapy, going to a peer support group, taking mental health recovery classes but nothing is working. I feel so stuck.";r/BipolarReddit;3;8;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ognulm/requesting_an_ssri/
2025-10-26 21:11:28;Partner said that he’s not my therapist after I vented to him;"I was diagnosed with BP2 just over a year ago. Since starting medication I haven’t had any major hyper maniac episodes, but last week I had a major one. 
When I talked to my psychiatrist about it she told me to stop taking my antidepressants as they may have caused the hyper maniac episode (don’t understand how because I’ve been on them for 6months????)

I was talking to my partner last night about how I was feeling, as I’m going through a depressive episode,and asked if he held any resentment towards me because of all shit he has to go through. 
His first response was “I’m not your therapist, we shouldn’t talk about this.”

That really hurt my feelings, because all I wanted was a truthful response on how he was feeling.
I told him that I’m sorry if it came across that way and that I didn’t intend for our relationship to feel like that. 

All I want is someone to talk to in my everyday life, and I understand that might be unfair because they’ll feel burdened by it. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? It’s made me spiral worse and now all I can think about is k*lling myself.

2025-10-26 20:38:14;Confusion with my recent manic episode;"I am Bipolar 1 and 21 years old. For the 2 years I’ve been diagnosed, my manic episodes have always started out of stress and not being able to get it out of my head which would lead to a lack of sleep and then boom manic episode. I’ve only had 2 before this new one so about 1 a year but that is how I have come to understand my mania. I started doing stress management techniques to stay calm or even praying/going into my Bible and I found that helped. 

My last manic episode was late August and it happened right when I came back to college for the fall semester. This is not something new since I spent a whole year at my school. This manic episode started bc I was too excited for church events, seeing friends, and starting classes. Also this manic episode was my mildest one. There was no night where I didn’t sleep at all, the least amount of sleep I got was 4 hours. Also I wasn’t very angry or paranoid and there was no crash and burn like there usually is. I don’t know if it’s the grace of God or what explains why this manic episode was much tamer than my usual. 

My psychiatrist hadn’t even explained it to me so I’m really in the dark and confused about my condition now. I also somewhat fear that this can continue to happen where a manic episode starts out of excitement. I feel like I can’t get too excited about things now.

2025-10-26 20:19:41;Experienced Pseudolymphadema from BP2 Meds;"This is apparently rare, but I (33F)  experienced pseudolymphadema from the limotrigene I was previously taking for my BP2 diagnosis -

I went to the ER earlier this year around the same time I increased my dosage from 50mg to 100mg 1x per day. My face/neck were swollen to about three times their regular size. The doctors didn't determine that there was any issue with the medication as there was no rash. I was ""fixed"" temporarily with steroids/antibiotics for what the doctors speculated could be a bacterial infection.

Went back to life as normal after that but with the swelling under my chin/sides of my throat never quite dissipating all of the way. Continued to titrate my limotrigene up to 200mg under the guidance of my psychiatrist. I will say that throughout this time the medicine did temporarily relieve my intense mixed episodes and intrusive thoughts, but about 5 months in it seemed to stop working for dealing with those things whatsoever.

I was starting to sleep a lot, getting back into bed after only an hour of being awake and then again in the afternoon, felt puffy like a balloon and just assumed allergies/age/environment/event related stress was the cause.

Then, after a huge spiritual reckoning with myself through a guided meditation I had decided to pursue to help with my mental health, my body suddenly broke down and it felt like I was kicking out the limotrigene. I broke down with fever/chills and a swollen, tender face/throat/lower back- I could feel fluid literally moving through my lymph nodes which was super freaky. I didn't mean to get off of the medicine so suddenly without talking to my psych/doctors but I was so inflamed/confused/sick I couldn't get out of bed for 4 days and missed my window to keep taking my medicine without having to start over.

After recovering from that, my face/neck and body is not inflamed at all, which makes me think the limotrigene was reaching levels of toxicity in my body though I can't be today sure. It was like a night and day difference and my loved ones who didn't even know I was on medicine(and then subsequently off of it) commented on my appearance abd overall wellbeing. I am very reluctant to get back on limotrigene at all, or any other medication to deal with BP2 which certainly still affects my day to day life.

I was just mostly looking to share this here as part of my internal processing but also curious to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this on their journey.

2025-10-26 19:59:23;Possibly falling into a manic episode?;"I’m hoping this post gets approved as I need some advice/ support. And before i say more I am in contact with my therapist and psychiatrist and see them this upcoming week so really just wanting to get opinions or feedback from other’s experiences. 

I (23f) think I may be slipping into a hyper manic episode. Over the past 4 years since being properly medicated i’ve really only experienced more of the depressive side of bipolar disorder. I’ve definitely had ups and downs but recently I feel different. Before my diagnosis I struggled a lot when it came to barely sleeping, up at all hours of the night doing random stuff, always acting very irrational and putting myself in harms way and just always feeling like i’m on this big high until I’d come crashing down. 

Fast forward to now. Over the past year i’ve struggled with some health issues which has definitely taken a toll on my mental health however if still been able to manage my disorder decently ok. The past few weeks I have felt a bit numb. it’s like i feel sad in a way but also just nothing. I’ve been struggling with sleep a lot again but have tried to just stay in bed. I’ve had horrible dreams nearly every time i close my eyes of me or my husband dying, him leaving or cheating or just other horrible things involving other family members. 
Recently the one year anniversary of my favorite person, my grandmas death happened. Leading up to it I knew it would be hard for me and my family but then the day of i felt a weird numbness I hadn’t felt in awhile. I knew I was sad yet couldn’t bring myself to even have any emotion throughout the day. Ever since i’ve found myself up all throughout the night wanting to get out of bed and clean or start a craft. Isolating myself from people almost just wanting to be in my own little world. I wouldn’t necessarily say I feel like i’m on a high but I just keep recognizing these old patterns and it worries me I may be slipping into some type of manic episode but also question if i’m just overthinking things. Sorry this is a long post i’m just wanting to see others experiences and maybe some support

2025-10-26 14:04:12;Don’t know how long I can hold;"I (30m) have been with my wife (28f) for the last 8 years. She got diagnosed with BPD 1 as well as ADHD, PTSD, and Depression around 3 years ago. While she always had an issue with depression, we were always able to make things work until 3 years ago. She quit her job, and our lives went into freefall.
 
Over the last 3 years she has not been able to hold a steady job. She has stayed at home trying to get different jobs but has not been able to keep one longer than a week without quiting. We are at the tipping point in our debt where I consistently feel the weight of every financial decision.

She had originally starting seeing a psychiatrist year 1 and taking meds, but she stopped after a few months in due to not liking her psychiatrist and the meds. She now is at the point where she wants to take meds, will see a psychiatrist but doesn’t think it will help, and wants a part time job as she goes stir crazy in the house. I’ve tried to offer other alternatives like going out and about or volunteering, but she turns those down.

She has a first time appointment with a new psychiatrist in 2 months, but the last few months have been difficult. I just feel like I’m at the end of a rope. I feel like with the negative attitude she always has towards treatment, that it’s not going to get better. I just feel so alone, and I have just been in my head about how I feel like I was robbed of my happiness, how I will always have to be the rock in the relationship, and how she will never been able to shoulder the burden in times of need as she breaks at the slightest stress.

I know if it’s been hell for me, she on level 7 of it. She is not in a good mental health space, and our financial situation doesn’t help shield us from the added stress it brings. I just hate this disease as I feel like i see glimmers of her in passing, only for the next second to be thrown into whiplash due to the latest problem. 

I do have a mental boundary set for if she stops seeing the psychiatrist, stops talking her meds, or if issues don’t improve that I will need to step away, as I have been beaten down to a pulp by these years.

And I know it will go away but it's so horrible. I know I need to stop being afraid of the depression. I have a medical kit from psych to minimize side effects but I know I will be empty inside if I take the meds wrong. And the doctor won't help me. It sucks.

I am diagnosed bipolar because of when I started to quit coke and anphethamines, my brain went into full overdrive, and it has been happening everytime I try to quit. I can take less drugs, but I am afraid if I quit I'll loose my shit again. I had never been maniac before and it was the most horrible and scary thing ever not being able to think my thoughts. I acted without thinking. It was the scariest thing ever.

I also can't seem to quit. Even if I stay a year without using, I'll just binge one day and mix with other drugs until I get to feel all the things all at once. I used to think I was antisocial because I couldn't feel anything on the inside without drugs. The meds they give me for bipolar just make me more empty and I binge easier to break through the haze.

My doctor thinks I've quit. I don't know how's it possible. I've never had formal treatment only psych treatment where they act like the drug problem doesn't exist. I don't know what to do. I can't save money for a proper treatment because I spend it all on drugs and I can't go into a free treatment because I would have to be honest about my drug problem to the state which could get me into trouble.

I feel like I’m questioning everything.

It started in March when I had to visit the emergency dept for insomnia (hadn’t slept in four days) and I didn’t remember anything from the prior month, was very confusing for me and was given an AP and diagnosed with anxiety. I was crying hysterically for some reason idk why but when I finally got in with a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with BP2 and given fluoxetine + abilify.

I guess I’ve become more concerned with it more recently. My highs aren’t highs anymore really. They start as highs and gradually turn into something else. They make me feel like I’m dying/want to do risky things like jump into oncoming traffic because I don’t think anything will happen to me. But I don’t feel excessively happy when this happens.

Looking back, I can see that I was probably hypomanic for a long time leading up to June, when things tipped into full mania. Through August and September, I had two distinct periods of psychosis.

During that time, I developed very strong beliefs about my spouse, that they were a bad or unsafe person, and those beliefs felt absolutely real to me. They still partly do, which is really confusing, because another part of me can see that this might have been part of the episode. I ended up making life-changing decisions, including leaving my marriage, and I’m now struggling to know what’s true and what wasn’t.

I tried medication for about a week (a mood stabiliser and antipsychotic) but stopped because I didn’t like how they made me feel. I feel functional. I’m working and managing day to day kind of, but sleep still isn’t normal and I’m preoccupied with thoughts of my spouse…I know something still isn’t right.

For anyone who’s been through this:

	•	How long did it take you to come down from mania or mixed states, especially if psychosis was involved?

	•	Did you crash even if you weren’t medicated, and how long did that take?

	•	What did “coming down” feel like for you?

	•	Did your thinking eventually clear up about the things you believed during psychosis?

I’m scared of crashing, and I’m also scared of going back on meds. Mostly I just want to understand what might be ahead of me and whether my mind will ever feel like mine again.

Thanks for any insight or experiences you’re willing to share.";r/bipolar;4;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1og9g29/how_long_until_i_come_down/

2025-10-26 08:40:33;Does this actually sound like bipolar hypomania or could my dx be wrong?;"I feel like I’m questioning everything.

It started in March when I had to visit the emergency dept for insomnia (hadn’t slept in four days) and I didn’t remember anything from the prior month, was very confusing for me and was given an AP and diagnosed with anxiety. I was crying hysterically for some reason idk why but when I finally got in with a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with BP2 and given fluoxetine + abilify. 

I guess I’ve become more concerned with it more recently. My highs aren’t highs anymore really. They start as highs and gradually turn into something else. They make me feel like I’m dying/want to do risky things like jump into oncoming traffic because I don’t think anything will happen to me. But I don’t feel excessively happy when this happens. I can still somewhat relate to the symptoms of hypomania (like overspending) but it’s not every symptom. 

Does that still sound like hypomania? Or could it just be severe depression/regular ups and downs that non bipolar people have?

2025-10-26 06:46:39;Feeling great after my meds have been adjusted, but can I trust it?;"Hello, everyone. I posted this to r/Bipolar2 as well. I hope it's okay that I post it here too.

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II for a year and a half now, and two years before that with Bipolar Mixed States. Just to give context.

A week ago, I told my psychiatrist I think of ""ending"", sometimes. She immediately changed my antidepressant from 300mg once a day, to 225mg three times a day. So it's been about a week now that I've been on the adjusted dosage.

It's Sunday now. Friday night I had the urge to go be social, despite being sick, despite being an introvert and basically a hermit. I stayed home. Yesterday I was filled with energy, I slept a lot (around 10 hours), and I was full of energy the whole day. Went to the hospital for my rheumatologist without procrastinating. Didn't care that he wasn't in at that time. Went home, read a lot. Wrote a bit. Had a two hour phone call with a friend. But I felt happy and energetic. Music makes me feel great again.

Last night I went to bed early - around 21:30, and had a dream that woke me up at precisely 03:00. So I've been awake since then, and it's 06:33 right now. I haven't felt the need to go back to sleep. Usually I'm always fatigued. I'm listening to upbeat music. I have work I need to do by tonight, but instead I've already started on it - I'm just taking a break to write this post.

But I'm happy. I'm not used to this, so I don't know if I can trust it or not. I'm usually more on the depressive side, with rare hypomanic bursts (a few hours at most). I still think about the ""void"", but more in passing than thinking I want to disappear. I already decided I'll leave my apartment for the first time in weeks (besides going to work) today to go have hot chocolate at Starbucks. I want to write while I'm there, which I haven't done in a long time.

It's been so long since I've felt normal, true happiness - literal years. So how do I know if this is normal or not? What distinguishes the fact that the antidepressants are doing their job, versus hypomania? Am I overthinking it?

I'm not asking for medical advice, just personal experience in differentiating between the two.

2025-10-26 06:15:19;being bipolar during relationship struggles;"hi all, new account for anonymity. i just hope someone here can relate and that i’m not alone.

i’ve been with my husband for several years, married for 1, and i knew we weren’t in the best place but he recently told me that for him our relationship is over. i won’t delve into all the details because this isn’t the place for that, but one thing that was a contention point between us was that from 2021 to 2024 i was actively going to see a psych and counselor for being bipolar, and in the last year i’ve stopped counseling and only see my psychiatrist to refill meds. he would constantly try to pry me open emotionally and kept telling me i need to get back in counseling, but i didn’t listen. i know for sure i was in a somewhat manic phase for quite a bit this year, even with my meds. i didn’t think i needed counseling. i didn’t fully think about how the things i was doing and the ways i was acting were affecting him. and i can admit that is selfish.

i want to make our relationship work so bad, but i also feel like being with me must be hard. i was blinded by mania and thought everything was great and everything would be fine even though i was behaving recklessly. i don’t want to say that being bipolar ruined my relationship or that it’s ruining my life, because i need to take responsibility for my actions, but it really feels that way right now. being diagnosed with bipolar helps me see patterns in my behavior and helps me understand why i feel and think the ways i do sometimes, but i feel like it’s so easy with this disorder to drop the ball no matter how self aware you think you are. i know somewhere deep within myself that i’m not alone. i’m not the only bipolar person who feels like this disorder has ruined their relationship. but right now i feel so alone, and like being bipolar is going to ruin every aspect of my life.";r/bipolar;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1og48ze/being_bipolar_during_relationship_struggles/
2025-10-26 05:54:59;why do you choose to medicate?;"F25 and was recently diagnosed with BP 1 w psychotic features during a hospitalization in May of this year. currently on an antipsychotic and SSRI.

sometimes i can’t help but question if i really am “sick,” though ive learned that questioning it is part of resisting the diagnosis. at this point, im only convinced i do have bipolar mainly due to lack of insight/judgment on certain decisions ive made when not medicated.

im thinking of my “Why I choose the medicate” reason. obviously being unmedicated feels better, i am high functioning during hypomania and depression— it’s truly just the mania and psychosis that do scare me.

its taken months for me to accept that i did have psychosis and that i had delusions. i did not have the “i am god” delusion but mainly just a lot of paranoia that folks were plotting against me.

why do you choose to medicate? how have you learned to accept psychosis or just the fact that you are “sick”?

i am med compliant but its a constant battle i fight on the daily with my mind to take the medication.

edit: thank you guys so much for sharing your “whys” it’s really really helping and making me see truly how important med compliance is. 

i was not aware of kindling hypothesis and holy wow! i found this study and yup i will definitely be adhering to my APs. had no idea it could turn treatment resistant!

2025-10-26 05:20:19;I wanna feel anything so I’m making them hate me;"This is hard to talk about, but better late than never. 

I got diagnosed when I was a sophomore in college it’s been….. well …. Yknow. 

I’ve been living w these roommates since July and it’s great, I love them so much. They actually care about me and we support each other and it’s turned into a beautiful sisterhood. I’ve been having this intense depressive episode. Like scream crying at night outside, putting myself in dangerous situations, and picking fights over absolutely unnecessary bullshit. I’m not usually this volatile. 

This morning one of my roommates got into a really stupid fight. I can acknowledge that a big player in this is that I’m naturally really messy and it’s a huge insecurity of mine. I always feel like I’m too filthy and disgusting to love. And I did let it get bad recently as I was home alone struggling with this episode and I let everything get away from me. My mind has convinced its self they both hate me and want me gone. 

Well I blew a fuse over my roommate cleaning up, specifically moving my medications. I always keep them by my coffee maker so it’s like right there in the mornings and I remember to take them. I bit her head off over putting them away and she said she wouldn’t do it anymore but I feel like an ass and idk how to apologize and make it meaningful. Or how to explain my symptoms are part of a larger problem and I can’t guarantee it won’t happen again.

2025-10-26 02:43:12;My SO of 3 years suddenly broke up with me;"My bf and I have been living together for 3 years. When I met him he had a pretty severe episode and was hospitalized but eventually recovered. We have great compatibility but some struggles with communication. I don’t think it’s anything that can’t be solved by just having an honest and open conversation. Additionally I was also very upfront about my standards and expectations about dating/relationships and he happily accepted them.
He was honest about his diagnosis from the beginning stages of dating and I think overall our relationship was pretty good. Also he is medicated and knows about his diagnosis for over 10years. Through out the years we were together I put on a lot of weight and he told me several times how distressing it to him and I explained that I don’t like it either and I’m trying to best to manage it. 

I understood when he was stressed and I tried my best to support him during these times. Many times when he was going through a difficult time I picked up the emotional slack of the relationship. Over time I noticed he doesn’t have the best coping skills for managing stress.  When something very stressful happens he usually starts to drink and smoke weed. 
Since the end of 2024 he had a major stress trigger and started to emotionally shutdown. 

However since about the start of 2025 he started excessively drinking and sleeping. This started to negatively impact our relationship and I let him know several times that I feel like he doesn’t want to spend time with me and that’s why he sleeps all day. We still occasionally did things together but definitely started to grow apart and live almost parallel lives. I started to get very upset about it but knowing he is going through a difficult time I just stayed quiet and kept going. I feel at this point he partially emotionally checked out of the relationship. 

He didn’t plan anything for Valentine’s when I got him a gift. I think he forgot our anniversary in September and didn’t plan anything either when I got him something. This made me very upset and ignored. In September when I thought that he forgot about our anniversary I cried and told him that he if doesn’t want to be with me he should just be honest and say so and that we can break up cordially. He remained quiet and took me out to dinner. I once again decided to get over the hurt of the situation.

 I also told him that we barely spent any time together in the summer and he took me on a trip out of state in the beginning of October. The trip went great we didn’t argue/fight and we both had a great time. When we returned home my birthday was coming up and he didn’t ask me about what I want to do/what present I want until 2 days before. I told him what I maybe wanted and he brushed it off saying my parents should get me that instead. 

The day of my birthday everything blew up. He left to work and I was waiting for him to get back from work. On our way to dinner he seemed very nervous and was complaining about things at work. At the restaurant he got drunk and wanted to go to more bars after even though I said I didn’t want to. Eventually we get home and I come see that he reused the crepe paper from a gift that I got him before. He noticed my face and asked what’s wrong and I all the piled up emotions came to surface. I told him that I got very upset that he reused the paper from the gift I got him and why didn’t he budget enough time to gift wrap my gifts properly. He blew up and told me to go back to my parent’s house while he was drunk. I looked him straight in the face and asked him if that’s what he wanted and he said yes. 

I went to sleep on the couch and next morning I asked him if he has anything else to tell me and he said not at the moment. I asked him if he is serious about breaking up and he said yes, saying that it seems to him our values and expectations don’t align. And also because I couldn’t explain to him some line of code last night and some other stuff that made no sense. He also asked me what plans do I have tonight and that I can start packing my essentials. Later that day he asked me if I wanted to see my presents and I told him no since last night he told me that I won’t be getting them. At this point he ruined my whole birthday weekend and I had to hide my emotions and pretend that everything is okay when I went out with my parents on the weekend. 

After I came back home from my dinner with parents he acted as though nothing happened and I was so angry and upset I refused to talk to him. He then tried to talk to me in the kitchen the next day and I broke down crying saying that if that’s what he really wanted why didn’t he pick another day to do this. He apologized but didn’t say much else. I was crying so much and telling him that I don’t deserve this. He told me he still likes me but I told him that you don’t do this to someone you like. Later that day I spent the week Housesitting and he texted me saying he knows we have to talk but he hasn’t been emotionally available and that I’m owed a thought out apology. Since then we didn’t talk much and I came down a bit. I invited him to a small family dinner for my birthday but he declined saying he is too tired to go. 

When I tried to talk to him again and asked him to be honest and tell me if break up is what he wanted he didn’t give me a definitive answer at first. He was half asleep and I told him that if he feels that he doesn’t love me we deserve to be with people who love us. I told him that I think we do have great compatibility but our communication broke down and he agreed but said that communication should t be this difficult. I suggested we should work on our issues but he said he doesn’t see how they can be worked out. I asked him if it’s the weight gain that makes him not want to spend time with me and he reluctantly said yes. He also said that before a lot of things in our relationship were better, we used to do more things together etc. But he doesn’t seem to understand that for that to happen he can’t be withdrawn and sleeping all day. He also told me some other things that didn’t really make much sense in the context. He was okay with talking about non relationship stuff.

When I came home later that night he moved to the couch and gave me the bed saying he doesn’t want me to be uncomfortable. I also asked him if he can drive me to the airport the next day and he agreed. The day of my trip when I was packing he asked when I was coming back and I said I’m not sure yet. He then insisted I come earlier so that I can pack my stuff but then said he doesn’t know and maybe I need to come back in 2 weeks. He also said that he doesn’t want to leave me in a bad spot. We drove to the airport in silence and he put my birthday card with part of the gift he got me in my purse. He dropped me off texted me to make sure that I got through security and wished me a safe trip. 

We haven’t spoken since then and it has been a week today. I called his father earlier and asked if he has spoke to him recently and if he was okay. His father assured me that yes and he sounded fine. I also asked him if my bf told him anything else and he said jsut that we broke up. 

I just feel so emotionally torn and hurt. I can’t believe that after 3 years of living together and our lives being so interconnected that’s how it all ends so suddenly. It kind of feels like he fell out of love with me in a matter of days and discarded our relationship. 

I’m staying with family and trying to keep it together but it’s very hard with everything going on. After sometime I realized that the core issue of our relationship problems is his poor stress management skills and my emotional overcompensation. Please offer your opinions and suggestions. One part of me wants to just move on and another to work things out. TIA ❤️";r/BipolarSOs;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ofz8fc/my_so_of_3_years_suddenly_broke_up_with_me/

First i get quite anxious (I don’t get anxious normally) and somewhat depressed maybe for two weeks

After that I get dysphoric hypomania for couple of weeks and after that mixed for about one week 

After that I crash and get mild to moderate depression for under a month but more than two weeks. 
 
Then I get euthymic for maybe a month or more (I think i might have mild swings in mood but benumbed to thoes). 

I have had these major swing through autumn to spring (might be seasonal effect plus more stress) and in summer I usually have milder swings. This autumn I really haven’t had these, maybe my medications work! 

I only read about long lasting depressions and i really dont have those. My physiatrist thinks I might have had cyclothymia before, can this be explained with that? I might need some validation for my diagnosis :D of course i understand that everyone have different course of illness but I feel that mine is so different from others

2025-10-25 22:42:49;I Don’t Feel Like I Have Bipolar Anymore;"I have a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder. In June 2025, my antipsychotic was decreased pretty significantly. Everything was fine until a month-ish later (around middle of July 2025). That’s when things started to go lopsided. 

The whole experience has left me with an inability to connect with my feelings regarding that time period, so forgive me, but I’m going to use clinical language to describe my experiences. 

Essentially, I was swinging up into mania, down into depression, rapid cycling (every 2-3 weeks there would be a pole shift), having delusions and hearing voices. 

I had no idea that I was unwell until recently. I’ve been in the mental health system since I was 15. I was used to crying in front of the CAMHS team, but I’ve never cried in front of the adult mental health team. But once I realised that I had been very unwell and was hearing voices (which I should have obviously recognised) I sat and cried to my care coordinator. 

I needed an appointment with my psychiatrist, but my psychiatrist’s clinic is completely backlogged. Thankfully, my care coordinator has a meeting with him every 1-2 weeks. She brought my symptoms up and my psychiatrist wrote a letter to my GP, upping my antipsychotic dose to what it was before I became unwell. Thankfully, I didn’t even have to talk to my psychiatrist because I’m not in a state to explain the last few months again to anyone. 

I’m back on the dose which kept me well. And now I just don’t feel like I have a mental illness anymore. It’s not because of some sort of, “Oh I’m 100% okay now.” Although, I’m certainly feeling more relaxed and grateful for the peace. 

I am still 100% committed to taking my medication, because I know what happens when I don’t take it (logically). But emotionally, the last few months are not registering. There’s some sort of fog or haze surrounding the whole thing. 

I have almost always had insight into my condition. Even during delusional periods, I would have moments of lucidity- but not this time. Truly, I don’t even know how or why I suddenly gained insight in October. Mental health professionals have always complimented me on my insight and ability to articulate my inner workings. 

Now, given that my insight was completely diminished, it’s like a grave injury to my soul. 

I just don’t know who I am anymore. 

There is no emotional connection to the events which led to my antipsychotic being increased again- and yet, I feel as though maybe this experience has traumatised me. 

The vague memories I have feel like they aren’t mine- almost as if I have been observing someone else’s mental illness. 

I’ve always resonated with the bipolar diagnosis, but this time, I feel so detached from it. I feel so detached from everything. 
Logically, I know that I’ve been unwell. But other than that, my mind is so mixed up. 

I guess this is the best way to describe it: I’m like a box of chocolates which has been tossed up into the air and my chocolates have been strewn everywhere

2025-10-25 19:34:28;Increasing severity of manic episodes over time?;"Did anyone else's SO's manic episodes start out pretty benign/unnoticeable and then become more extreme? And if so, what is the rate at which they become more extreme? My husband just had his first major manic episode and was diagnosed with BP. But looking back, I recall that he had a couple others over the last 7 years:.

First episode, 7 years ago: He wasn't sleeping and was working on a scientific theory that was quite ground-breaking, wrote it basically all in one go, and got it published in a major journal. and then he did a lot of trauma processing while on mushrooms and had such big ""somatic shifts"" that he could barely move for a month.

Second episode: A few years later, a similar thing happened where he took a lot of psychedelics again as part of ""awakening"" work, and ended up writing a whole academic book that was well-received in his field, again basically all in one go, and without sleeping much. It culminated with him doing some somatic breathwork that caused him to pass out and getting a concussion.

There was arguably not much straight-up delusional content in these manic episodes. However, in this third episode, he felt like there were all these synchronicities happening in the universe that were aligning to call him to do certain work, and that he had jesus-like powers, and one of the things he was called to do was help a client with some trauma stuff, and they ended up having an emotional affair, but in his mind it was actually just ""healing work"" and he thought i would've been ok with it because my higher self would've understood. In the post-manic comedown (which I think is dysphoric hypomania/mixed state), he has been angry/blaming towards me (for the first time in the 7 years i've known him), and it's been awful, as i haven't always known what is due to the illness and what is coming from ""the real him,"" and whether those two can ever really be separated now.

He's now taking medication and seems like he plans to continue to do so. But I'm wondering if each episode is going to go increasingly off the rails. i have massive trust issues and betrayal trauma is like my core wound, so i can't go through what happened this past time again.";r/BipolarSOs;15;29;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ofpal6/increasing_severity_of_manic_episodes_over_time/

Being a part of it and just reading on here has made me feel better about being bipolar. Been diagnosed for 3,5 years and been through some ups and downs (no pun intended). Partners trying to pin it against me, a ridiculous amount of times when i’ve cried over something they’ve done to me, have i heard the god forsaken «have you taken your meds lately?»

Spent so much time hating myself for being so emotional, so much time trying to explain my reactions (never abusive), locking myself away. Not to mention sporting myself when i feel super sexy and divinely protected, walking around like i’m y2k Britney Spears - and the time i’ve spent cringing afterwards. 
I’ve felt weird and out of place for so long. Too sensitive for this world.

I wanna just say thanks to everyone in this sub because i feel so seen. I don’t often post or comment, but the things i read make me feel normal. Even cool! There are so many good things about being bipolar too, like a lot of us are really intelligent and artistically gifted! I think that’s awesome because i love art in many forms. Poetry and beautiful paintings make me cry, and i’m thankful for being able to feel emotions that deeply. 

Love you all and hope you’re having a good day 🥰  (but not suspiciously good 🤪)

2025-10-25 15:32:27;I wish I could just be happy;"I feel so euphoric and happy. It almost feels like I cant contain it and cant catch my breath. I am fully aware this likely isn't a good sign and thats not what this post is about. I am not looking for advice, just want to share my experience and hear frorm others. I am keeping myself safe.

I just want to share it with everyone and enjoy it and I feel like my diagnosis has robbed me of some of the joys in life. I cant share it, I cant enjoy it. People worry, they want to put a stop to it before it escalates. 

Before my diagnosis, I didnt even consider that most people dont get to experience this feeling. Even drugs cant replicate it but even before diagnosis i can remember distinct memories of feeling like this and genuinely looking for signs id been drinking or gotten high and forgotten about it. 

At my last psychiatrist appointment, i shared my concerns about begining lithium (which i have been taking since) and she was really good about everything. One thing that caught me off guard and really made me think, was when she said she sometimes wishes she could feel mania or hypomania for just 24hrs. Ofc she knows better than anyone the horrors it can lead to and that mania doesnt always feel good. But she hears people like me everyday, talking about this amazing feeling. A feeling so incredible we ruin our lives just to feel it. A feeling she will never know. I dont blame her. 

Although interestingly, when I look back on these memories, they didnt actually lead to an episode. It would usually only lasted a few hours, a few days at most. I know i cant take that chance anymore, but I miss it. I miss the feeling of pure ecstasy without ruining my life. Just being happy and enjoying it. Now I can't. Now I need to pretend I dont feel as great as I do. Now I need to see a doctor because im too damn happy. Who'd have thought.

I now realize that I am experiencing mood swappings and sometimes things don't make sense. 
I complain to my psychiatrist about terrible insomnia and then I sleep too much. 
I am very excited and then sad. 
It doesn't make sense, I'm afraid people will think I'm lying, that I'm crazy.

I just got diagnosed with borderline (definitely agree with that), persistent depressive disorder, and GAD. I have a prior ADHD diagnosis, too. My first psychiatrist thought I had bipolar 2, but I just got a neuropsych eval (from a clinical psychologist) that said it was persistent depressive disorder rather than bipolar 2.

Curious on thoughts, opinions, whether the label of PDD vs. BD makes much of a difference or not…in some ways I feel much better having a diagnosis of persistent depression rather than bipolar 2 because I’ve never been *sure* if I have been manic or hypomanic, but also, how would I know if I have been or haven’t?

Currently on Vyvanse 30 mg (sooooo key for day to day stability), lamictal 200 mg, and seroquel 50 mg for sleep. I think I’d like to go down to seroquel 25 and take it just as needed.

2025-10-25 09:24:48;medicated SO pushing boundaries;"currently about 7 months post bipolar 1 diagnosis/manic episode. my husband is medicated with lamictal.
his manic episode was largely triggered by a weed bender which lasted 2 months. throughout his life he’s used weed to cope with mood swings/boredom, and part of the agreement to getting back together (we were separated during his episode) was that he would no longer smoke weed. so far he’s kept up that promise. however, he mentioned to me that he would like the freedom to smoke weed on occasion when out with friends. he said he would never buy any from a dispensary. just wants to do it every so often. this caused a huge fight and i held my boundary that if he were to begin smoking again (even socially) i would consider divorce. 
we have an 18 month old daughter and due to the severity of his manic episode, i had to get a PPO against him to protect her (and me). weed exacerbates his mood swings significantly and i don’t think him being medicated gives him an “out” to start smoking again. i told him i’d be extremely triggered if he came home high and i would not want to be around him. 
am i being too harsh for holding this boundary? i dont want to be a controlling wife but i truly think its a slippery slope with addicts, if you give them an inch they will take a mile.. ";r/BipolarSOs;7;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1off0xm/medicated_so_pushing_boundaries/
2025-10-25 09:09:19;Productive Mania;"TLDR: Being productive when manic can hide the mania/hypomania.

My son has Bipolar 1, as you know it’s often genetic (I’ve got BP2, and his mother’s side has BP1). He was only diagnosed at the beginning of this year following an incident at home. 

He’s lived with me full time since he was 12, following us getting divorced. From around 12-15/16 he’d go through “cleaning” phases and be spring cleaning the house obsessively. That changed when he was about 16 and got into drugs and then we dealt with drug sprees every 6-8weeks for years. 

Since he was diagnosed and medicated, we haven’t had any drama, and I know his “cycle” is roughly 6-8 weeks. I’m on a similar cycle and get moody and sleepless every 6 weeks or so, the point my ex used to joke that I was on my period (wasn’t diagnosed till long after divorce).

This morning, I heard my son up at 5am doing a cleanup of the back garden, then cleaning the kitchen and his bathroom. Had his music on and all happy to be getting the home and garden spotless for me. Not complaining as getting 25 year old boy to be clean and tidy is exhausting! 

Being more knowledgeable now, it is pretty clear that he’s in early stage of mania. Spoke to him and he’s run out of meds and hasn’t taken them for a week or so. 

I’m glad he’s back to healthy outlets for his energy. I’ve always been positive when hypomanic, with extra hours and effort at work, signing up and training for triathlons etc. 

I’ve got mixed feelings about the hypomanic episodes and my son’s milder episodes when they are positively focused. It feels good to achieve things,just sucks to crash afterwards.

2025-10-25 07:11:43;Discrimination at interview;"I recently had an interview for a volunteering role and I was rejected on the basis of mental health issues. I didn’t want to disclose that I have bipolar disorder, but I felt pressured as she was pushing me to go into detail about my health and why I’m currently not studying or working. 

I regret saying it, but like what else was I meant to say? I didn’t feel “none of your business” was appropriate to say at an interview. 

I wasn’t asked about my experience or skills. Instead it was “how long have you been on medication?”. I told her I’m currently stable but she had already made up her mind. I was told to go see doctor and ask them about roles that wouldn’t be  too ‘emotionally taxing’.

I was told volunteers have to be ‘bulletproof’. Yet it was a role I easily could have handled as it was remote and only a couple of hours a week. 

Has anyone else experienced discrimination due to bipolar? I was only diagnosed recently and am shocked this has happened to me already. It was humiliating and I feel so alone. 

People treat me like I’m fragile but I’ve been through hell the past couple of years and I’m still standing.

The hours were quite erratic, some nights I’d get 4 hrs, other nights 9 hrs. But the average levelled out to 7 hrs a night overall. My sleeping hours were disrupted e.g. sleeping during day but not at night, but without a massive decrease in hours slept? 

I’m confused as to whether this was really mania if my average sleep a night during a period of erratic behaviour wasn’t significantly lower than usual. Has anyone else had this? (I was diagnosed recently.)

2025-10-25 06:06:17;Concerned;"Hey I'm mom who has a daughter She is 22 years old. After  the family PA, diagnosed her with ADHD, she is getting treatment for that. I know and have known for a while that she is ADHD. She also suffers from ocd and depression.

I recently was prescribed adderall.My pdoc and I opted for the extended release and it's made my life so much better. She saw how much I responded to treatment.And it really has made a difference for me.

Her new doctor agrees with the ADHD diagnosis, and prescribed her with a single dose, I think 10 mg to take daily.

She has grown restless and says she can't get up in the morning without it.And that she needs to take it, so she can study. I have been telling her that she needs to try the extended-release. 

She says she gets a rush after she takes it, and then she crashes late in the afternoon afterward. She thinks she needs it to be able to wake up in the morning and go to school. I know that she is having crashes. Because I have observed her behavior and see the initial morning rush in the crash around 3 PM.

She said her and her pa said that she needs to take one in the morning. Along with the extended-release, I feel that this is entirely too much. The way that she talks about this drug is one that sounds like she is drug seeking, I told her that, and now she won't talk to me now. I told her that the dr  wouldn't give her that combination. It's not like she's taking the medicine incorrectly. It just concerns me that she wants more. Has anybody taken the daily pill and the extended-release at the same time? 

I know this is not our normal.
discussion here, but I'm getting very concerned because her father was a drug addict. I was in the scene for a bit and that's all the lingo people would say to me when they were looking to score.

Am I freaking out? Is this common? We never fight like this, she is fully aware of my past. She thinks she knows more than me.

2025-10-25 01:28:34;Anyone else watch any of the Gucci Mane bipolar interviews? His wife’s role really triggered me;"I just watched a few of the interviews Gucci Mane and Keyshia Ka’Oir did to promote his book ""*Episodes: The Diary of a Recovering Mad Man*,"" and I have SO many feelings. Did any of you watch it?

The gist: Gucci shared that he was diagnosed with Bipolar and Schizophrenia. Keyshia explained that she can tell when he’s about to have an episode, and when that happens, she takes over which includes removing social media apps, calling lawyers, and even coordinating with SIX bodyguards to involuntarily admit him once. She likened it to being a parent. Gucci thanked her and acknowledged that his environment, including drugs, contributed to his episodes, and he wanted to do better for her and their kids.

Here’s why the interview pissed me off, the internet’s reactions made it worse. Half called her a “handler,” the other half lauded her as a martyr and compared her to what Kim K “should have done” with Kanye. I'm not even a Kardashian fan, but that pissed me off. That comparison triggered me hard, after being with a Bipolar spouse who abused finances, gaslit, cheated, and showed zero awareness or remorse even after the hospitalization and the psychosis/mania faded. Anyways, here's my thoughts/ramblings. 

1. **Privilege.** Good for her for standing by him, but she has bodyguards, lawyers, and money. Hell, his family didn't even take my concerns seriously and told me I was emasculating him. 
2. **The “good wife” narrative is dangerous.** She said a good wife stands by her man even when he says terrible things and confronts him without fear. That kind of advice could get someone hurt. She had protection; I don’t.
3. **Recognizing episodes is exhausting.** I can usually tell when an episode is coming, but it’s draining, and my concerns are often dismissed by my SO and healthcare providers. Not everyone can call lawyers or bodyguards at the first sign of mania or psychosis.  Many of us can barely call family.
4. **Caregiver burnout is real.** Keyshia looked exhausted and swollen in the interview. I know that face. I have that face. It’s the toll of being a full-time caregiver.
5. **Accountability makes the difference.** Gucci seems to be sober, taking meds, and getting treatment. That’s huge, but it doesn’t erase the harmful messaging for the average person, especially when you SO don't always take that accountability.

I guess I want to know if any other partners watched this and felt a mix of frustration, anger, and exhaustion? I'm glad she's speaking out on it, but the message was borderline harmful in my opinion.

2025-10-24 22:01:15;Terrified of suspected bipolar in SO;"My husband (40m) and I (38f) have a kiddo (3) and are expecting a second. We’ve been happily together for 12 years and married for 8. Our relationship has been extremely strong and stable, even when tested (such as doing a few years of long distance in grad school). 

My husband is a survivor or child abuse and neglect from both of his parents, who divorced in middle school. His mom physically and emotionally abused him and his dad emotionally abused him. Physical abuse is his first memory and stopped at ~16 years old. His father also struggled with substance use. His father passed away unexpectedly when I was 7 months pregnant with our first a few years ago. 

My husband has dealt with the lingering effects of the abuse, and has been in therapy on and off our entire relationship. He has relies on therapy, exercise, and my support to manage these consequences. He has healed and grown so much, and despite occasional bouts of depression and self esteem issues, has been stable and happy family man for a decade. 

Before we met, I always said I never wanted kids. He always knew he wanted kids and that being a dad was his real calling. Over the years I warmed up to it- mostly because I could see that he would be such an involved and passionate parent. We had our first child, and even though my husband was in the throes of grief from the loss of his father he handled it wonderfully. He has been a fantastic dad. He changed every diaper. He was up for every feeding day and night. While I did more logistical challenges for the baby he did most of the labor challenges. He also has done all of the school pickups and drop offs. 

Things had been going amazing well- our careers have been doing great, our kiddo is the most joyous and on the easy side for a toddler, and our relationship was feeling great. We had long planned to start trying for #2 in late spring, and went for it! He was very excited about having 2 and very onboard. 

My kiddo has been in a preschool that we absolutely loved, and everything was going great there too. But my husband struggled with boundaries with the school, feeling such a deep sense of appreciation to his teachers for doing things his parents couldn’t even do for him (providing loving and supportive care) and seeing our kiddo develop skills he struggles with (especially confidence and self efficacy). I intervened in things like writing too personal of thank you notes for teacher appreciation day. But overall seemed to be going well and we had a very friendly relationship with his lead teacher. Unfortunately the director left the school, throwing it into turmoil. We were without a director all summer and there was a ton of staff turnover. My husband was extremely disturbed by watching the school fall apart. 

We then had a conversation in early spring about his boundaries with the lead teacher  (23f). They had several more personal conversations (about her family fleeing their home country and about philosophy) during pickup and drop off, and it was clear that he was too invested in her. He actually initiated the conversation with me about it and it seemed like he had the revelation that he needs to reaffirm boundaries and that the power differentials made a friendship not appropriate. We made a plan for us to go to pick up and drop off together.

My husband always said he had a processing disorder. He tends to pathologize his behavior, thinking he is “extra broken” because of his trauma. I always told him to get tested if he really thought he had a processing disorder. But he never did. After hearing someone talk about being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, he felt his experiences were super similar and finally wanted to take action to get tested. I helped him set it up and he was tested in the early summer, essentially right after we tried for the baby and before we found out if we were pregnant. The psychiatrist who did the testing also asked him a lot about the childhood abuse and her initial impression was that he has symptoms of ADHD but they could stem from the severity of abuse instead of ADHD but she would look more into it. That sent him into a total mental health spiral. She followed up a few weeks later that she felt he had enough symptoms to diagnose him with ADHD. 

The process was very difficult for him: he was reliving the trauma through talking about it with a new person, the initial hesitation about diagnosis made him feel that the abuse and trauma had both taken something else from him (the ability to be diagnosed), the chaos in his household as a child likely contributed to him suffering without diagnosis for his whole life, and the actual diagnosis also rocked him (changing his perception of himself). 

We found out shortly after that we were in fact expecting a baby. He said he was super excited, but it was clear he was suffering from mental health issues. He struggled to sleep for days on end. He was withdrawn, depressed, and very obviously struggling. I tried to support him, but he was withdrawing and I felt extremely alone in the pregnancy. In July I broke down and was bawling in the bathroom in the middle of night and he found me and I shared very realistically how sad and alone I felt and how I was vulnerable during pregnancy and really needed him to pull it together and be there for me. I even asked if he was sure he wanted to keep the baby, given how much things has changed between when we started trying and now. He said he was so sorry for getting too wrapped up in what was going on with him, he definitely wanted to keep the baby, and he was so grateful
I shared with him and he would step up. 

While I could see him trying (taking over dinners and cleaning), he was still struggling a lot. He said that he was okay to go back to doing preschool pick up and drop off so I could rest and do prenatal yoga before work. He said our previously convo about boundaries helped and he was managing it okay. He was suffering from extended sleep deprivation from insomnia and still felt very withdrawn to me. Instead of feeling like the most exciting time, as pregnancy felt last time and I was expecting it would be this time, I continued to feel alone and like his journey and mental health were not allowing space for the pregnancy.  

6 weeks ago we were talking about the potential of switching schools. While our kiddo remains very happy at school, we have been concerned about staffing ratios and not having a director for so long. During that conversation it became clear that he was still overly enmeshed with the school, it falling apart was really affecting him, and the idea of leaving it was also freaking him out bad. That convo got deep, and I said while it was natural for him to be overly enmeshed, given his background, he needs to let go a bit. In that convo he disclosed that he had been struggling with boundaries with the same lead teacher from our last convo. After I asked what happened, he said had bought her a book using his previously deactivated Amazon account and given it to her while I was on a work trip. 

The truth about this came out in a trickle. He now says that this teacher has a hot and cold way about her that reminded him of his mom and triggered his childhood trauma. He had became kind of obsessed with his interactions with her, reading into any curt interactions as judgement of him as a father. He claims his trauma had him essentially fauning, to keep him feeling safe. He has also described his mental health since the ADHD diagnosis process as a psychotic break. He said he has been experiencing “distortions in reality” during this time, feeling like when he had any good interaction he felt so at peace and one with the universe and she had been brought into our lives to help him find peace and connection but any curt interaction would have been teetering on the edge of self harm and spinning out. He sometimes thought that they were cosmically brought together to be friends and learn important lessons about the universe. He would also hallucinate her voice in his head telling him he was worthless, etc.  He describes his id or self identity as “dissolving” and loosing his sense of self. He says he feels like all the trauma in his body was rearranged and now clasped like a tight fist. I definitely consider this an emotional affair, and my inclination is to leave him. 

He says he is extremely sorry and can’t believe he did this. He cannot explain why he did it, saying that when he thinks back on it he doesn’t understand why he did it. It’s like watching a movie of someone else doing it. The experiences of “distortions of reality” have worsened as he tries to process what he did. He is horrified and dismayed and frankly terrified of his behavior and what’s happening to him. He has now met with three psychologists and his psychiatrist, who have all suggested it was an episode of hypomania and likely indicates bipolar disorder. They think the stress of the ADHD diagnosis, school falling apart, and the pregnancy triggered the episode. He tried Seroquel and almost immediately experienced severe suicidal ideation. He is now trying ambilify as of tonight. We have agreed we need to move my kiddo to a different school, but almost none have openings this time of year and my kiddo will be absolutely devastated. 

My husband now thinks it’s possible his dad had bipolar disorder-his dad mentioned it (but also claimed to have many issues as an excuse for his emotional abuse and substance use). My husband did have other experience about 20 years ago where he felt his id was dissolving and he had similar distortions in reality-it was when he was 20, had moved out of his violent and chaotic family home, and was processing the extent of the abuse he survived for the first time. 

He has only lied to me once before, 5 years ago. He had smoked pot and I asked him about it and he lied and said he hadn’t. I smelled it on him and called him out. We ended up talking for hours after, I said that lying about using drugs is a sign of addiction and I would not tolerate any lies or drugs moving forward, especially given his family history. I used to smoke frequently, he did on occasion before this incident. He has not used pot since and very infrequently drinks alcohol. 

I am absolutely terrified of what comes next. We have built such an incredible life together and have a wonderful family and prestigious and meaningful careers. I am standing by him for now while he tries to recover. But I’m absolutely terrified for our future. Will I get my husband back? Will I have to raise these kids on my own (and with 1 salary in the highest cost of living area in the country)? Does this episode mean this is a new late onset condition, and this will be the first of many hypomanic episodes to come? Or is it possible the crisis in his 20s was the first hypomanic episode and we could have 20 years before experiencing another one? How will we manage a newborn and a toddler (and my recovery from the repeat c-section I may need) if he’s still in crisis or even freshly in a delicate recovery? Will my kids develop bipolar disorder? ";r/BipolarSOs;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1oeyjr6/terrified_of_suspected_bipolar_in_so/
2025-10-24 19:21:06;Could this be bipolar II? I’m self-aware but confused — seeking insight from those diagnosed;"Hi everyone. I’m not here to self-diagnose — I know that only a professional can do that. But I’ve been living in emotional cycles that feel intense, confusing, and hard to explain. I recently did a self-check and matched several symptoms of bipolar II. I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve been diagnosed: do these patterns sound familiar to you?

Here’s what I’ve been experiencing:

Hypomanic-like symptoms (lasting several days):

• I feel euphoric, extremely confident, and sometimes superior — people have pointed this out.
• I get very irritable or edgy. One day I’m warm and calm, the next I snap or shut down.
• I’m talkative and expressive one day, then withdrawn and silent the next. I detach from people I deeply care about.
• My thoughts race and jump quickly. I hyperfixate on hobbies, people, or self-improvement.
• I get distracted easily and forget things fast.
• I have bursts of energy to start projects, businesses, workouts — then lose interest completely.
• I make impulsive decisions, especially with money, and feel immense guilt afterward.
• I obsess over how others perceive me, trying to meet expectations — then swing to “I don’t care,” only to care again.


Depressive-like symptoms (lasting weeks):

• I feel deep sadness and emotional numbness.
• I lose interest in things I usually love — cooking, singing, art, music.
• I feel fatigued and low-energy, and people assume I’m just lazy.
• My appetite shifts drastically. I gain weight whether I eat a lot or barely eat. My body image haunts me.
• I snap at people even when they’ve done nothing wrong, then feel guilty but don’t know how to fix it.


I could go on, but I’ll stop here. I’m very self-aware, and that makes me scared I’m just overreacting. I don’t have money for a consultation, and I can’t tell my parents — they don’t believe in mental health support and see it as weakness.

Disclaimer: I’m not asking for a diagnosis. I’m asking for insight from those who’ve been diagnosed with bipolar II. Do these symptoms sound familiar to you? Did you feel this confused before getting clarity?

2025-10-24 18:01:21;Coming to terms with a bipolar diagnosis;"Hi, I’m 39F recently diagnosed with bipolar 1 in the middle of a manic episode. I can see now it was building for months, I was sleeping less, talking faster, taking on too much, feeling completely alive and miserable at the same time.

By June, things had spiralled. I had a similar situation last year that also involved psychosis where I was convinced my wife was somehow dangerous to me. This year, it happened again. I started seeing patterns everywhere, connecting dots that proved she was lying to me, manipulating things around me. She kept denying everything I bought up, but I just knew she was lying even though I couldn’t find the evidence I needed. Deep down I knew she loved me, but I also believed she was deceiving me. 

When I got the diagnosis, part of me was relieved. It felt like my whole life suddenly made sense. I began to feel deep shame about the things I had said and done in the past that I now realise was bipolar. It felt like I had an illness that made me someone completely different to who I think I am. For a week I took the meds they prescribed and agreed to go to hospital, but I changed my mind. It felt like everyone, especially my wife, was overreacting. The meds flattened me, so I stopped after a week and just went back to the tiny sleep dose of the antipsychotic I’d been on before.

A week later, after another big argument, I left our home and sent an email ending my marriage. I know that sounds cold, but I felt like I had to. She’s written once or twice since saying she’s confused and in pain, and loves me and hopes we can reconcile, but she’s moved out now. I haven’t seen or spoken to her since that email. Is that strange? I can’t seem to do it. I don’t trust her. 

The thing that confuses me most is how deeply I loved her. I really believed she was my soulmate. Now I look back and I’m not sure what was real. I catch myself thinking maybe it was all a lie, that she was pretending, that I was somehow conned. I think she lied about so many things. But then I’ll see or remember something that reminds me how safe I used to feel with her, and I can’t reconcile those two realities.

I’ve started a new job and on the surface I’m functioning fine. I haven’t talked to many people about what happened because I don’t know who to trust or what version of the story to tell. The paranoia hasn’t totally gone away.

I think I accept the diagnosis now. But I don’t know what that means for everything I’ve done. Was ending my marriage right? How do you even begin to tell the difference?

Has anyone else looked back after an episode and not known what parts of their life were real? How did you learn to trust your own memories again?";r/bipolar;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oetoce/coming_to_terms_with_a_bipolar_diagnosis/

I have had extreme fatigue & anxiety for the last two years & it was all chalked up to be my bipolar showing its ugly head. My psychiatrist & I were convinced I was becoming treatment resistant because nothing was helping. Turns out, I have hyperthyroidism which is causing all the symptoms I’ve been having. I genuinely thought for the rest of my life I was going to be unmanageably tired & anxiety ridden. I was starting to believe I was even narcoleptic. But we have real answers now & I can get the treatment I actually need. I’m so tired of cycling through medication for bipolar & it never changed anything for me. I’m on a stimulant (modafinil) because I could not stay awake but hyperthyroidism explains everything I’ve been experiencing. I’m currently on lamotrigine (200mg) and latuda (60mg) plus hydroxyzine, I just tapered off pristiq with the help of Prozac. We had considered going on Effexor but I was hesitant because pristiq was so hard for me to get off of. I don’t think I’ll try Effexor yet until I get my thyroid under control. I have a high resistance to a lot of mental health medications so our options were becoming very limited. I cried I was so relieved. I really thought I was going to live the rest of my life being tired & anxious. I cannot wait to live a normalish life again where I don’t sleep for 72 hours & still feel exhausted.

I’m not saying crazy as in crazy cause by my bp, I knew something else was wrong but I was dismissed by healthcare professionals for so long that it was JUST my bp. I see a psychiatrist & my therapist weekly because I’m so treatment resistant without the hyperthyroidism. I’ve been battling my brain since I was 5.

2025-10-24 13:10:17;Can person in mania stop it with mindfulness?;"My husband (bipolar 1) just had his first major manic episode in July-August and was diagnosed with bipolar. Nearly 2 months later, he is in a relapse. He is on medication (300mg seroquel) this time, and he says he feels like his thoughts are increasingly pulling him in a delusional direction over the past 7 days (spiritual significance, prophecy) and it would feel like a warm hug to give in, but he knows it’s mania. We’ve contacted his psychiatrist but the psychiatrist recommended he stay at his current dose for now since he just tirated up to 300mg. My husband says he feels like he can stop the delusional thoughts with mindfulness, but he’s worried that eventually the mania will build up and he’ll tip over the edge into the delusions and not want to take medication. Should we go to the ER? Will the mindfulness/self-awareness work? Does anyone have experience with this territory?

ETA: since last night, he said he feels slightly improved today. his plan is to get a local private doctor wherever has the soonest appointment and give them his psychiatrist’s letter so they can prescribe blood tests and lithium (we are in a different country from his psychiatrist right now, so the psychiatrist prescription doesn’t work here). But he feels activated/triggered by talking to me about it and doesn’t want me involved in his psychiatric decisionmaking and says that he feels his autonomy is the most important thing right now.

I’m (F/30/suspecting BP2)

I went to get evaluated for my mental health a couple of years ago and got referred back to my doctor GP for treatment.

The psychiatrist noted possible BP2.

It’s not overly explosive, impulsive, risky or destructive.

It’s just quiet, with waves of depression and okay moods. 

I’m incredibly self-aware and always monitoring myself.

Sometimes I binge-eat, binge-indulge in things in excess.

Ruin my credit or drain my bank accounts for useless shit.

Have difficulty just existing sometimes.

Other times I have loads of ideas on how to help myself.

They constantly tell me it’s BPD. My therapist of 5-6 years doesn’t see it at all, she sees mood, anxiety, attachment, trauma, coping mechanisms and defensive issues, maybe other things than my ADHD.

My ADHD medication helps level me out.

I’m trying some mood and anxiety medications.

I feel so misunderstood, unsean, unstable and stressed out trying to understand myself.

I’ve had to drop out of university due to a severe depressive episodes. The bad days feel like they’re never going to end and the good days will never start. My only happy times were in mania during imminent brain damage. I don’t understand how I have to live like this for the rest of my life when it feels like a death sentence. During teen years I was in and out of treatment even living in the hospital for 7 months. I get severe ptsd dreams about inpatient almost every night I can never imagine going back it was so traumatic it revisits me every night. I know the median age is a lot lower and I wonder myself if I will be one of those who die early. I cannot imagine living the rest of my life in such pain. I’ve been medicated for a long time and it just feels like never ending pain. I stopped smoking weed it was making me more depressed. Not sure where I’ll go in life followed by this pain the rest of my life. I have a girlfriend I’m in love with I want kids with her but I can’t stop imagining subjecting my children to the illness or subjecting them to their mother killing herself. I just don’t know how possibly for the rest of my life I’m supposed to have everyday happen. It feels never- ending and I don’t understand how it will ever get better. When it gets better it will inevitably fall again. I will never find true happiness outside of mania. I’m not sure how I’ve even been alive this far and how much longer I will be. I find solace in the concept of blackness when I die. I yearn for just a lack of pain, I wish almost everyday I was aborted. That’s my story.

2025-10-24 09:13:53;Questioning Moods;"I am certain this has been broached a million times, but I love y'all...I know you'll give me some grace. You've been so supportive. I was newly diagnosed as bipolar 2 a month ago. I have been on a combo of meds for a solid week. At first it honestly did the trick. I was stable. Getting good sleep. More clarity. But today I was on my nightly walk, and I thought to myself ""I feel good""...which then led me to think, ""oh shit...am I manic!?"". 

Also today has been like a battle in my brain with horrible miserable thoughts. Like depression is trying to get in, but just can't quite get through the door. Anyone second guessing moods on meds? I did a lot of bad things in my last manic phase, and hurt someone I love very much. I would give anything to never have a manic phase again. I hate them.

2025-10-24 08:47:10;I Think I’M IN TROUBLE;"I’ve had three prior attempts. The last one, I was really lucky someone found me.  That was in 2020.  Looking back, I was a mess back then. Undiagnosed, being treated with SSRIs for MDD, my life was a wreck. 

I finally was diagnosed with BP1, heavy on the mania and prone to psychosis. I did the medication roulette until I found a combination that was working.  It’s been tweaked over the last few years, and I do all the things - therapy twice a month, weekly DBSA meetings, monthly psychiatric appointments, try to sleep regularly, religious about my medications. I’m doing all the things.

But. My life is a train wreck. I have no money left, I’m unemployable, I’m waiting on SSA to determine whether I’m ill enough to be helped. I had a professional career, but that is in shambles - my professional community is small and no one wants to hire someone with BP1. I’m on the verge of losing my house, my car.

Fuck usually I’m the guy telling people to hang in there.  But this is what is scaring me the most. In my prior attempts, I was manic, out of my mind.  

But now, fuck I just want to be done with this.  I’m tired of living with Bipolar Disorder. I’m tired of not being able to get a job, let alone hold onto one. I’m tired of waiting for some bullshit government hack deciding whether I should be granted the privilege of receiving benefits that will keep me poor for my remaining days.

Honestly, I think I’m at the end of my rope. The fucked up thing is, I’m not manic right now, I’m not depressed, I’m just… done. I’m tired of living. It’s the best way I can explain it.

2025-10-24 07:45:53;Unsure about diagnosis;"Hi everyone,

I was recently diagnosed with F31.32, which is code for Bipolar 2 with current depressive state on the DSM. I have been in therapy for 4 years; my current therapist for 6 months after a move. I don’t know if I really do have this or if it’s something else.

She wrote that i display some manic/mixed symptoms and sleep disturbances. I can see these being true, but also don’t know if it’s really the case. I just have always felt my mood changes are too fast and assumed it was more of a BPD/Cluster B shoot off than bipolar. 

I have tried antidepressants - I take lexapro which helped with my anxiety but did nothing for my mood symptoms. I am on Caplyta which is an atypical antipsychotic, which seems to help prevent the depression from getting too low for a while, but hasn’t been as effective as usual lately.

I do get depressed. Especially around my
period cycle. That’s when it is at its worst. I don’t feel I really get manic, but from what I’ve read maybe just “seeming better” and out of a depressive state is enough to be considered hypomania. I’m not sure. I definitely have phases where I have a harder time falling alseep and have more social energy and do more impulsive things like hookups and appearance changes.

I’m really not sure if this is the proper diagnosis tho. I guess i’m scared of assuming it’s one thing while it’s actually another, in case the treatment is wrong. Like what if it’s actually ADHD and I just need adderall? Idk.. people of reddit pls help

2025-10-24 05:43:47;My ex-partner with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 thinks I betrayed her, and I don't know how to continue dealing with this.;"Hello everyone.
I want to share my story because I no longer know how to handle the situation and I feel like I need to vent with people who can understand what it is like to live with someone who has type 1 bipolarity. We are both women 

I was in a relationship for four years with a person diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1. It was a relationship with a lot of love, but also with a lot of wear and tear. She was never unfaithful, but she was very jealous.
He didn't like me sharing with other people, especially men, and every time I did, scenes of jealousy or intense arguments broke out.
She said that jealousy was something “healthy” because it meant that she loved me, but over time it began to suffocate me.

I have a lifelong friend, I have known him since I was 14 and now I am 21. He was always someone important to me.
She never could stand him, she couldn't understand why he was so close, and she began to impose herself a lot on that topic. I asked him several times to stop making jealous scenes about him, because he was really just my friend and in the town where I live I no longer had any friends or anyone with whom I could go out or talk. 

We argued many times about this.
He even told me that if I kept talking to him, he was going to break up with me.
Still, I tried to stand my ground, because I felt like I wasn't doing anything wrong.
Over time, when the situation was already very tense, I tried to talk about it from another place, reflect, and I apologized if I had made her feel bad in any way. But instead of calming down, she started to get angrier at me.

It got to the point where I blocked my friend from social media, and when he asked me why I did it, I told him that he is my friend but that I love her and I don't want to lose her. He told me that he didn't know, that it seemed “strange and made him doubt that something had happened with my friend.”
From there everything went downhill: I cried, asked for forgiveness, tried to fix things, but she became more and more distant and annoying, until she finally broke up with me.

After that, we continued to have contact.
Sometimes I am the one who looks for it, because it is difficult for me to let go of everything we experience.
When we see each other, I notice that there is still something between us: her eyes change, looks of love escape her, and she still asks me things about my life, about my exes, she even seems jealous.
However, he also remains firm in his decision, as if fighting internally between what he feels and what his mind tells him.

I feel that she is not well, that she may be going through a bipolar crisis, although she says she is “regulated” with the medications.
For my part, I am emotionally exhausted, because it hurts me that she thinks I betrayed her with my friend when that was never the case. I admit that there were also times when I treated her badly due to emotional exhaustion since she never took her medications seriously. When I finished, I blamed myself for betrayal and bad treatment. And she tells me that it was very difficult for her to accept that she was bipolar and that was why it was difficult for her to take the pills and I still mistreated her. When in reality I always wanted him to take his pills. Since there I saw that I was better and everything was flowing well. It's been 41 days since the term. We haven't stopped talking on WhatsApp even though she seems really cold and distant. 

I don't know if anyone has gone through something similar, but I would like to know what it's like to love someone who can't see reality clearly because of their illness.
How do you set limits while still worrying?
And how do you accept that someone you love so much sees you as the enemy?

2025-10-24 05:19:08;some positive bipolar representation on TV;"Video titled: DAVE | Season 1 Ep. 5: Gata Is Bipolar Highlight | FXX  /// There is some adult language, censored out. Not specifically promoting any platform, just this clip from a show.

Dave is a show about, and created by, David Andrew Burd AKA Lil Dicky- a parody rapper. Its a comedy with some drama, inspired by the real events of his life. GaTa is Lil Dicky's hype man irl, and actually does have bipolar. In this scene, he opens up about his diagnosis, the meds he has to take, and puts into words what his experience feels like. 

In this episode, we see GaTa's whole day and gives more context. I reccomend watching the whole episode (even if not the whole show, you can pick up context clues). From the beginning of his day to the point in this scene, the show does its best to illustrate what exactly is happening in his head - before explaining it. I think about it a lot, and cant find any single clip that shows it, so you'll just have to watch. Right before the start of the video, GaTa has a small episode from things just.. building up, as most of us might be able to relate. 

When GaTa is done talking, he is supported and reassured by everyone in the room. 

I think its a really beautiful moment, and its reassuring to like.. not only see and relate to the mood, not only see someone talking openly, but ALSO being supported. Its possible. The hope is there. Some depressing posts lately about the stigma, so lmk how y'all feel about the video.

TRANSCRIPT:

*GaTa: I'm fcking bipolar.*

*Dave: You're bipolar?* 

*GaTa: I have a chemical imbalance going on inside my brain.*

*Mike: GaTa, did a doctor diagnose you?*

*GaTa: Medicine and the whole nine. I take eight to ten pills every night, bro. Like, the other day, I felt myself ramping up. I took too much and it probably me up, man. Look at me, man.*

*Dave: It's much harder to stay mad at this point... *

*GaTa: It makes me feel like a rat in a hole sometimes. Like, I gotta express this to you, bro. Hot, cold. That's me. I never tell nobody this type of shit, bro. Never ever. Shit is embarrassing, bro. Like, I've been like this for a while.*

*Dave: We appreciate you sharing all this with us. Like, seriously, you can tell us any of this stuff.*

*GaTa: I love y'all, man. And you guys make me feel comfortable. You guys are weirdos, just like me, bro. This dude rap about having a small dick all the time. This dude right here rubs acne [cream] on his back, no problem. This dude back here dresses cool as fck. he knows all the hip hop urban lingo, but pronounces all his words properly. And I'm really bipolar, bruh. Like, really bipolar. Sometime I feel crazy and sometime I feel lazy.*

*Dave: And I appreciate that. And I think I speak for all of us when I say we're in this thing together, man. I love you, man. I really appreciate you. Like,*

*GaTa: I love you too, bro. You gotta know that. You feel me. I never would come here purposely trying to fck your shit up.*

*Mike: Well, GaTa, I'm really glad you told us. And I think it's pretty cool that we've got the first hype man that's clinically depressed.*

2025-10-24 04:49:40;I haven't left my house for 3 months now. i don't know what to do.;"So I have been suffering from mental health since a decade now. It was only last year that i was diagnosed with bipolar. Before that I was diagnosed with depression.

Sadly I am not close with my parents and they weren't present while growing up and they don't support me emotionally as a child. 

Back to bipolar, after the diagnosis I started medicine and started exercising. I started running and walking in nature. Did everything that was suggested. But now I have noticed is I am doing everything on my own. I recently fell of the wagon and I it was bad. This is nothing new but this time I am just so hopeless. I think I don't have the energy to try this again. I am so angry and suicidal at the same time. Luckily I have few good friend. But the problem is they do listen to my problem but none of them really try to understand my illness. I even asked one of my close friends and my cousin to attend my therapy so moral support but they didn't bother to give 1 hrs of their life. I have noticed although they care about me they don't really understand how badly it's affecting me. And mind you they knew about my illness since 7_8 years now. Also recently one of my friends ask me what do you want to do? And I am tried of planning and doing everything on my own. I have gone contactless for a year and still people around me doesn't bother to understand my illness. They do seem to care but they don't try to understand deeply. And I feel like I am doing too much and blaming myself. 

I am just done honestly. I did everything right but still I am stuck. I feel like I am glued to my bed. I don't think I can do this again and again. The people around me haven't done anything significant to help me. Mind you I come from a poor country with limited health services. And mental health is still a taboo subject. I don't know what to do. Every morning I wake up and I want to leave this world. I hate seeing myself like this because I have much to offer. Seeing yourself like this isn't cute.

2025-10-24 04:49:39;Was this a manic episode?;About a year ago, I went on a solo trip across Europe. I jumped around to different countries. I was so excited that I stopped eating most days, and was out partying with strangers most nights. I stayed with a random couple in Slovakia for several days, who I had just met. I literally felt like a god, that’s the only way I can describe it. I lost tons of weight and was completely sleep deprived and not eating.  I thought I was the most attractive and interesting person in the world. I left my partner of 3 years for someone I had just met on the plane when I got home, and basically somehow ruined my whole life in the span of a few weeks. When I realized what had happened, like really internalized it, I was completely and utterly devastated and was unable to manage my constant crippling sadness. I wanted to see if this resonates with anyone in this sub, and if I should go to a dr.

2025-10-24 02:53:25;People with bipolar partners, how do you manage?;"UPDATE: Good news: I found him this morning. Bad news: I found him as he was trying to kill himself and he’d been off his meds for the past 48 hours. Better news: We got him checked into the mental hospital where he’s getting the help he needs. He is safe and okay for the next two weeks, and I am considerably less worried about him, but I’m always going to be worried about him. He said I saved him today, and that is not something I take lightly but deeply appreciate (I don’t know if that’s the right phrasing). But for now he is where he needs to be, getting the help he so desperately needs. I will be checking in with him regularly during his stay to see how he’s doing. For all the kind people who took the time to read this post and offer advice, thank you very much💕💕

My partner is bipolar and has manic-depressive episodes with suicidal ideation, and sometimes disappears for hours (once he went missing for 3 days). I, being worried, called for a welfare check last night especially as he’d called me yesterday morning expressing that he was feeling suicidal and then I didn’t hear from him for the rest of the day. This led me to thinking the worst, and I started to spiral. I heard from him early this morning and he iterated that this is part of his condition, and that he’s also still trying to figure it out himself (he was only fairly recently properly diagnosed and put on the correct medication). I just worry about him a lot, and it breaks my heart to hear him wish he could just be normal.

That being said, one of my projects for school this week required me to take a quiz to assess my emotional intelligence, and I scored high on everything except self-regulation (my lowest score) and self-motivation (the next lowest score). I'm not exactly surprised, but it did confirm the idea that I really need to work on myself and learn new coping skills to handle these weaknesses. 
When I'm not on meds, I have extreme highs and lows. The highs are awesome from my manic perspective. Lows bring me to the edge of a cliff and whisper  In both  The problem is I lose a lot of self-control in both of those mental states.

2025-10-24 02:21:36;Views on psychoanalysis/psychodynamic therapy for bipolar?;"I've been seeing my therapist (with a PhD in clinical psychology) for nearly 3 years. At first things seemed to be fine, and my focus right now is to skill build. I already see a psychiatrist semi-regularly for med management, so I thought I'd add weekly therapy to improve my emotion regulation. Now I'm better in terms of being able to regulate my emotions by reducing vulnerability as said in DBT, do some CBT reframes, have solid more or less consistent self-care routines, and exercise self-compassion, and now I want to work on building assertiveness skills, especially in the workplace.

I come from an overall very supportive and loving family i feel. Yes my mom (who might have untreated illness) was sometimes volatile while under work stress. No, her coping skills weren't great, but I forgave her for that, because she's not inherently a bad person, and overall had ok habits (didn't drink, do drugs), and did what she thought was best, to raise me along with my dad raising me (who doesn't have any mental illness). Since retirement she's eased up anyway.

Anyway, my therapist wants to psychoanalyze my childhood and my relationship to my parents then, to see why I'm a certain way now with dating and relationships, and I think that's kind of a slippery slope. She tried that on me one day in session, said my dad's ""passivity"" is the reason I go for emotionally unavailable mean men, and I felt leaving very triggered and depressed. I didn't eat well for the next few days, and didn't do my work required of me for grad school. My dad is not a mean man. He's very kind (and others in our family and people he works with have said so too), so this kind of created a lot of confusion in me.

It seemed like a stretch to make that claim, imho, based on one data point/anecdote I gave as a child. it's not emblematic of my entire relationship with my parents.

So my question is: for people with bipolar diagnosis, does psychoanalysis or psychodynamic modality even work? Or maybe my therapist just doesn't know how to do it thoughtfully and carefully? I want to tell her that I'd rather not be psychoanalyzed as it seems ineffective for me...but I'm also a bit conflicted about it.

Any thoughts on the matter are appreciated.";r/BipolarReddit;3;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1oeax4j/views_on_psychoanalysispsychodynamic_therapy_for/

He was only *a live in SO* for a very short period. Only saw Hypomania it appears.

And the episode was started by, none other than… Adderall. (There was some coke usage, but let’s be real. Adderall started the episode, coke later didn’t help.)

When it ramped up, Kevin was at his house, she had the two boys in her house for visitation and she locked herself in the bathroom with the youngest boy, cops had to rip the baby from her and lock her to a stretcher. Her Mom and Dad know the diagnosis though and definitely kept it out of the public. (And it’s not their place to reveal it anyway)

The rest of it, 2010-2023 where her parents got her medicated made things much more stable, but there was a lot of ups and downs during that period that Kevin didn’t see, but her Dad told him “You only know 10% of it”

As the boys grew up they refused to see her. It was their choice. He didn’t believe their stories and was heartbroken they didn’t want to see her, until the boys showed him videos. :( So he respected their wishes. But was still sad. The boys are traumatized.

Every caretaker they had, Britney fired. And the first set was like family. Security, Nannies, etc. Some left on their own and one guy sued her for sexual harassment.

His notes about the conservatorship and the Free Britney movement destroyed everything. The children were harassed online and in public for not supporting their Mom. (It’s pretty horrific what these fans did)

He still believes the conservatorship was the best thing, and now that it’s over he truly worries about her. Truly. 

Her Dad, he still respects. They only bumped heads when visitation scheduling got wacky. Her Mom was quiet and kept peace but he respects that. And especially Jamie Lynn, she sent texts to him, that are in the book succinctly expressing empathy and support for the boys. 

Kevin - He worked pretty hard to get where he was dancing. From zero. No joke. But not an angel himself, he admits to partying like a rockstar. But his kids were his top priority, even over career. Turning down big offers for the kids. He didn’t get that much money from the divorce as people think, it’s all in there, considering he needed a full security team for the kids and feed them, school, etc. And he’s probably not making much from the book.

I sincerely believe that he published it, to set the record straight for the boys, himself, the family. And a cry for help for Britney, but unfortunately no one can reach her to help her now without getting sucked in. It’s up to her. :(

I only wish he had pushed for mental health awareness in it, but he wasn’t an SO for long enough and he didn’t have the info like we do here. It didn’t exist. 

That’s pretty much everything. Except for Kevin’s rise as a dancer, which is pretty incredible. He’s no joke, got on Michael Jackson’s team. And some other Britney dramatic outbursts like shredding the upholstery of two Mercedes with knives. Punching her Dad.

Last: This is only my speculation. While Britney was medicated through the conservatorship there were some ups and downs, she was always free to travel and do things. Totally normal. So I suspect any episodes or outlandish things that happened during that time may have been fueled by other stuff she could get outside (Adderall, coke, etc)

And I do believe that the pressures of stardom, paparazzi and tabloids was traumatizing for her. That only added to her hurricane. But her parents only stepped in until the episode put the kids and her in danger.

I feel sad for her. Lots of empathy and the family. Hope she gets well. ♥️

2025-10-24 01:00:51;Your favourite hypomania management tips (+ maybe some reassurance?);"CW: very brief references to past drug (ab)use, not detailed or graphic at all!

Hey everyone! Sorry in advance if this post is verbose, as you can probably tell by the title I’m currently hypomanic and I am already a very wordy person naturally haha

Context: I got dxed with BP1 almost exactly one year ago after a severe two week manic episode with psychotic features. I’ve been told I’m a little young for a diagnosis (17 at the time, 18 currently) and it was my first and only (known) manic episode. Was triggered by being put on Prozac. After a psych hold, PHP, and some trial and error I got put on meds that have worked great! I’ve struggled a lot with depressive episodes for the last year and have issues with impulse control and mood swings etc but I haven’t had a true episode of mania or hypomania since. 

Well, for my one year anniversary, my brain has decided to go hypomanic for the first time. I’m insanely talkative and social, high energy, full of racing thoughts and creativity, zero appetite, and I haven’t been able to sleep or eat whatsoever for three full days in a row. It feels like a stimulant high almost, except it’s lasting way longer. Okay. My two questions are:

A) How do you personally manage your hypomania?

I’ve been trying hard to stay off drugs until it ends because they heavily exacerbated my initial episode but the impulse is strong. I’ve been writing a lot of poetry, drawing, doing D&D session planning, complex makeup, I impulsively dyed and cut my hair, I’m taking my meds, I’m staying very safe all things considered…but I still can’t seem to eat or sleep at all and even though I can’t feel the physical toll of it YET I know I will the second I come down. I’m also getting bored and agitated quickly and I’m quickly running out of things to do.

How do you get to sleep? How do you eat a meal? How do you interact with other people normally? What do you do with all of this extra energy? It’s so weird to be aware of your mania because the last time I was manic I was way too far gone to even properly figure out there WAS a problem even as I was actively fucking up my life. But this time I know I’m hypomanic and I’d like to stay safe despite the impulse to do something risky or dangerous. 

B) Am I going to “go crazy” again?

I know this might be a silly one, but I’m really feeling this nervousness in the back of my mind that if I do something wrong or don’t sleep or whatever that it’ll turn into what it was last time even though this time feels so much more manageable and comparatively very minor and I have safeguards in place. I just put myself in so many awful situations and did things and experienced things that permanently altered my life and brain and I went insane. I was unrecognisable within just a couple of days, no sense of danger or any consequence, intense religious psychosis heightened by hard drugs…I really don’t want to become that person again.

I have a sweet lovely boyfriend, I actually kind of like my new school, I’m managing my autism and ADHD so much better, I feel like I’ve just recently regained some semblance of control over my life and all my comorbid conditions and I really REALLY don’t want to land back in treatment and build my life back up from square one especially as a newly legal adult. I will of course be speaking to my therapist about this but I don’t know anyone else who’s bipolar in real life so I’m reaching out here. Could someone give me a bit of advice? Thanks so much! ♥️";r/bipolar;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oe8rtc/your_favourite_hypomania_management_tips_maybe/

2025-10-24 00:15:04;for those on lithium, how do you keep your electrolytes balanced?;"I don't do vigorous exercise. I do 5-15 mins yoga a day and go hiking on average for 45 mins once a month.   
I drink water throughout the day. In the summer months I drink gatorade and sometimes liquid IV. 

Before I started taking lithium 5 years ago, I was already kind of on a low sodium diet and my doc told me not to change it since my body was used to it. I feel weird when I eat a lot of salt. But I am not formally diagnosed with anything that requires a low sodium diet, I just listen to my body. That being said, I eat potato chips everyday, and salad dressing, and other foods, I do not go without sodium.

The first two summers of me taking lithium, one night I woke up with a slow heart rate, it was like 41 or something, and I felt like I was dying. I had cold sweats and felt horrible, I can't even describe it. The first time I went to the ER. Once they hit me with the saline solution I felt completely better. After that I was like alright I gotta be smarter about liquids, sodium, electrolytes. They never told me what it was.  
The second time it happened I went to the kitchen and liked salt off my hand and drank a ton of water and I felt better. 

I feel like things were going to for a while, until recently.   
I was drinking lots of water at work, and at home, and always have water on the go. I was drinking gatorade on hot days, I didn't change my diet.  
On Tuesday I had the feeling that if I did not eat broth, I was going to die (that's dramatic.) I felt sick and weak but not as bad or the same as the ER time.  
So I made broth and drank it and I felt way way way better. 

Do you have any problems like this  
What do you do

TLDR:  
Been on lihtium for 5 years. The first two, I was not paying attention to my liquid/salt intake and had consequences. The last three years I feel like I have been paying attention to it but I don't know how to keep my electrolytes in balance.

i feel so scared and stressed all the time. i live in constant fear that my family is depressed and someone may hurt themselves, or worse. my grandfather died because of depression (trying not to get too detailed) and i live in fear of something happening to my family. 

i’m so scared all the time and stressed that i think it’ll be so much easier if i just disappeared, so that i wont have to see my family suffer. 

my family suffers no more than anyone else. we have our screaming matches, fights, etc, but ive never been this scared before. it’s not even anything anyone said. i just can’t get the thought out of my head. i’m also so scared of saying this out loud, in case i accidentally speak it into the universe or the devil feeds off of my fears. 

i’ve also been so bored. either scared or bored. i went on the dream trip of my life and felt nothing. i am moving with my friends into a nice apartment and getting free tuition with my job and i feel nothing. i go to parties, trips, shopping, church, worship, concerts, etc and i dont feel any enjoyment. what is the point of this??

2025-10-23 21:37:34;New psychiatrist changing diagnosis;"Hello! 

I have been diagnosed bipolar since late 2020. I really love and trusted the provider who first encouraged me to start evaluating and accepting it. (Came to the doctor’s office for something completely different. Just so happened that I rode my dirt bike there in the snow.) I started medication and felt that I was really managing everything well. The medicine was working great.  
My insurance changed in 2024 and I was not able to continue seeing them or the psychologist who I had been working with. I decided to see a psychiatrist this time around. 
After just 10 minutes in the office where he continued to insist that my hormones were just off because I was pregnant (uhm… was not pregnant when diagnosed or ruining my life from 2015-2020!). He then suggested that I had schizoaffective disorder instead of bipolar disorder. I was really confused how he could jump from not believing me at all to that. Now I am second guessing everything and I can feel myself falling into my old habit of avoiding therapy/return visits. The reason I’m second guessing is because I believe in ghosts and have had experiences where I have seen what I believe to be spirits. Now I’m scared that this belief I’ve had my whole life was actually the schizoaffective disorder. 
I am still able to get my medicine through my regular doctor and it still seems to be working well. 
I don’t know what to do. My mood is regulated but feel like I’m doubting so much about life. 
I guess I just need someone to relate to or to give me (kind, please) advice.

2025-10-23 21:03:03;Stigma;"This is a lengthy post and i apologize in advance but its seriously impacting me and I want people to know if you feel like something is wrong push and advocate for yourself. Do not let health care providers dismiss you because of your illness. 
 Starting in December I went to the gym after 7 minutes i was like jello completely weak, I could not do anymore of my routine I had to go home. I have complained about fatigue since about 2020 and psych would say this is normal after manic episode to feel extremely exhausted, feeling like lead is normal for people like us apparently so every time it happened I brush it off.
Then on the 21st of April I am laying in bed watching tv with my SO and my vision starts flipping like a mirror image and then normal very rapidly, it feels like my eyes are very quickly moving back and fourth and i am so dizzy. My so tells me just try and relax he thinks i am having some kind of panic attack. To be fair i was at this point as i was scared. 
May 13th i am in my garden SO is at work i call my dad to take me to er, they tell me this is 100% from my bipolar and send me on my way with some anxiety pills. 
A week later I am at work and I am doing a morning tour and my right hip hurts and all of the sudden my entire leg hip to foot numb i cant feel it. This last a couple hours and goes away. I make a GP appointment. 
She blamed my bipolar. A week later i go to urgent care because i cant speak normal and it feels like someone is choking me, they are in the hall outside my door laughing about how they can guess why i am there and make jokes about my mental heath as they come in the room, they literally do not even do a physical and tell me i have some tonsil cyst. And write me a prescription. 
Arms start going numb regularly to the point of crying because it hurts, Feels like someone is pushing just under my ribs from the inside out. If i have to go to the restroom i need to go the moment i get the sensation. I make another attempt with GP but yell at her to listen to me, and every time she interrupts me i tell her to shut up and let me finish i came prepared with notes and finally i get a referral to a neurosurgeon who does not judge me just listens to me orders mri and a emg and guess what this is not psychosomatic there is a neurological condition affecting all of these issues they are all related. I am in a danger zone of this being in a progressive stage because no one has listened to me and dismissed all of my concerns time after time due to bipolar 1 diagnosis.

2025-10-23 20:12:58;Stigma and people being afraid of you. How do you manage?;"**[TW: talk of medical discrimination and stigma against Bipolar disorder]**


I‘m just recently diagnosed and I wanted to talk about this new diagnosis with a few friends because I needed to process it all. It’s a huge shock and my feelings about it are all over the place. 

I noticed that a bunch of people reacted very weirdly when I send the text to the group chat. 
The main reaction seemed to be apprehension. People where happy for me that I finally got diagnosed and get treatment, but they where also worried. 
I‘ve had someone actually ask „what does that mean? Are you going to be psychotic?“

Even if people like me and want to support me there seems to be this stigma around bipolar disorder where people think I will definitely harm them. 

I have autism, adhd and cPTSD too and nobody reacted to those diagnoses the same way. With them it was always encouragement, celebration, welcoming me into the neurodivergent community. 
Even tho I have definitively hurt people due to forgetting stuff because of my adhd or getting physically defensive during ptsd flashbacks. 
People seem to give me grace and understanding for that, but with bipolar I am suddenly scary. 

From what I have seen Bipolar disorder falls into the realm of neurodivergence too, but nobody seems to want me there. 

I work in the medical field and there are so many people who believe bipolar = dangerous or bipolar = full time inpatient psych care forever. 
The amount of times I have been told shit like „patient x is Bipolar, be careful around them“ or „x patient is Bipolar, they are delusional don’t believe anything they say“. 

It’s honestly horrible. I‘ve even met someone who fully believed that all bipolar people want to actually m*rder others. Like wtf. 

How do you deal with the amount of stigma and misinformation going around? I am honestly considering hiding this diagnosis because I don’t want to be labeled as „the crazy one“. ";r/bipolar;6;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oe1md9/stigma_and_people_being_afraid_of_you_how_do_you/

What makes it worse is that I have a 10-year-old and can barely support her.

I have a new job but it barely makes ends meet. I live well below my country's poverty line. My meds made me gain over half my weight in the course of 2 years and I've struggled to shake it off since. I feel like I am worse off than I was when I graduated Uni back when I was 21. My body is always aching, I am always tired, and my mind feels like pudding. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make it better. I feel so alone. Like I'm always reliving my trauma.

I feel like a prisoner. The one friend I have that's been my safety net for years isn't as accessible as he used to be. He's still just as supportive, I just don't have the constant access I had to him back in Uni.

Switched psychiatrists about 3 times before finding the right one who accurately diagnosed me with adhd but, regardless of methylphenidate actually helping, some things were still off and beyond ADHD. Then he recommended a neuro-cognitive evaluation, which is pretty thorough and goes in depth. 

It took a few appointments with different specialists and about a month, so on Monday i had an appointment to receive feedback plus the actual diagnosis, and that’s when it was confirmed.

All these years fighting for a diagnosis, hoping someone would believe i feel as down as i swear i do, being pissed at doctors and therapists for saying “oh but if you were bipolar you’d be much more erratic and whatnot”, feeling like i was so fucked up there wasn’t even a name for it… AND WHEN I DO GET DIAGNOSED, it feels like a death sentence

For the past 3 days i’ve been useless like actually crying and avoiding reality because i did want a diagnosis and i was sure it was bipolar before adhd was confirmed, which made me go “thank god it’s not bd”. And then i still was unstable just not as much. Like it made perfect sense and i was so sure

Yet it did feel like a death sentence because i can’t help but think it’s gonna make things excruciatingly difficult for the rest of my life. And adhd too????? Like bro what 😭 idk i’m just devastated i never thought it’d hit me this hard

Mostly because my ex had both. Bd type 2 and adhd and i know what treatment for both of them should be like, but that can only happen if you’re able to afford it and i cant. I havent been able to work in months so um????

Anyway it’s just too much i just want the year to end and i’m honestly so fucking pissed at my own brain !!! for being the way it is, and also idk i was hoping it wouldnt be bipolar but it is and adhd yeah thats alright youre “normal” but i know how people look at you when you’re bipolar

2025-10-23 10:32:03;Returning to work;"My psych and company doctor gave me the permission to go back to work. Time for a little celebration! It was my 6th medical leave since this whole story started 5 years ago. First misdiagnosed as recurring MDD and 6 months ago diagnosed with BP2. I’ve gone through another med change this time (upped Lamictal from 100 mg to 300 mg, Effexor from 37.5 to 75 mg). Hope it will stabilise me. And next month, as a TCK, I’m moving from my passport country to my home country which I hope will give me more stability. I hated my life in my passport company which I think is the main trigger to my depressions.

2025-10-23 10:00:12;Why am I so sensitive?;"Ever since I was diagnosed about 4 years ago, I feel like I’m more sensitive or easily triggered. I’ve been working with my doctor to find the right combination of medication that works for me. Even so, I still have bad days where something happens and I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. 
An example: Today I was in a mood and didn’t want to go to work. I talked myself down and was able to start my day. A customer got rude with me for just trying to do my job and that’s when I began crying uncontrollably, over something I feel a normal person would’ve just move on from. After talking with a trusted coworker and a few hours later, I was fine. Like it didn’t even happen. It’s embarrassing when my coworkers see me in that state. Some days I just feel like work is overwhelming, tasks are daunting, and I don’t perform up to management standards. 
I’m frustrated with myself because I feel like I’m struggling to function the way I’m supposed to. I’ve talked with a therapist on what to do when I get worked up, but it’s still hard to calm me down. Sorry for the long post. I just feel like not many people in my circle understand. I need to know if others have similar experiences. ";r/bipolar;7;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1odr4zw/why_am_i_so_sensitive/
2025-10-23 09:48:55;AMA Stable, BP1 partner;"I've been a regular on this sub for 1+ year now and have noticed there are a lot of newbies in the sub due to the season change triggering mania in BP folks. So I figured I'd do an AMA for those of you who are curious about different things that come along with being bipolar. I'm hyper self aware (both fortunately and unfortunately) and have spent a lot of time these past two years digging into what bipolar really is.

Some info about me: I'm 33, mom of two small kids, been with my partner for going on 6 years now. I've been episode free since June 2024. I imploded my life in a opiate/grief fueled manic episode in 2016 with my ex husband (who was also BP). I was inv hospitalized in 2016 for 3 days. Became delusional and thought I was going to be whisked away by some rich man. I knew no rich men.

I struggled for a long time with spending, hypersexuality and rage. Around the age of 25-26, I began to realize I was the one fucking up my life, no one else. I'm diagnosed BP1, PTSD and GAD. I was dx in October of 2023. Started medication and other than one time to ""test"" if I was bipolar have taken it religiously.

My SO and I have a pretty good relationship and outside of normal relationship issues, we have managed to get this disorder under control as best as we can. We have game plans thought out. We have emergency plans in case things go sideways. We've both adjusted our life to this disorder.

So ask away. I'm an open book.";r/BipolarSOs;12;17;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1odqwtn/ama_stable_bp1_partner/
2025-10-23 09:22:23;Effective therapy to cope with depression?;"I’m 34f with bp2. I’ve been in counseling for over ten years, but only diagnosed bp2 within the past year or two. 

Regardless, today I was talking to my therapist (we’ve only had a few sessions together) about the awful depression-manic cycle I am in. I just came out of a rough depressed couple of weeks that took a lot out of me. 

As I talked about it, I had deja vu. I’ve been dealing with this cycle for as long as I can remember and nothing seems to help. And when I have talked to my therapists about it over the years, they seem stumped. Today especially it’s like she didn’t know what to say to me when I explained how bad my depression is. It’s frustrating. My PCP has been helpful in getting me diagnosed and figuring out my meds, but as far as coping, I feel like I’m getting worse with age! 

These past two weeks were awful, my house was messy, I was behind at work, exhausted all the time, crying (and I rarely cry on my meds), I didn’t shower for 3 days (which for me is like a big deal! I usually always shower once a day)

I’m trying to implement healthy habits now that I feel good (going to bed early, going to the gym, etc.) but I know inevitably the cycle is going to start again.

2025-10-23 05:21:20;My Doctor is thinking about diagnosing me with Bipolar disorder;"I was diagnosed with depression at 15 after a year-long “depressive episode” where I stopped going to school and missed a grade. Eventually, I forced myself to start doing things again, not because I wanted to, but because I’d rather hate life and be productive than hate life and do nothing. I’m 19 now.

I took antidepressants for about a year but quit because they didn’t help and caused bad side effects. I got tired of trying new meds, raising doses, then tapering off when they failed. Since then, I’ve mostly managed on my own, but lately it’s been harder. My suicidal thoughts have become stronger, so my parents made me see a doctor, which I appreciate.

My doctor prescribed an SSNRI this time, since the last 4 SSRIs didn’t help. I’ve been on it for two months but am now tapering off again. I mentioned that my aunt might have bipolar or BPD, and now my doctor thinks I could be bipolar too. I started mood stabilizers, but they just make me feel weird and raise my heart rate over 100 bpm. Two ECGs were fine, but it’s still uncomfortable.

I don’t think I’m bipolar though. I don’t have mood swings or manic episodes, just steady depression for about four years. My doctor said I have “no reason to be sad,” and maybe that’s true. I have a good home and life isn’t terrible, I just don’t enjoy it. I don’t believe it’s a simple “chemical imbalance” either. Something’s off, but bipolar doesn’t explain it.

I’m trying to work with doctors because I want to understand what’s wrong. College has been hard, and I want to finish my engineering degree. A diagnosis might help me get proper support. I’ve wondered if ADHD could be part of it, but I don’t want to self-diagnose. I mentioned it once before and it was brushed off, but maybe I should ask again.

Thanks for reading. I’d like to hear if anyone’s gone through something similar. Maybe my doctor’s right and I really am bipolar, but I’m not convinced yet.";r/bipolar;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1odkxjp/my_doctor_is_thinking_about_diagnosing_me_with/
2025-10-23 04:32:35;Depression or Real Love;"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 for almost a decade now and have always had trouble remembering or even wanting to take my meds. I also have adhd so I take Abilify, bupropion, and something for sleep ( a new med). I havent been taking my meds religiously for the last 3 months resulting in a depression. I just don't feel anything at the moment. Maybe flairs of happiness but im not sad or content just nothing. Im managing at work but recently got in trouble for using too much sick time. 

The point of this post stems from my relationship with my (29f) partner also (29f). We met a year ago online and have been dating since January of this year. They also have bipolar and take meds. Lately, I havent been feeling in love like I told them in May. We've gone out still and hang at least once a week but I no longer put in effort to be with them. I havent planned dates in awhile or even feel the need or wa t to be sensually active in the last month and a half.

This is only my 2nd relationship ever with my 1st ending last year only after 4 months. I've also never broken up with anyone before and I really dont want to hurt feelings but I just feel mothing at the moment. My therapist advised me not to make any hasty decisions until im fully on my meds. 

At the moment I do not feel the need to ever have a relationship and cant picture a future with anyone. I feel like if I end this relationship I would never go for one again because of this happening. 

So is it depression or am I just not in love only after a few months?

hi all. i was diagnosed with bp II last august 2024 and have been taking medication since then. however, from around october 2024 to december 2024, i skipped my medication LOTS of times due to school. i don't think we're allowed to name medications in posts right now, so i'm just going to say that my medication affects my sleep heavily, so i skipped it numerous times because i was a college student at the time who had to stay awake for several days just to finish schoolwork and study for exams. i noticed that on the days where i'd skip my medication, i'd just be ""off"". like i'd say and feel things that i wouldn't have said or felt if i were on my meds. as if my thinking becomes impaired without the meds. i know that impaired judgement is a symptom of certain episodes, but i usually read about their effects on decision-making and actions/behavior and not really their effects on a person's perspectives and their words.

i also noticed that when i'd start taking the medication again, my body would take months to really adjust to it. i noticed that during the months where my body was adjusting, i'd also be off. like there would be times where i would be fine, then there are also days where i feel like my thinking becomes impaired again. but after several months (around 7 months) of taking my meds continuously, i think i've finally stopped experiencing it.

i don't know. i've just said A LOT of things that i regret during the days where i skipped my meds + time when i was adjusting to the meds and a part of me thinks it may be because of the bipolar, while another part of me is telling me that i just don't what to take accountability for/accept my words/actions.";r/bipolar;4;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1odgiic/do_any_of_you_also_become_off_or_just_think_in/
2025-10-23 01:43:51;Psychosis flashbacks;"I had two psychotic episodes in August about two weeks apart and ended up in the same crises center both times. I had no idea what was going on because I hadn’t been formally diagnosed yet. So of course, I’m thinking I’m god or that I’m stuck in a video game or TV show and need to do things to get me out of it. 

When they first put me in a room they told me to just go to sleep but obviously I was freaking out because I had no idea what was going on or where I was. They gave me some word searches, coloring pages, and markers and like I said, I thought I was god. Now for context, I’m not religious at all, but my mom used to have me go to church when I was a kid and she was raised catholic yada yada. So here I am on the floor of the crises center writing a new bible on the back of word searches. Then I get paranoid. So what do I do? I rip the papers up into little pieces and start chewing on them attempting to swallow them. (Also thought I might be dead and in purgatory.) What I was trying to do here was plant a seed, because I always said when I die I want to become a tree. Thankfully I didn’t swallow any of the paper. However, my second episode of psychosis I did eat a piece of dust off the floor. 

I called 911 not once, but twice. Both times they sent an ambulance to the crises center. The first time I did it, I had to give the cops a statement. Now I was terrified because the reason I called the first time was because I woke up sore and with bruises I hadn’t had the previous day. I thought something happened to me in my sleep, because I had a one to one so there was one of the techs, conveniently named Lazarus… watching over me while I slept. 

In reality, the reason I was sore and bruised was because when I first entered psychosis, I thought my phone was bugged so I attempted to smash the screen and my boyfriend essentially tackled me to the ground and was trying to grab my phone from me. But I didn’t remember that at first.

I also wear glasses, I’m very much near sighted and cannot see more than 2-3 inches in front of my face without my glasses. I tried to break my glasses and the nurses confiscated them (for 2-3 DAYS after multiple times of asking for them back) so when I was giving the cops my statement, I couldn’t see anything so it was that much more terrifying.

I keep getting random flashbacks to all the gross, embarrassing shit I did while in psychosis and I really just want it to stop. I’d rather not remember anything from it at all. I also feel extremely guilty for calling 911 not once, but twice, once per episode. I know I wasn’t in a right state of mind when I did those things, but I can’t help but to feel ashamed.";r/bipolar;10;7;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1odf537/psychosis_flashbacks/
2025-10-23 01:21:32;Maybe I do experience minor hallucinations.;"I have Bipolar Type 2, I've been diagnosed since 14 or 15 (I'm almost 23 now) because of an interaction with antidepressants I was put on during a psych ward stay. It was bad.

When I was a teenager, I had ridiculous paranoia and while I didn't see anything (that I remember), I would at times feel the presence of ghosts around me, getting closer and closer. That's not necessarily a hallucination, but definitely a paranoid delusion. 

I've recognized that (I'm not sure if it's during an episode or not) but I'll have periods where I see a plethora of things in the corners of my eyes. Usually people, but sometimes I'll open my hallway door and see a cat running into the hallway, when my cats are nowhere around. I'll also have some days where I hear my name, very quietly, when no one at work is calling for me. I usually just look around, shrug it off, and go back to work.

I've always ignored these things and have assumed they're something that everyone experiences regularly, but it only happens I think when I'm either paranoid, anxious, or hypomanic, so I wonder if they'd be classified as minor hallucinations.

It’s almost as if it’s anxiety, except it’s less intense; that’s why i keep saying energy - like i need to run it off or something.

2025-10-22 23:44:55;Diagnosed with bipolar spectrum, but it doesn’t really feel like it;"Hey everyone,
English isn’t my first language, so sorry if anything sounds weird.

Last week I got diagnosed with bipolar spectrum (no specific type yet, since it was my first visit). I talked about my racing thoughts and how I sometimes self-harm to stop them. The doctor kept asking if I have big mood swings, and I said not really. My mood usually goes from “fine” to “low,” but I never get super happy or overly energetic.

I’ve never been the bright or emotional type either. People usually describe me as calm or steady, not someone with mood swings.

I do have times when I’m more productive or focused, but it just feels normal. My racing thoughts happen most of the time anyway - just worse when I’m depressed.

The doctor prescribed lithium, Latuda, and Abilify. I took them for a week, and yeah, they slowed my thoughts, but they also made me feel flat and sleepy. After that, I started feeling better, like I was finally cured or something, so I stopped taking them because I thought maybe I didn’t need them anymore.

Now I feel okay, even a bit good, and I’m confused. Maybe it was just depression that got better?

I'd been admitted to a mental health clinic(horrifically traumatic, i dont know if i'll ever recover) and diagnosed with bipolar. sent home with medication after a 6 day stay, with no follow up care in place because i was between insurance. experienced medication toxicity and had to go off medication with no medical supervision. tried making an emergency appointment at local clinics but they are filled up and booked out. booked a 2 month out appointment only for them to cancel it twice. new insurance starts nov. 1st. then i have to make an appointment with my physician, just to get a referral for psych, just to try to meds that also may cause me mania and psychosis. meanwhile, i'm unable to work because i can not get a hold of my emotions. i cry all day. i focus on ruminations and constant thoughts of worthlessness. i feel like nuclear waste. i've thought my entire life that if i just got it together, if i worked harder, if i made more money and lost weight and just became a better version of myself, i wouldnt feel like this. now that i have this diagnosis, i feel terminal. my only answer is a pill that might melt my skin off or cause serious weight gain? lithium lobotomized me and nearly made me go blind. is this life? is anyone thriving? i feel like i'm on fire and and the only answer is to drownmyself and i'm trying to find another way out of this;r/bipolar;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1odaa0t/is_it_really_possible_to_live_with_bipolar/
2025-10-22 22:44:21;Grasping at straws before a cycle?;"Newly(ish) diagnosed with a previous mis-diagnosis of borderline. 

I think I might be heading toward a depressive episode but I’ve never been cognizant before so I’m wondering if other people have experienced a sense of trying different things to avoid the drop? 

I wouldn’t call it a personality shift per se, but I’m wanting to buy clothes/shoes outside my norm. I would probably only wear them once or twice and be done. 

Not completely convinced it’s not a hypomanic phase before the descent? But I don’t feel euphoric at all. Pretty panicked, like I’m trying to get my shit together before I go back into the darkness. 

Sorry if this makes no sense. Going to psychiatrist today and just honestly not sure how to communicate what I’m feeling. 

Thanks yall. ";r/bipolar2;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oda8a4/grasping_at_straws_before_a_cycle/

2025-10-22 22:14:04;From esports to Silicon Valley to bipolar: trying to start over;"Hey everyone,

I’ve been holding this in for a while, but I think it’s time I share my story. Maybe someone here can relate, or at least remind me that I’m not alone in this strange reboot of life.

I’m 24, from Jammu, India. My first chapter was all about esports—I played competitively for years, even representing India at an international tournament. Later, I helped run an esports organization, and life felt electric and full of purpose. I really thought that was my career.

But at some point, I started craving something more stable. I pivoted into tech, went to USA for my master’s in computer science at University of Michigan, and threw myself into the grind. I applied to over a 1000 internships, got rejected endlessly… until finally, I landed one in California.

That was probably the happiest phase of my life.
New country. New field. Big dreams. I was doing it.
And then… everything changed.

⸻

In late 2024, I had a full‑blown manic/psychotic episode. I stopped sleeping, became obsessed with AI and “patterns in the universe,” and thought I was connecting timelines. It felt cosmic. It also completely derailed my life.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and Anxiety. I had to drop everything and come back to India. Everything I had built—gone within weeks.

Now I’m in Bengaluru, working as a product manager at a small startup, earning about ₹40,000/month. It’s honest work and I’m learning a lot, but I’d be lying if I said I don’t feel lost, or like a duller version of the person I used to be.

What hurts most is knowing how hard I worked to build that dream—only to have my own mind pull the rug out from under me. I still think about the version of me that never got sick. Would I be earning six figures now? Would I still be abroad?

Some days I feel hopeful.
Other days I just feel tired.
And ashamed.
And angry.
And like I peaked too early.

I don’t even know what I’m asking for.
Maybe you’ve been through something similar—had to start over because your brain betrayed you? Or maybe you just know what it’s like to miss a version of yourself that felt limitless.

If you read this far, thank you.
I’m not looking for sympathy—just maybe a reminder that it’s still possible to rebuild.

Because I’m trying. I really am.
I just don’t know where it leads anymore.

2025-10-22 21:38:16;treatment resistant depression : i have tried EVERYTHING, thinking of latuda or vraylar (24F);"hi !

so i’m type 2 and i have been struggling with severe depression for almost 6 years ; at first i was given lamictal (also because i’m epileptic) and i can’t tell if it really helped but the symptoms were bearable. 4 years before being officially diagnosed bipolar. 

until march 2023, it was the only medication i had ; it clearly wasn’t enough. my depression was only getting worse so i got hospitalized for the first time. i got first diagnosed with bpd ; i started fluoxetine, which seemed to worked great but i’m pretty sure the “feel good” effects were underlying hypomania. 

my bipolar symptoms kind of started showing at that time, plus i started doing coke so it made things worse ; seasonal depression, with hypomania during spring/summer, then severe depression the rest of the year. 

so me feeling good on fluoxetine was probably due to that seasons thing, as i started it on april, and as soon as fall came in, in september, i relapsed into deep depression. from this moment, i upped dosages, switched to other SSRIs, nothing ever worked, things went worse, my seasonal hypomania turned into mixed episodes, depression was so bad and resisting that even the weather change couldn’t do anything about it. 

from march 2023 to march 2025 i exclusively mostly stayed on SSRIs ; i had effexor and cymbalta on top of a little dose of abilify, that was supposed to make the antidepressant work better. 

then i hit rock bottom : unemployed, dropped out of university, moved back at my parents home, can’t take care of myself, no shower for weeks, isolation, addictions getting worse, i wasn’t even thinking about killing myself anymore, i was just so tired of living. i gained a lot of weight, hated the person i became, felt miserable, no self esteem at all. so i got hospitalized for the 3rd time. 

there i got finally diagnosed with bipolar. things  have started to move forward, because i wasn’t fully convinced by the bpd diagnosis and i always felt like there was something else, since they kept telling me that i was on the bipolar spectrum. 

so i started lithium. stayed 3 months on it and it wasn’t working, so they added fluoxetine again; before i stopped taking it because i was completely hopeless and couldn’t handle the side effects anymore.

spring and summer pass, for the first time ever i didn’t have any hypomanic nor mixed episode : it felt like i was stabilized into a severe depressive state.

last month i started seeing another doctor, that diagnosed a treatment resistant depression, and we started abilify again, this time at a higher dosage, 10mg. i feel a tiny bit better but it still isn’t enough.

im seeing him next week because he wants to put me on antidepressants but i was thinking of asking for latuda or vraylar. i read so many positive feedbacks and i really want to give it a shot. i’m already overweight so seroquel is a big no, and i don’t want to be back on ssris ever again.

so i’d like to have your thoughts on this ! thx so much

2025-10-22 21:26:25;Feeling Like I’m Sinking;"TW: SI, substance use/abuse, s**c*de

I (36F) have been following this subreddit for a while, but this is my first time posting. I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar II in March 2022, after experiencing my first full-blown hypomanic episode. (I’m sure there were others, but this one was intense.) Most of my life, I’ve actually struggled more with severe depression (from age 11 on) and anxiety. 

I have made such an effort to stay healthy in spite of my diagnosis. Medication (even before my diagnosis). I residential treatment in June 2022, followed by PHP. I did KAP when I still couldn’t shake severe depression in Spring 2023. I got weight loss surgery in November 2023, so I could lead a healthier lifestyle. My weight made it really difficult to exercise. Unfortunately, I have a food addiction that I’m still battling. 

In December 2024, one of my best friends who I’d been estranged from for about two years died by suicide. The grief has fucked me up. They struggled with bipolar disorder and BPD. We were both at fault for our friendship fracturing, but I blocked them at one point. And so, I was not there for them as they struggled in the last 15 months of their life. I’ve also lost a lot of other people in the past 2 years.

Around the same time as my friend died, I had to leave my job and report my boss for verbal abuse and bullying — the abuse had been going on for over two months, but escalated after I took two days off to mourn my friend. Due to the nature of the industry I work in, the HR investigation didn’t really amount to much. Bullying is not illegal, so the most I could do was fight to be paid out for the remainder of my contract. But I’m running out of money and still unemployed. I do not know when I will work in my industry again. 

I entered a PHP program in February of this year and did another three months of treatment. I stopped drinking. I stopped taking edibles. I changed eating habits. I’ve tried exercising everyday. 

But once again, I find myself sinking into another depressive episode. I barely have enough energy to shower most days. My apartment is slowly becoming a mess. I keep cancelling social plans. Other health conditions have flared because I’m not taking care of myself like I should. I’m not sleeping. And I’ve gained 20 lbs in the last year — when I should’ve still been losing weight post-surgery. 

I do not want to give up or give into this disease. I’ve worked too hard. I’ve fought too long. I don’t want to break the hearts of the people I love, because I know what it’s like to grieve someone who died by suicide. 

But I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can keep battling my mental health like this. I’m exhausted. I just want things to be easier.

2025-10-22 20:35:19;Try again to post. First post deleted.;"First post was deleted as I stupidly mentioned my meds in a comment in response to someone mentioning their meds. I didn’t realise. Anyway, reposting and won’t mention what meds I’m on. 

BP1. Diagnosed a few years ago. Dunno if I believe in bipolar or if I’m just rubbish at life & being dramatic.

Been struggling for months. Had 6 months of hidden hypomania (during which I did all sorts of regrettable things) which turned into a month of mixed mania / dysphoric mania in July/Aug then into what they’re saying is severe depression. I’ve been stuck in house since July/Aug. Except for occasional mandatory trips out in the car to take my teens places. They’re only with me part of the time so when they’re not with me I just rot in bed.

My hygiene has been atrocious for months. I don’t wash or clean my teeth. I forget to drink (not great on lithium). I smell. I wear the same PJ’s day and night. I’m so tired I struggle with stairs. I just have to lie down for 20 hours a day. My room is a disgusting pit: dirty sheets, mounds of clothes, mouldy cups. I manage to keep roughly on top of downstairs for the kids’ sake.

I don’t contact a soul. I’ve lots of friends, colleagues, neighbours & family but can’t face them. When I was under Home Treatment Team in the summer people kept checking in, but since I was discharged 3 weeks ago and have started a phased return to work (logging on my laptop from bed for a few hours a day in order to keep my pay coming) everyone has understandably got on with their lives and no-one checks in now. I don’t think people realise how long it takes to recover. I’m keeping up appearances when necessary but the rest of the time (huge chunks of time - sometimes 5 days at a time) I’m just alone in my dirty bed, speaking to no-one, empty, unable to face the world. I feel like I’m in actual purgatory.

The suicidal thoughts are returning. I can’t believe I’ve gone from a fit, active, fun person with a partner to a fat, unhealthy, weak, dirty & dishevelled person who is single & alone now and probably always will be as my better days are gone. Im on a cocktail of meds which I won’t discuss in case I get erased. 

I’m sorry. That sounds so self-pitying. This is why I don’t contact friends. No one needs to hear this stuff.

2025-10-22 19:32:37;Husband with Bipolar II suddenly left “to think” — I’m heartbroken and can’t tell if this is mania or just him leaving.;"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and hoping for some perspective from others who’ve been through something similar.

My husband (mid-30s) has a confirmed diagnosis of bipolar II and ADHD. We’ve been together for over a decade and married for almost 10 years. He had a major manic episode several years ago that caused a temporary separation, but we rebuilt and have been mostly stable since then. He has not had mania since, but now when I look back he may have had some periods of hypomania, but nothing super destructive or different. He is medicated but are not in therapy specifically for bipolar. Besides that one rough patch, I'd say that our marriage has been very happy and stable. He and I are not physically or verbally abusive.

This year has been eventful - death in a family, work changes, huge investment of time into nightlife. However, there were a lot of events which made me feel like things were good. We were planning things for the future and discussing plans or getting things that have a medium/long term commitment. However, I did notice that he made comments about how he has been sleeping poorly and I remember saying to him ""Please sleep, you don't want to trigger a manic episode"". A couple of months ago, during a couple's holiday, he suddenly told me he was unhappy, questioning his attraction, and wanted to move out to “get space and think.”

He left for a one-month break but said it wasn’t a separation or divorce. He said he just needed time for him to clear his head. When he left, he was tearful and affectionate, telling me he loved me and would be back. But within two weeks of him leaving, his tone completely changed. We spoke he was cold, angry, and dismissive. He told me he doesn't really miss us and that he feels “better than ever”. I am under the impression that he’s been drinking and going out a lot and not thinking, but I have no idea.

When I’ve raised therapy or trying to work things out, he refuses. Most of his friends and family say he “seems fine” or “his usual self"" when they see him (for short periods of time 1-4 hours). I can’t shake the feeling this looks like hypomania — impulsive decisions, emotional detachment, inflated confidence, and avoidance. Still, I keep wondering if I’m just in denial and he’s genuinely done with the marriage.

This came completely out of the blue and I feel broken. I’ve been left to manage our home and pet alone while he’s out living his life with no responsibilities. Has anyone else had their partner suddenly detach like this? Convinced they’re clear-headed, and then later crash or realise it was part of an episode?

Or is it possible this is really him choosing to move on?

Any advice or similar experiences would mean so much. I’m trying to take care of myself, but I feel like my whole world fell apart overnight.";r/BipolarSOs;14;17;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1od5q7a/husband_with_bipolar_ii_suddenly_left_to_think_im/

2025-10-22 18:35:58;Bipolar 1 and emotionally abusive household;"So, its taken me 19 years you finally lable what my experience is. And my bipolar 1 diagnosis put the nail in the coffin for me. I am in an emotionally abusive household and my treatment has gotten worse as my bipolar symptoms have.

I am 19F diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and psychotic features. I caught my illness pretty early because on the comedown of my first manic episode I took myself to the psychiatrists. Since my diagnosis ive gotten a second opinion, told my parents etc

Here is the rundown:  
After being diagnosed I told my dad. now in the household my dad is the more passive one. He's emotionally volatile as in..he blows up really easily, quick to anger..but generally he has better reasoning than my mother. He also has a bachelors in psychology so i thought he would understand. I disclosed this information to him with the promise that he would keep it a secret until we knew for sure, since he wanted a second opinion (though he himself would not set me up with another therapist or psychiatrist).

He told me to never take meds, he told me instead of going straight to the psychiatrist I needed to start with low level doctors, and it should take me years and years before getting a diagnosis. If I had listened to him I would be unmedicated forever since it became clear pretty fast he was just trying to delay the situation and sweep it under the rug.

Now a couple months after I experienced catatonia for the first time. I was alone the whole time, and afterwards had texted my parents about it. the next day when I saw my parents again, my mother questioned me about being demonically possessed because of the bracelet I was wearing. It was 7 in the morning and she was already screaming at me, demanding to know what was wrong with me and chalking it up to a witchcraft fascination i had when i was 12.

Now little did I know at this time, my mom new of my diagnosis. my dad had immediatley broken his promise and secretly told me mom.

Since my catatonia, whenever I do something they dont like they taunt me, threaten to kick me out, repeatedly ask me 'whats wrong with your brain? why can you just function normal?' all while denying me the care that would help me function.

My parents make over $250,000 and could pay for my treatment easily. I make $12.45 an hour and im a full time student. all my money goes into meds and psychiatrists and i cant get any cost help because of the household income. 

Im trapped in a college I dont want to go to, with parents that want to set me off for their amusement.

Usually i am a great student. I entered college with a 3.7, 1 year already done, and was in the honors college. This semester ive only turned in 1 assignment, and missed over half of my classes because of depression. I know at the end of this semester something horrible is going to happen to me";r/BipolarReddit;6;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1od4ozu/bipolar_1_and_emotionally_abusive_household/
2025-10-22 18:05:09;Diagnosed yesterday. Now I’m questioning everything.;"I (41F) had a long apt with my psychiatrist yesterday that ended with her diagnosing me BPD I, and prescribing a mood stabilizer to add to my already prescribed SSRI. To be completely honest, bipolar wasn’t even in my brain as a possible diagnosis. It’s been a long journey trying to figure out my mental health, and it looks like it’s still going to be….
The thing is, now I’m questioning everything! I had no clue I was experiencing mania. And fml did I ever make some devastating choices during those moment. I don’t know HOW I didn’t end up murdered the amount of strangers I would just leave places with. So I sit here and think about some of my big decisions in life, and wonder, if I had been treated how different my life could be right now.

2025-10-22 17:59:22;Good mood or hypomania?!;"Hello!!! 🙃

I’m currently just in a really good mood, but my psychologist keeps telling me I’m hypomanic and not just happy after a period of being down.

(For context I’m very recently diagnosed with bipolar II and I’m not yet in medication - but will start in the future)

She said it wasn’t normal to have cleaned my entire room, gone on runs when I have running, spent a lot of money, haven’t slept and texted people I never speak to, and being jittery and talkative in our session recently. I can see where she’s coming from, but surely this can all be explained by just being happy after being so low?

Anyway, basically I’m just wondering, how can I distinguish between being really happy or hypomanic? 

(Also sorry for the rant!! Being so newly diagnosed I don’t actually understand much about being bi polar, so if anyone has resources or recommendations, I’d love to read!)

In some ways it was weird because she saw me go through episodes and didn’t seem to recognize what they were. She doesn’t really ask about eating habits, sleeping habits, etc., when we meet, but maybe that’s normal for a therapist. Just for me, those are big indicators of my state.

Anyway my anxiety is now so intense and never goes away, its in my body its not so much overthinking, I just sits like a burning brick of tension in my chest. 24/7 I feel like I've just messed up at work and im being taken to the boss.

Ive just started lithium and lamotrigine, im on 100mg seroquel but it doesnt help and I hate it. Do I need an antidepressant as well to help this anxiety?

Got diagnosed with BP this month, after more than a year of taking ADHD + depresion meds. I tried several times finishing a degree in various things (from med school to programming, data science, nutrition, etc...) started trying to find my academic path at 18, now I'm 25 and dropped out again. I can't seem to stick to anything I start; college, hobbies, gym, anything. I always feel motivated when I want a change in life, do all the research to start again somewhere else, and then... I just stop midway. I really wish I could do something with my life, finish a project, graduate, find a job, live my life without always falling short and changing my whole life. 

  
Never had trouble learning or anything, but it feels so hopeless seeing all my former classmates and friends graduating, starting their careers on the fields they chose, I just want to suceed too, that's my biggest wish in this life. I have elderly parents and am the only son, I wanna take care of them, not be a burden at all times, even tho they are extremely nice to me and always try to support me. I just want to live a life that goes forward, not be kept inside this neverending cicle of hope to start something, and the inability to keep going when I reach the midway. I want to find what I like, and stick to it.

  
I dont even know what exactly I'm looking for, I know there's no short and precise answer, but finding this sub and getting my diagnose has made me get my hopes up again, so I would like to ask for your stories, and your help.

I jump from idea to idea or topic to topic because my thoughts race and I have delusions about being in hell (but i am not 100% its true) and about people being in my house, and i get so scared and lock myself in my room. I feel like I can connect with the dead and spirits.... Which i feel is true but on meds i can't do this which leads me to believe it's a delusion, but I also think what if I genuinely possess this ability but the meds are holding me back?

I get angry easily, only sleep during the day and not at night because i cantsleep at night. No matter how hard i try to flip my sleep schedule. My brain is full of bad bad thoughts of people hurting me and i obsesses over them. I can't get things done at all I'm so distracted and anxious and all over the place, even if i try. I make terrible rash decisions. I do drugs. I have unsafe sex with strangers. My room is always filled with junk and i cant even organize myself to clean it or motivate myself.

I experience extreme dissasociation and derealization. this is linked to the trauma because usually i get these flashbacks that im back in my experiences of sa and i zone out and i'm almost there again, and when i come out of it I'm literally realizing how much time has passed and it's so long and I freak out. I can't stop doing it even if i try because it's not on purpose or even something i notice until i come out of it.

All in all, my ""mania"" fits some mania symptoms, but I lack that overjoyed mood, my mood is low and depressed. I've had a period where I was experiencing these symptoms but without depressed mood and anger, but I wouldn't call my mood over joyed. Just normal.

I'm not even sure this fits the DSM criteria for bipolar if my mood states when I'm off my meds is not happy, it's often a very bad mood where I get suicidal and have all of these symptoms slowly come creeping in.

2025-10-22 06:06:52;How do you even know what helps you?;"(Diagnosed Bipolar, 27m)

Maybe it's just me but people seem to know their mind and body in a way that is very strange to me. 

Say you started a new medication. After 4 weeks you feel good. How do you know it's the medication working vs your mood naturally shifted to a slight hypomania or euthymia? Or the other way around: how do you know whether something made you depressed vs you just naturally sent yourself into a downward spiral of despair?  

Heres a little story:

The last year had been the best year of my life. I:
- graduated university
- got a good job
- prioritized sleep, slept 6-7 hours a day usually, felt rested afterwards
- for the first time felt a deep connection with my friends and family and maintained regular contact with my loved ones, many of whom said they were proud of me 
- felt high energy, but remained generally calm and peaceful with very low irritability. 
- loved to do outdoor activities and socialize
..etc.

I had been on no medication, but regularly smoked weed, usually on weekends. I couldve sworn that that ""stable/happy"" state was specifically due to this intermittent-type consumption, where I would feel energized and active throughout the week as an aftereffect of the weekend sessions. This went on for many months and I really believed that I had finally figured it all out...

I gradually started smoking less weed partly because I started getting scared that it wasn't actually helping but just putting me in a hypomania and damaging my brain. After completely stopping I spiraled into a deep depression and Im questioning everything. 

Did it help or was it just hypomania? Was it hypomania specifically because I'm depressed now? Did I just overthink things and led myself down that path? 

How do you guys know anything?

2025-10-22 05:47:29;harder times;"last month, through the persuasion of my partner and parents, i had a brain scan done (as well as some other testing) to reevaluate my condition/ diagnosis. i was diagnosed in Jan of 2024, so im still really trying to find my footing here. we figured that the brain scan and further testing may show other things that could be addressed as i was not having much luck with improvement from the medication i was initially prescribed. 

i was shown the test results, which included a detailed explanation of the imagery. really- it was shocking, and to summarize, the scan showed me things that im finding just really hard to accept. 

i don’t know why, but I went into this whole process hoping maybe I was misdiagnosed and that’s why medication and therapy wasn’t working out for me. but really my dosage is just too low, i was on the wrong meds, not really giving treatment a fair shot. 

this all feels so heavy, like when I was first diagnosed. both times, I had to face something that redefines how i understand myself, how i make sense of my past, even how i imagine my future. 
 
my partner and father are so hopeful though. they see this silver lining and want me to feel that hope too. but I feel like im carrying heavy grief here, grateful to have more answers and a treatment plan set before me, but crushed by what these answers mean. 

any advice on how to keep on the path, be hopeful and distracted from this grief feeling would be appreciated. thanks yall. ";r/bipolar;9;9;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ocq4eb/harder_times/

2025-10-22 05:25:06;Bipolar GF dumped me before we moved cities together;"Some background is that we have known each other for the past 12 years and been friends almost the entire time. 2 years and some change ago, we ended up together when I moved back home. She had a manic episode a year and a half ago. She was then diagnosed and medicated. Recently, she had to get off the medicine due to some health complications that came with it, and has only been anti-anxiety medicine for the past few months. She’s recently been having episodes where she will yell and scream at me in the morning while she was headed to work, start crying uncontrollably or let little fights snowball. Eventually after every fight, she apologizes and says she knows that she has problems and doesn’t mean anything. Well, we were moving in a week and she had just quit her job, we were going to live off the good amount of money I make while she looks for another, and move about 3 hours away to another big city. I go out the night before we go look at houses and end up home late. For context, this is the first boys night in a year and she wanted me to plan this so she could hang with her friends. I get home 2 hours later and I was prepared to go. She starts yelling and kicks me out, has barely spoken to me in the past two weeks and is now making plans to fly to Europe and North America before she has a job. Her financial situation cannot afford that as well as taking care of the dog she has. I know no one has said yes to watching the dog because of the few times she has texted me, it’s always about watching her dog. 

I want to help her see that she is in a manic episode without being mean to her. Her friends rely on her for everything and are rude to her when they don’t get what they want. Her family is really weird about her being bipolar and don’t really help her. Am I crazy and the bad guy??? I don’t really know anymore.

2025-10-22 04:55:26;How often has your medication needed changing? A recent hospital psychiatrist has me worried over the last 9 years of medication. Thank you.;"
I was diagnosed bipolar 2 by 2 separate psychiatrists in 2016. Previously I had been misdiagnosed with recurring depression, and was told by multiple doctors I was not bipolar because I had never been manic.  Often antidepressants would work, sometimes I would become hypomanic but I was not aware that is what it was. Hypomania wasn’t totally apparent until my later 20’s. I have been on and off medication since 2001, and consistently on meds from the bipolar diagnosis since 2016. 

I tried multiple different medications starting in 2016, many with side effects I could not manage so there were many in a short period of time. But over the last 9 years some would work for awhile, I’d get depressed again, and my psychiatrist would add more. At one point I was on the highest dose of lamotrigine, moclobemide, and then abilify, small amount of seroquil and lorazepam. 

Once I would feel better from the depression my psychiatrist did not lower my medications, eventually I asked for it. 

My psychiatrist abruptly stopped practicing and my medications were not helping my depression, so I talked to the emergency psychiatrist at the hospital about changing medication again. She said that my medication history was abnormal. That she had prescribed some patients with bipolar disorder and not had to change anything for a decade or maybe ever.  A medication history like mine would make her possibly question the diagnosis.

I’ve only had the one psychiatrist for bipolar 2 disorder so I thought frequent medication changing was all part of it.  My doctor never mentioned my meds being out of the ordinary.  One particular side effect I would not deal with was weight gain (I read about people gaining a lot of weight on certain meds but it was better than being unstable). I’m in remission from eating disorders (non practicing but it never fully goes away) in my youth so maintaining a healthy weight is part of my emotional well being. 

This was long, if you skip to the end just wondering how often you have had to change medications and dosages?  And how long have you found a regime that works for you?  

Thank you very much. ";r/bipolar2;1;9;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ocos1s/how_often_has_your_medication_needed_changing_a/
2025-10-22 04:40:52;Why I think we'll see a cure in our lifetime... & some helpful resources;"My SO is diagnosed BP and has very frequent manic episodes. I've been researching and learning about the disorder non-stop through out our relationship and I just wanted to share some resources that have helped me understand, react and be supportive as well as share my findings on the latest research, which is why I think we'll see a ""cure"" at some point in our lifetime.

[Crest BD](https://www.youtube.com/@CRESTBD) has been invaluable as well as [BipolarUK.](https://www.bipolaruk.org/)

This comment from Gregg Martin on the [AMA earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jf1c42/we_are_71_bipolar_disorder_experts_and_scientists/) really helped me provide a supportive mental framework during major manic episodes:

* Key elements of supporting and helping them have been: helping them get professional medical help, compassion, empathy, patience, never being judgmental, understanding, LOVE, and a high degree of knowledge concerning the illness. When incidents happen, stay calm, be chill, don’t react emotionally… FLOW… Unless it’s a true emergency, and in that case, take appropriate decisive action.

Remember to set boundaries and take care of yourself.

**Why I think there will be a cure in our lifetime?**

If you haven't already [found the story,](https://www.metabolicmind.org/about-us/our-story/) the Roblox founder's son was diagnosed BP and his family is now pouring millions of dollars into new research to understand the origins of the disorder and bring online new treatments. This has ignited major research undertakings worldwide following the idea that the disorder is caused by an energy disruption in the body, possibly through metabolic/insulin pathways. This has opened a brand new approach to how we think about treatment.

[Iain Campbell ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/27/1227062470/keto-ketogenic-diet-mental-illness-bipolar-depression)( diagnosed BP2) has recovered himself and is now working with scientists and researchers worldwide to understand how a keto diet made him feel better.

[**This interview with him on Dr. Hyman's podcast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCcZb2H2Ceg)**, is incredibly encouraging & raises some really interesting questions about our current systems of treatment.**

I'm not advocating people jump on keto diets and take vitamins recommended at the end of that video (have your SO talk to their doctor), but we may finally have a path forward towards a cure, and I think new viable treatments will be coming online very soon. As in years.... not decades. Thank you Baszucki family!

There are [trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Psychiatric%20Disorder&intr=ketogenic%20diet) underway globally right now.

There is real hope on the horizon!

2025-10-22 03:36:34;Junior in college & struggling;"Hi everyone, I (20F) am currently in my third year of college and up until this point I was on track to graduate. Got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 almost two years ago now after a bad episode also involving school, but since then have not been able to be medicated for really anything except my depression diagnosis from middle school. 

Long story short I'm struggling. I have adhd as well but non-stimulants don't really help, and I feel like I hit a mental wall around may that I haven't gotten over. I have no motivation to do school even caused by anxiety or pressure; now I just freeze and tend to have a breakdown before I even get started. My grades aren't in I'm effectively behind on all my classes. My personal and financial life is a mess and I feel hopeless. I want to drop out or take a break from school but I'm scared to ruin the timeline I set for myself with graduating in 2027 with my friends and my brother. 

My parents are helping me with school financially and so I feel awful not being honest with them about how bad I've been struggling or how much help I need, also because they place a very very high importance in education and not taking forever to get a degree (and also graduating without debt). My professors are being as understanding as they can but they can only do so much to help and I don't want to damage those relationships either. 

I've spoken to my academic advisor and I can take a pause in schooling to save my scholarships, but really I'm just worried about disappointing my parents and my professors. I'm feeling very upset with myself over this diagnosis rn because it changed the entire course of my life. I know this is a lot but if anyone has any guidance or support or even just a kick in the pants I would really appreciate it.

2025-10-22 01:32:47;I’m so scared of the future, after my BPSO broke up with me a month ago;"Context: Ex-BPSO is 33, diagnosed with BP1 since she was 12-13. When we were together she was on medications morning and night. There were a couple times when she couldn’t get a refill because of finances but for the most part she was trying to be as consistent as she could. But. She wasn’t in therapy, and she still smoked weed and vaped. She was able to quit vaping while we were together but she picked vaping right back up after we broke up. 

Yes, on paper, a 4 month whirlwind relationship isn’t *as long* as other relationships that people on here talk about…but it felt amazing, I felt like I had found my future wife. I even bought an engagement ring, and was ready to propose. 

She broke up with me a month ago, after battling “breakup thoughts” for 3-4 weeks prior. She said she just felt trapped and needed out. 

We met for coffee last week, after a text I now regret sending

She told me she doesn’t want me holding onto any hope we’ll get back together. Told me she thought we weren’t really compatible, told me she wasn’t ready to be in a relationship (we got together after a couple months of talking on Tinder, after she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship as she just got out of a relationship…but then 2-3 months later, she told me she *was*, and I even asked if she was sure, and she said yes), etc. said she’s really happy being single. Said she’s never been single for more than a couple months between relationships but she now really wants to focus on being single and focusing on herself and her faith. 

I’d done enough reading to understand that she might not be meaning what she’s saying, knowing her “season of singleness” may not last very long, but I also didn’t want to confront her with that. 

I’m doing my best to move on - doing no contact, in therapy, blocked her on social media, deleted pictures, keeping myself busy

But I can’t stop worrying about the future. 

I don’t have a mean/confrontational bone in my body. 

If she comes back and starts apologizing and pleading, I don’t know that I’d be able to say “no. Bye.”

If I bump into her in public and see her replacing me with someone else, I don’t know if I’d be able to handle it. 

If she reaches out and sees that I’ve moved on, maybe with someone else, I don’t know that I’d be able to handle it if that sets *her* off. 

What if I’m just never able to shake her? What if she just always tries to find her way back?

From what I’ve seen, I don’t think she’s the type of person to do anything too wild…but that’s the scary bit, I don’t know what I don’t know. 

I just can’t believe that this happened to me. I’ve only ever tried my best to be a good partner. 

Even now, I can’t bring myself to say a mean thing about her or her decisions, like my friends have been able to. I can’t bring myself to say she’s responsible for her own actions, she needs to take accountability, etc. I keep babying her and victimizing her in my head, thinking “poor her, suffering with this disease, I wish I could help”. Even now, I’m on this subreddit and doing research, to try and understand and get answers about what happened, through the lens of bipolar, and not just “someone broke up with me, time to move on”. But all this “studying” is just making me more anxious and feeding me all these ruminations and intrusive thoughts. 

How do you just go through such a beautiful, loving, sweet time with someone who wanted to do nothing but love you…and just let them go, realizing the entire relationship might’ve been a manic episode?

2025-10-21 22:27:34;How do I proceed;"I was diagnosed like 2 years ago. I also have other things--ADHD, autism, OCd. Im a mess, i guess. Anyway, i havent been suicidal in years but I feel fully done with life now.

I hate everything, the world's shit, i straight up dont wanna be here anymore. I have a wife and a dog, and i dont wanna leave them behind, so i figure i should try everything before I check out for good. 

A few years ago, when i was first diagnosed with ADHD, i had a really bad experience with medication. Took me like a year to cycle through every stimulant under the the sun, and i was in something resembling roid rage the whole time. It sucked for me and my wife. Im scared of medication, is what i'm trying to say. 

Ive tried neurofeedback, which helped a little. I try to do social rhythm therapy, which helps until my body remembers it's nocturnal. Im just trying to figure out what to try next. I dont wanna just crash out on meds for another year so, can someone just point me in the right direction?

Sorry, there's probably a better, nicer way to ask, but I just cant find it rn. My dog died recently, if that matters? I keep thinking it doesn't bother me that much, but when i bebecom ""lucid"" i realize how much its fucking me up. When i say ""lucid"", I mean I get these weird moments where everything feels real all of a sudden. Like, suddenly im not looking at the world through muddy water, things come into focus and I realize I'm alive. I'm here, conscious in my body, and that is one of the scariest feelings in the world. It's always been scary, but lately it hurts more. Logically I know his death is fucking me up, I just dont know what to do about it. It's one head of the hydra, and i'm to fight the thing off with a spoon. 

So, med recs? The country i live in is trash when it comes to mental health care. I'll have to know exactly what im talking about when i rock up to my appointment, or they'll just throw something at me and call it a day.

2025-10-21 21:35:24;SSRI triggering rapid cycling/mixed states;"Hi everyone, 

This is honestly out of curiosity/confusion and I (25F) wanted to share/ask questions as I've seen some similar experiences in this group. 

I recently had an intense hypomanic episode that came two weeks after bumping up from 25mg (which lifted my depression for 6 months - then I fell into depression again) to 50mg of Zoloft. I've had depressive episodes since probably high school. The hypomania I had was what I've been calling a 'textbook' episode - pure euphoria and energy (from my usually super tired, generally upbeat, but pretty 'lowkey' regular mood/state), impulsivity, hypersexuality, talkativeness/rapid speech, no appetite/need for sleep (I'd take melatonin or hydroxyzine to force myself once I realized this was prolonged/could be risky) and so much self-confidence. Not to mentioned my vision is so sharp almost like technicolor and I can hear EVERYTHING like every sound and music is so euphoric. This has definitely NEVER happened to me before. 

3 days in I reduced dose then stopped Zoloft completely with my psychiatrist, but the hypomania didn't go away. I *started* to come down about three weeks after stopping Zoloft, with a couple to few days of baseline mood at the tail end, but I had a complete independent resurgence of hypomania randomly, and it was more intense. I almost completely stopped eating from lack of need (I'm usually such a hungry person with a ton of interest in food) and completely didn't need or want sleep. The euphoria and desire for reckless behavior was so heightened. Three weeks of that and I crashed into intense daily mood 'swings', tearfulness, feeling awful, so fatigued I was napping 2-3 hours after work then sleeping at 9pm and still exhausted all day. A week of that and I was terrified of going longer without a medication plan (since I have intense depressive lows), got diagnosed with BP2 and put on lamictal. Now I'm back to hypomania one day into lamictal, and a week and a half since coming off my last hypomanic episode. 

I know this is basically going to be unique for everyone and only my mental health team can reach these conclusions with me, but I'm so curious if anyone has had a similar experience? I am at peace with my medication plan and receiving this diagnosis, but just very confused on how this happened more or less.

TLDR; I've never had a hypomanic episode before, just depression. Zoloft triggered my first hypomanic episode, so I stopped taking it and had the episode continue and be considered self-sustaining. Now, I feel like I'm cycling into hypomania with an unusual speed/frequency without medication. Has this happened to anyone before, where an SSRI basically started a chain reaction of your brain cycling and more or less 'developing' mood episodes despite not doing this before?

Thank you all in advance!";r/bipolar2;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ocd4zy/ssri_triggering_rapid_cyclingmixed_states/
2025-10-21 21:10:01;Question about obsession;"The title is a bit clickbait-y maybe, but here's the deal.

I'm diagnosed autistic and ADHD before starting treatment for bipolar. But I'm starting to believe that they've been wrong all along.

I get very attached to people. It's generally one person at the time, often it's a friend. Someone I think about a lot, every day, sometimes the entire day.

What makes me question everything is this: I know our friendship doesn't revolve around me. I know they have a life and I'm okay with that. Mostly. But then their pattern changes and I freak out and then I get angry because I feel abandoned. I know RSD is part of ADHD, but I stopped my ADHD medication because I wanted to see the effect of lamotrigine without it and honestly there hasn't been a difference in terms of productivity or anything (except my heart is a lot happier). I can still get up and do the dishes for example, as long as I'm not depressed. Which makes me believe that maybe it's not ADHD after all. I failed uni because I couldn't focus before going on ADHD meds, but I was severely depressed at the time after moving a long way from home, leaving my dog behind, so maybe that's not so weird.

Can this behavior be linked to bipolar alone, or should I bring up borderline to my doctor? I'm not sure if I'm splitting, I used to talk to someone who's borderline and I also know her favorite person, and what they are describing doesn't sound like me, but it also kind of does? I get defensive and angry when this friend isn't responding for an entire day, hurt, and I start to think of our friendship as bad. Until she responds and explains that maybe she forgot her phone at home or got sick and slept all day. Then we're all back to normal and I like her again.

When we're not talking, I obsess over what she might be doing and with whom. I'm jealous of the life she has, she has friends and a good job and a good life, all of the things I want but don't have. I'm not sure what this stems from or what is causing it and it's driving me slightly insane because I don't want to ruin this friendship.

Just want to vent and maybe ask what you guys think? I have a follow-up meeting with my doc in a couple weeks, and I'm hesitant to bring it up. I mainly have issues with these things during manic and depressive episodes, more during depression because that's when I tend to compare my life to others. When I'm stable, I don't feel the same need to connect with people.

I hope all of this makes sense. I'm not sure how to explain it really.

TLDR; I'm questioning my ADHD diagnosis, wondering if my obsession with a specific individual can be linked to bipolar or if I may be borderline?";r/bipolar2;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1occj16/question_about_obsession/
2025-10-21 20:39:27;Trigeminal Neuralgia and Bipolar;"Just diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. Horrible pain on the trigeminal nerve. Went to the ER and was prescribed gabapentin. Ive been on lithium and lexapro for bipolar 2 for 20+ years. He also gave me 6 percocets. Pain continues.

Saw my primary care doctor, he was reluctant to start trileptal. But it's the recommended course. It put me in a hypomanic episode with severe panic. Stopping it after 2 doses. 

Not sure what's next. MRI came back clear. Neurology appt on 12/12. I have enough percocets for 2 pills a day, so trying to get through this. Taking another day off which will likely be unpaid because I'm out of pto and fed employees in CA don't get disability unless u sign up for it. Which I didn't, didn't know how until now.

2025-10-21 20:02:19;Does this sound like BP2 to you?;"Obviously only a medical professional can diagnose me, it just seems the mental health services near me don't tend to work like that and no one wants to give me an actual diagnosis.

I'm a 30 year old male, and around the age of 17 I started experiencing continued episodes of depression which tend to last anywhere between 2 weeks and a year or two, and tend to happen every year or two. During the times I'm not depressed I'd describe my mood as stable or 'normal' and I usually don't receive any treatment during these times. I was diagnosed with recurrent depression and that diagnosis stayed for years.

The thing that I'm uncertain about is the hypomania, because I'm not sure I exhibit the typical signs of a hypomanic episode. I'm not sure I've ever had periods where I sleep less than usual while still feeling energetic, and I'm also not sure I've had any kind of distorted sense of self-confidence.

I can definitely recall times in my life where my behaviour has been out of character, I've behaved recklessly and impulsively. I've spent large sums of money on things I didn't really need, and in these times I will also consume drugs to excess. When I recall the times this has happened, it doesn't seem to last much longer than a week or two and I can go straight back into depression afterwards.

I've tried over 10 different antidepressants which never seem to have any positive effects on me, potentially even making me feel worse. The last medication I tried was olanzapine, which pulled me out of depression but I had to stop due to side effects.

Sorry if this was a bit of a ramble, I just wanted to try and include as much info as possible. TIA for anyone that reads this.

Do you think this could be BP2? ";r/bipolar2;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ocb1io/does_this_sound_like_bp2_to_you/

She said that  i am lazy, egotistical and creating my own problems rather than having depression.;I just don't understand why i can't be sick like other people, expect help and support from my mother when i am struggling. I finally opened up to her, told her what i have been going through and she just attacked me with words. She didn't even listen. She prevents me from getting a diagnosis. I still don't know what my 'problem' is and i have really been trying but now i gotta start all over with another psychiatrist because she just talked behind my back with my current lovely psychiatrist. I am really struggling. Even writing this post takes too much mental energy. My heart is hurting. She just tells me to push through, sleep at a reasonable time, etc, etc. As if i wouldn't be able to want to do those as well. My parents made me hate myself. Thankfully my therapist and a friend of mine are really understanding and gave me support and validate my feelings. But i just can't stop hating myself because of my mother because of not being able to be functional like i was before, because i feel like i keep creating problems now. My therapist said by searching out a diagnosis and mental health treatment, i am not creating problems, i am actually solving them. But my mother acts like i am just creating problems and i don't really suffer that much. She and my father has caused a lot of the problems i have. I don't understand why i always have to appear perfect. I am so tired of putting up a mask. Why am i to blame for having hardship the moment i struggle a bit. Yesterday i talked more openly with my therapist, my friend, i felt so much better and accepted even as my weird self. I talked more openly with my mother too, but she just kept putting me off. I don't even know who i am anymore. I have been feeling like i am losing my own control ever since covid. And i have lost a lot. I have learned a lot as well. I feel like only now, just lately i have started really healing. Really understanding why i give the reactions i do to the outer world, how my brain is actually trying to protect me from harm but it may be faulty and causing more anxiety than necessary.

I was heavily suicidal back then as well and the only thing that comes between me and dying is the wish to see the northern light. I wanna die while feeling satisfied with my life - that's my thought 

Fast forward to 7 yrs now and Last 2 week, I had my dream vacation and it includes hunting for the northern light. The weather didn't help much in Sweden and I completely absolutely lose my hope. But thank God in the end, the northern light decided to show itself in its glory in Norway. At first I didn't seems to believe it myself but the screen on my camera prove otherwise, and slowly I'm able to see it more visibly as time passes by.

While others seems to be awestruck and busy with the camera clicks, I just stand and and it took me back towards those awful depressing days. I did cry silently and remember my promise. Tbh the northern light that night wasn't intense as what I would've wanted and either I'm addicted to it or I'm just greedy of wanting more of it but that night as I remember my promise, I also kinda don't want to end my life now. I wanna see the northern light more and more.

So what's next? I...honestly have no idea but the promise that I made which to die after seeing the suicide are the only promise I'm not able to fullfill. That's what I told my younger self. That out of all promise, those are the one that's not gonna be fullfill. I think ....

Even after I was diagnosed, I raw dogged it for years before getting medicated (so glad I’m medicated now). The issue is, my son who is in his early 20s is now acting like I did in mine. I recognize it, his mom recognizes it, and we paid for 20 sessions with a professional who also recognized it and diagnosed him with Bipolar 2. He has substance issues (which is an added layer I didn’t have to deal with, so I don’t really know) which seem to make his depression even deeper and longer, but he won’t give it up. He also won’t get medicated because he doesn’t want that stuff in his body.

My wife, his mother, is beside herself not knowing what to do and we’ve been together for 26 years, so she has plenty of experience dealing with unmedicated bipolar 2. My son’s girlfriend doesn’t know how to help. I’m the bad guy for doing things like taking him on vacation when he was little (I know it’s the bipolar contributing to that perspective). Just like me, he’s trying avoiding dealing with what is going on, and as a parent who has been through it, it is killing me. How do I get him to recognize he needs help?

My dad is in his late 60’s and was diagnosed with Bioplar I about 10-15 years ago. Growing up he never had bad manic episodes, and he had a very successful business. There have always been signs tho. He has always been a heavy weed smoker and a functioning alcoholic (think 6 beers a night), which is why we think the episodes were not too bad growing up. However as he got older, things got worse. He retired and moved to a different state away from family and this seemed to set him into a bad spiral, as he smokes significantly more and drinks more. I live in a different country and last time we visited home to see him 2 years ago, he went into a full manic episode in front of my husband and I, screaming horrible stuff to us about me, my family and anything he could think of, getting into my face and just screaming as loud as he could for hours, with no one else speaking but him. Was a terrifying situation, in which we had to abruptly leave. We later found out this was a drug induced psychosis from him using cocaine. He never apologized and I had to work on it in therapy for over a year as I was traumatized. 

We are now set to go home in 3 weeks to see my family and have a baby shower for me as I am 5 months pregnant. My dad has spontaneously stopped drinking and is in a full blown manic episode now. He has bought 2 houses, and a very expensive car he can barely afford. At this stage he is being hateful and telling both my sister and I we are the worse humans ever and don’t love him, and is texting absolute novels to me in which I can’t even bring my self to read as they are filled with hate about me, my husband and anyone else. It has gotten to the point where for my own mental health I have had to block his number. 

He refuses to get any sort of treatment or come to terms with the fact that he is even bipolar, even though he has been diagnosed and held in a psychiatric ward before. We are not even allowed to say to him he is bipolar. 

I am due to have my baby shower in 3 weeks and no longer can have him attend (his idea) as the last 2 times we have visited, he has had manic episodes and tried to fight my stepdad, me and my husband; and is currently now in another manic episode. How do I deal with this situation? I am worried of many situations, like him showing up, him harming himself or others, and it turning into a very bad situation. 
Sorry this is so long, I am just lost and very anxious on how to handle this and what to do. And it makes me feel helpless he refuses to get any sort of help.

Hi friends, looking for a bit of advice. I’m AuDHD and I was also diagnosed with borderline in 2022. I’ve had mental health struggles for about as long as I could remember. I’ve been in therapy most of my life and also on psych meds since I was about 12. 

There’s been a cyclical nature with my moods for awhile now, at first I strongly thought it was PMDD until I noticed it doesn’t always follow my menstrual cycle. 

My mental illnesses have felt like a big puzzle I’ve been trying to solve for years. Getting diagnosed autistic/adhd in 2023 have solved parts of the puzzle, and I feel like I know by now how borderline shows up in my life as well. It feels like there’s 3 parts of me in my brain, ADHD me, autistic me, and BPD me. I’ll have chunks of time where I’m in a really really good spot, those different parts of me stay in their separate corners of my brain and keep to themselves. I still struggle with AuDHD & BPD symptoms but I feel like I can access my mental health “tool box” and give each of those parts of me what they need in order to manage them. During these “good” chunks of time, I feel more functional than I ever have - sometimes I’m convinced I’m “cured” and that I won’t have a bad dip in my mental health again. 

And then it’s like a physical switch goes off in my brain, with no specific trigger at all. It’s like there’s an evil goblin up there that toggles with the switch for fun and I don’t get a fuckin say in it. That switch goes off and suddenly my mental health tool box is shut with an impenetrable lock around it and those different “parts” of me suddenly start fist fighting each other to the death in my brain and I try to break it up and get them back to their corners but nothing works. Suddenly, all of the symptoms of each of those disorders are exacerbating the fuck out of each other and my mental well-being goes into the gutter. My mood swings are insufferable, especially the BPD symptoms, I’m constantly overstimulated while extremely under-stimulated at the same time. Essentially, I’m drowning. I’ll get suicidal, my self harm urges are super strong, and I can barely control my reactions to things. It’s a nightmare. Then the switch goes back on and the “good” me is back. I feel back in control and like I can mitigate all the symptoms I struggle with. And this cycle repeats and repeats and repeats. 

I didn’t really catch onto this brutal cycle until it happened so many times and my boyfriend brought my awareness to it. I thought it was just the borderline but with all the research I’ve done on BPD, the mood swings don’t span for long chunks of time like I’m experiencing. I started questioning if it was bipolar, but I can confidently say I’ve never experienced mania before, I have friends that are bipolar and know what that looks like. Then I learned about bipolar 2, I read so many articles, I read so many personals accounts of peoples experiences with bp2 on this subreddit. And it’s like another fucking puzzle piece clicked into place. 

I talked to my mom about it one day and she opened up to me and told me that she has been diagnosed with bp2 and so have countless others on her side of the family. 

I hadn’t been to a psychiatrist in awhile, I ended up ghosting my previous one because the office was so difficult to interact with and it frustrated me so much that I just stopped going. With all of this recently happening though, I got a new psychiatrist and I’ve explained all of this to him. He won’t even help me look into if this is a possible diagnosis. It really discouraged me but I thought he’s a professional and knows what he’s doing. But it’s weighing on me so heavily and I brought it up again in our most recent appointment, I told him about my family history with it and that I really feel like there’s a chance that bipolar 2 is the missing puzzle piece I’ve been missing in my mental health journey. He again said he is confident that’s not what’s going on. I don’t know what to believe or think now, I feel so lost. I feel broken. I feel like this is a deadly cycle that I’ll be in for the rest of my life, and there’s times I wonder if there’ll be a point in my life where the “bad” chunks of time get so bad that I finally take my life. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you so much and if anyone has any words of advice, or if maybe what I’ve described sounds like there’s a good chance it could be bipolar 2, please tell me. I know no one here can diagnose me of course lol but I guess I just wanna know if I have enough evidence surrounding this that I should find a different psychiatrist to explore this possible diagnosis with.

2025-10-21 06:26:01;"I have been suffering for too long and Im exhausted fighting an inner battle against bipolar 2. Please give me some realistic life changing advice if you have any. Not the typical ""Go out , exercise, eat well , etc etc"". Im barely able to brush my teeth properly.";"Even to write this post neatly I had to take the help of AI, because my thoughts are too scattered right now.

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 around ten years ago.

Not a single doctor ( in India) was able to give me the right mix of medicines until a few months ago. One doctor, seeing that all the combinations had already been tried, put me on **modafinil along with mood stabilisers, antidepressants, and sleep meds.** Now my brain is working at least 6 hours a day — but the timing is all messed up.

I’m quite active mentally from **3 AM to 9–10 AM**, and then that’s it: I’m stuck in bed either sleeping or completely drained out of energy.



**My past cycle**  
Earlier, it used to be **8 months of severe depression or brain fog**, followed by sudden clarity for a week or two — and then straight back to depression.

Because of this, I have **no career despite having an MBA.** I have never gotten hired because even though at the time of a written test I get hypomanic and do really well, by the time of the interview I get super depressed.



**Current struggles**

* I’ve been trying to apply for a **disability certificate** so that I can at least depend on the meagre state pension, but the process is so triggering and difficult, and my family is completely against it.
* I’m **29, still dependent on my father** (who fortunately understands my condition instead of kicking me out).
* I haven’t done any **physical exercise in years**, have gained weight, and my body feels like a machine without lubricant — it just cannot move its parts. I can barely stand up for more than half an hour during my depressive phases, which is most of my daytime.
* I tried adjusting my sleep but it hasn’t worked.
* On top of this, I have **insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, high lipid profile, early kidney failure symptoms, and a 20+ cigarette-a-day addiction.**



**Hypomanic phases**  
In my hypomanic phases, I dream of grand business ideas. But I lost the little savings I had because I could never follow through later, once the depression hit again.



**Dark thoughts**  
The only reason I’m alive is because guns are illegal in my country and I found no other painless option (**I’m safe right now, just struggling**).

I used to be the brightest student in school, college, and even in my Masters despite bipolar. But after COVID, and after leaving the safe, controlled environment of university, my life has been going downhill.

And now there seems to be only one solution — but I’m too afraid to do it.



**My question to you all:**

* Have any of you been in a situation like mine?
* Did you manage to turn it around?
* Which **medications** helped you most?
* Which **lifestyle changes** made a real difference?
* Do you have any **personal advice** for me in particular?



This is as real and raw as I can be. Any advice or perspective would mean a lot right now.

2025-10-21 05:04:22;Do you ever feel like you were misdiagnosed or you're a fraud?;"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (2) about 2 years ago. Since then, I havent had many manic episodes as I am more depressed bipolar than manic. I usually have long depressive episodes, but I also get mania. After mania, I fall into long depressive episodes. Originally, they were 4 or 5 days, now theyre 7+ pretty much every time unless I am taking something tp manage mania. They usually are like 4 days with mania meds.  We stopped that. Usually, stress, overuse of caffeine, and poor sleep hygiene equal a manic episode. The longest ones involve stress... like, trouble dealing with things emotionally kind of stress usually. When I realozed I am gay I had mania so bad i forgot to go to work for a week. When I found out my last girl friend cheated from day 1, I had another one for 1 week. Other facts in combinations do too, but the stress thats hard to hand emptionally usually has to be present. At the same rime, if i am sleepi g for 2 or 3 hours (not manic style, but just intense insomnia withoit mania symptoms where i am exhausted) it happens a LOT faster. 

Am I just struggling with a variation of denial? I mean, I know 3 psychiatrists have told me bipolar, two of them saying type 1, the third saying type 2, so I am trying to operate like I have it and take the meds, try to follow instructions from doctor, etc. I just feel like an imposter or fake. Does anybody understand this? Does anything help? Would chatting with a therapist or psychiatrist help? Like could they help me see why I am or reassure? I dont know.

Recently, things have been feeling bad. My mental health has steadily been declining throughout these past years and I think I’m at my lowest. 

I’m unemployed (no experience and seems like I don’t appeal to most employers because of that), and have no irl friends. My online life is more social than irl. I feel alone a lot. I feel like I’m so behind from people my age, like I’m stuck in the mindset of an emotionally unstable preteen. 

I should probably seek out a therapist but my insurance is pretty shit and my family is currently very poor. I feel stuck. 

I feel like my unsteady moods just hurt those around me. I’m constantly pushing them away, being snappy, am too quick to anger and feel annoyance. I feel like my needs are too much for people. I feel selfish and unhealthy to be around.

I kind of didn't know where to turn but I got out of an appointment with a psychiatrist and am feeling pretty emotional. I can't call my mom because she cut contact with me out of the blue (I moved to another country and other factors, not diagnosis or manic related) and since I moved to a new country to be with my husband in his home country I'm all of a sudden feeling pretty alone. I didn't have much support back home anyway so the only difference is that I have at least him to be here. But he doesn't really understand mental health disorders too much so while he is supportive I could really use folks that do understand.

I'm 32. Woman. I was told I had ADHD before and got treated for that but nothing worked, it all made me so much worse but with the BP2 that makes so much sense now since it was stimulants.

2025-10-20 23:44:33;manic „god complex” vs narcissistic traits;"Not seeking diagnosis, just looking to understand patterns!

I’m currently trying to understand the difference between the so-called “God complex” that can occur during manic or hypomanic episode and narcissistic traits that might appear independently of mania.

From what I know, manic grandiosity often includes a strong sense of invincibility, special purpose, or connection to something greater — sometimes even spiritual or cosmic in nature. However, I’ve recently noticed some self-centered and inflated thinking patterns in myself that don’t quite fit that description. It feels more like a subtle shift toward narcissistic self-focus rather than full-blown grandiosity.

A psychiatrist once mentioned that I might be moving toward bipolar disorder, so I’m trying to analyze these experiences before assuming anything. My main question is: how can one distinguish between narcissistic tendencies (possibly as a defense mechanism or stress response) and the early signs of manic grandiosity or a “God complex”?";r/bipolar;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1obm29d/manic_god_complex_vs_narcissistic_traits/
2025-10-20 23:31:55;“But you seem fine”;"I first got diagnosed at 16/17 but have been involved in mental health interventions, for lack of better term, since I was 5 for other behavioral issues. I’ve struggled with self harm, suicidal ideation, drug abuse etc. In my eyes, it’s obvious that I’m someone that’s struggled with mental health issues. But I think somehow, I’ve been dealing with these symptoms for so long that I’ve managed to conceal the worst parts of this disorder. Nobody believes me when I confide in them that I have bipolar. They always tell me “you seem fine though? I don’t think you have that”. 

It makes me want to scream because they don’t know that when I’m hypo, I stay up till 4 am every morning taking small sips of air because my mind is running so fast I don’t even have time to breath. They don’t know that I’m in debt because of manic shopping sprees. They don’t know that I manically reach out to my abusive ex boyfriend and see him just to feel something because I feel nothing inside. 

And for the depression? I’m wondering how the fuck they couldn’t see that. I went voluntarily mute for 2 years when I was a teenager. I had a 0.5 gpa because I only went to class twice a week. It wasn’t normal to be snorting pills at 7am on a Tuesday when I was 16. I was literally a ghost. But they still couldn’t see it. 

I think part of this issue for me is that I’m an artist by professional and I’ve always had a taste for extremes. Due to my anxiety, I’ve developed this intense self discipline and so I never deviate far from my rigid routines because if I do, then I am overwhelmed with morbid anxiety. They see me waking up early, running, working on art, getting my things done, etc. But inside, I’m often battling with an internal voice all day long that’s telling me to end my life. 

I’m just getting to the point where I feel like there’s no point in telling people I have this disorder. Especially in dating, I’ve always confided in the men I’ve been with that I have this history. Partially because I’m covered in self harm scars and feel the need to explain. But they either dismiss it, try to tell me that I seem fine, or they just ….. never touch base on it again? And then in the future if I do have a depressive episode and I try to be honest about it, they act surprised even though I already explained that, yes, I do get depressive episodes. I don’t know.

Tl;dr: People never seem to believe that I have bipolar, even though I feel like it’s glaringly obvious. They all say I seem fine, regardless of self destructive behaviors. I’m tired of opening up to people because of this.

2025-10-20 23:29:32;How did you stop drinking completely?;"I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder for context. I can't view the sub for stopping drinking, but hopefully you guys can have some tips since substance issues can be comorbid with the condition.

I was doing good and didn't drink for 2 months then yesterday I ended up binge drinking and I'm not sure if I took my medicine last night either. I didn't sleep good so probably not. I'm getting kind of better with not drinking over the years, but it's difficult in a culture that is always surrounded by alcohol. I do want to stop completely one day because there's no benefit to it.

I already quit thc back in March, but that was never a huge issue since I always got paranoia from it. Alcohol is different because everyone around me casually drinks. They don't see me having an issue because then it would point out their own issues with drinking most likely. I can go some periods without drinking then end up binge drinking when I drink. I figured out I can't limit myself when it comes to it. It's like the same with eating. I'll binge eat sometimes especially if I restrict for so long.

I would like to see if anyone has tips on staying completely sober in a culture surrounded by alcohol. :)

I'm most likely going to ask for some kind of medical intervention for these problems (binge eating and drinking) at my next appointment because I'm tired of this cycle, but medicine doesn't work by itself so I'm asking for more tips.";r/bipolar;10;25;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oblqgx/how_did_you_stop_drinking_completely/

In 2020 I got kong covid and my mental health and self esteem has been terrible ever since this has led to a rocky career being fired several times, money issues and me using porm and pursuing interaction outside if the marriage to self soothe.

I realise I messed up and my wife has simply had enough and decided to leave me.

During the run up and since she left I have had these insanely intense episodes which go on for hours and can be very traumatising for me, my wife and my daughter.

I often cannot leave a room and need to be seen and spoken to and the more people shut doors and tell ne to leave the worse and worse I get. I csn be angry but never violent its always from a place of hurt and I often collapse and cry asking for love and affection as I am so lost in it. My wife was cold and my daughter crying as she was scared.

I feel so ashamed if myself and wish it never happened but im trying to now pick up the pieces, get medicated properly and ideally resume my place in family 

My wifr literally said she doesnt love me anymore and hates being anywhere near me and i know its because her body still flinches around me because of my mental health.

I have sincr moved out as the pain of being so close to someone i love yet them treating me with such hostility is too painful and triggering.

I have expressed at every opportunity that om getting the help i need and am trualling various medication to get stable but i am worried i have done too much damage to ever come back.

Selfishly i want anoyher chance but i also understand that shes properly had enpugh and ive had countlees opportunity to get this sorted.

Any advice? How can I influence the situation? The constant worry and analysing is keeping me in a bipolar cycle and all I want yo do is go and talk to her which obviously creates tension amd dear again


Im not a bad person I am just unwell and have been through a lot with physical and mental health, I feel misunderstood and wish I could have got myself under control before traumatising my kid and wife.

She keeps saying that I should jist calm down, leave the room or go for a walk and never behave this way infront of our daughter but in th3 moment I am most likely in some sort of flashback or very locked into the manic episode I cant rationalise.

I am not directly thinling ot unaliving myself but I do feel the guilt, shame and loss is overwhelming and I dont deserve to be here.

2025-10-20 22:14:51;Britney & Kevin: The SO speaks their side & some are taking notice;"Sometimes our lives play out in public with famous people and their SO struggling with the disorder, this past year it was Kanye West and Kim K.

And as we all know, the world will never fully understand it unless they live it.

However the recent Britney Spears case is coming to light now that Kevin Federline is releasing his memoir “You Thought You Knew” (a fitting title) and I’m seeing *some* of the public turn to finally understand the SO side. 

The original side of people that still believe that Britney’s conservatorship was all about taking her money and slaving her to work, when we know here it was put in place to ensure she’d take her treatment or she’d lose all custody after her 2008 episode with psychosis. (Crashed car, shaved head, knives, drugs, hospital… and that’s only what we know)

Back in 2008, Lithium was the only med as Abilify had only just been invented, and there was little public awareness or info online, so the stigma factor was in full force and the Spears family kept the diagnosis out of the media… she got stable and started to lead a healthy lifestyle again.

Fast forward to 2019 and Britney started to get antsy about being forced to take meds under the conditions of it and publicly slammed her family, sparking the “Free Britney” movement and accusations that the family was drugging and enslaving her. 

The conservatorship was cleared after the kids were old enough to make their own decisions. (When it was, I predicted that she’d stop treatment and be in an episode within 9 months, and so did her then husband and he divorced her and quietly slipped away)

That’s exactly what happened. And now Britney has been publicly posting posting nudes and some scary content on IG, bringing her current episode into the public eye… while still accusing her family and projecting onto her SO.

For better or worse the public is now seeing an episode unfold in real time, and Kevin is using his platform to tell the world about how difficult it is and trying to turn “Free Britney” into a “Save Britney” movement. Some buy it, some do not still and that’s the uphill battle we all have.

Of course, she’s projecting him as a gaslighter and it’s a cash grab, but Kevin has enough money (and probably isn’t making much off this) and her kids see the episode so they avoid her… but they all love her and now fear for her life.

I’ll post the NYTimes article in a comment below, since it’s paywalled. And Britney’s responses, with her tweets from yesterday.

My point is that, unless other people in our orbit SEE the disorder do they only begin to believe us that our partners need help. And if you need to convince another person now after Kevin’s memoir is released on Oct 22nd you’ll have an example to point to.

We all love and respect Britney like our own partners, and hopefully this Hail Mary move by Kevin will jump past the stigma and show the world that treatment and help is needed.

2025-10-20 20:04:41;I hate this/no motivation;I’m 17 and I just feel like my whole life is ruined. Growing up I had my own family issues (mom is bipolar as well, parents had a messy divorce, bunch of other stuff). I started having substance issues in 6th grade also the first time I tried to off myself. Never got any help cause “therapy is for weak people” according to my mom. Anyways years of different substances, sexual encounters, and depression I eventually moved in with my dad got in therapy and stuff.I got diagnosed my sophomore year but I didn’t have a bad episode ig until like Junior year.I ended up going homebound and everything. It’s senior year now,I have no motivation to really do anything. Everyone alr told me my life will always consist of therapy and meds. Even on meds my baseline is depression and I’m always irritable.I saw a new psychiatrist and she wants to see me more often and put me on antipsychotics. I already take 5 medications (for a range of issues) and everyone always says how I’m mean, crazy, lazy, ect. I don’t try to be it’s just who i am i guess.I haven’t been to school in a week cause last week I couldn’t stop crying for more than 3 hours and honestly now I just see no point. Go to school where everyone thinks I’m mean our insane(had a bad episode in front of most of the school junior year) just to graduate and get a job I probably won’t be able to stick with because I’m always so depressed. Everyone always says to just push through and that it’s life. People been telling me that since like 1st grade, I hate it here. What’s the point of living if I know my life is going to be shitty, even if there are good times it’s still shit.;r/bipolar;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1obh82k/i_hate_thisno_motivation/
2025-10-20 14:11:43;Is this hallucinations or...?;^(Hi. I was diagnosed with Bipolar last year and have been medicated since last November. Over the last probably 6 to 8 months there have been weird things happening in my apartment, but it's only at night when I'm laying down to go to sleep. I hear footsteps walking down the hallway (I live on the top floor so I'm not hearing someone walking above me), and it'll sound like someone is walking into my bedroom and then it'll feel like someone is sitting on the end of my bed by my feet. I have also seen what looks like the shadow of a person wearing a hood peeking into my bedroom. Am I hallucinating? Is this something I should bring up with my psychiatrist? Are hallucinations common with bipolar disorder? I don't want to be hospitalized and I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else but this is really freaking me out and it seems to be becoming more frequent. Please help.

2025-10-20 12:52:35;My bipolar boyfriend has been distant, critical, and suspicious lately, I’m confused and don’t know what’s normal anymore.;"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some perspective and to hear from others who’ve been in similar situations with a bipolar partner.

A little background: my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Most of the time he’s kind, warm, and funny but sometimes he becomes very cold, irritable, and critical toward me.

A few weeks ago, we had a small argument about something trivial. I asked what kind of salad he wanted from a salad bar, and he said “just salad, salmon, and dressing.” I brought exactly that, and when I got home, he looked disappointed and said, “it’s so dry  didn’t they have tomato salad?” I reminded him he only said salmon and greens, and he snapped, “should I have written a list?” When I said I just brought what he asked for, he said, “are you really that stupid?” That really shocked me. He later apologized, but it stayed on my mind.

Then recently, it happened again but worse. For the past three days, he’s barely spoken to me. Two days ago was his birthday. I spent a lot of time preparing something special: I made a gift box with a shaker and an espresso martini recipe, cozy slippers, a scented candle, flowers, and a handmade card where I wrote kind things about him how inspiring and warm he is, and how grateful I am for him. Inside the card I included “activity coupons” like a dinner, movie night, escape room, or climbing, things he could choose from.

After work, we went out for dinner. He thanked me for the gift but was quiet and irritable the whole time. Asking what was wrong didn’t help — he just said “nothing.” When we got home, we watched a movie, and I started cooking for him. I didn’t follow his recipe exactly, and he told me I’d “ruined” the food and made a few hurtful comments. I ended up crying. He went for a walk and I went to bed.

The next day he barely spoke again. That night he finally said what had been bothering him he noticed I usually shave before going to visit a close friend in another city. (For context, I shave once a week, and it just happened to be before seeing my friend a few times.) He accused me of maybe seeing someone else and said, “how do I even know you’re really visiting your friend and not another guy?” I’ve never cheated or done anything suspicious, so that really hurt.

He also said he feels I put more effort into seeing my friend than into him that he expected we’d dress up and have sex for his birthday. I had actually planned to, but after the earlier insults, I didn’t feel like it. He said I’ve been “down” and “on a celibacy streak” lately, though we’ve still been intimate about twice a week.

He told me his diagnosis has made him afraid of acting impulsively or hurting me. He mentioned being hypersexual and said he’s scared he might do something stupid. Then he said maybe he should move to Helsinki alone. After all the criticism and distance, it really hurt to hear that.

He also said it doesn’t make sense to continue the relationship if I’m “just sad all the time.” He said no one cares about him not even me. But the truth is, I care so much. I clean our apartment every other day, cook candlelight dinners, and try to be supportive in every way I can.

Now I feel completely drained and confused. He goes between being sweet and thoughtful to distant, critical, and suspicious.

Is this kind of behavior something others have experienced with bipolar partners? Is this normal during certain phases? How do you handle the combination of distance, criticism, and mistrust?

Any insights or personal experiences would be really appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;6;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1obb2s8/my_bipolar_boyfriend_has_been_distant_critical/
2025-10-20 12:25:14;20F — Diagnosed with bipolar, stuck at home, and feeling lost. Need advice.;"Hi,

I’m 20F and I don’t really have anyone to talk to in real life, so I’m sharing this here. I just want advice or perspective from people who might understand.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently. Everything started to fall apart when I went to college in the city. New environment, new freedom, and I became impulsive — spending money I didn’t have just to see my boyfriend, lying to my parents about tuition, and skipping classes. I tried vaping “just to try,” but it became a habit.

After I stopped going to class, I hid it from my family until I couldn’t anymore. I told my mom everything. She allowed me to take a break and go back home to the province. It felt like relief at first, but then I just stayed inside my room for months.

Later, I went back to the city to work. I learned a lot, met people, but I also made reckless choices — relationships, substance use, debt. Eventually, everything crashed down. My sibling found out, I got caught, and my parents brought me home again.

Now I’m here in the province, living with my grandparents and extended family. They feed me well and I have a roof over my head, but I feel locked out — like I’m stuck and not free to decide anything for myself. There’s no way they’ll let me leave or live independently again.

My own father doesn’t have a stable job, so he can’t even provide for my medication. I’ve been off my meds for a week now, and I can already feel my mood shifting again. It’s hard because I want to get better, but I don’t have the means to stay consistent with treatment.

My mom keeps telling me “ginusto mo yan” whenever I try to open up. I’m currently attending therapy (my next session is Nov 5), but in between sessions, I feel completely lost. My dreams are so vivid that I wake up even more tired. Sometimes I feel like I’m slowly losing myself.

I want to get better. I want to study or work again someday. But I don’t know where to start, or if I even can.

Also, I don’t really have friends anymore — just online friends who try their best to listen. I guess that’s why I’m posting this. I just want to hear what other people think, or maybe know that someone out there gets it.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you keep going when you feel trapped — even when your basic needs are met, but your soul feels stuck?

I'm only 20 years old, and knowing that I will have to live with this for the rest of my life hurts me deeply. I also feel friendless because my last manic episode made me lose everything and everyone. I just started college, studying Software Engineering, and I don't know if I'll have the strength to continue. They say programming is very stressful, and with this condition, stress will always cause me suffering. I wonder if I'll ever be able to get an internship. I don't study at one of the best universities in the country, but my college is good. But me? I'm just a person destined for failure. I wanted to be a programmer, I wanted to work with what I love, but today I see no future in it, or in anything I might do. Why continue college if I won't be able to become a programmer? Why continue living if one day I'm going to have a breakdown and lose everything? I won't even be able to get an internship, and my English is terrible for trying for one in the future.

2025-10-20 11:13:27;I understand why my mental health got so bad.;"When I was 12, I became aware that I was going to die. I couldn’t handle it and for several days I had a severe panic attack until I literally couldn’t feel anymore. I began dissociating from then on, my emotions were just too strong.

This carried on through all my life. I gradually got more and more detached from reality. At the start of high school I felt mostly over everything. I just floated on through life, not caring about anything.

Over the course of my first two years of college things worsened. At first the fresh start in life was a relief. But over time I gradually got so paranoid of people that I could hardly even function. I was completely detached from reality and hope. Swapping between being energized and being hopeless, curled up in bed feeling like I’m being strangled to death. 

I got diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few months ago and got on pills for it and now that old fear of death keeps haunting me and making me feel like my life is only seconds away from ending. There’s nobody to help me. My friends seem more distant than normal. I don’t know what to do anymore.

2025-10-20 10:38:33;Bipolar ex vent/advice;"I (25f) have an ex (26m) who was diagnosed with bipolar 1 four years ago along with a slew of other mental health issues. He was diagnosed following a semi forced psychiatric hold after I found out that he had been cheating on me. Our relationship was loving and supportive until this and I genuinely had no clue about this side of him. Following this our relationship spiraled in to toxicity; I was hurt by his cheating and he felt that he wasn’t responsible for the actions that happened during his manic episodes. He made me responsible a lot for his emotional state and I was in constant fear that if I expressed my hurt by his actions he would hurt himself.  Last year I found out he cheated again and he admitted to lying to me, his therapist and attempting to go off of his medication. We broke up the beginning of this year and he moved into the same apartment complex as me. I thought for a while we could be friends but repeatedly he would accuse me of emotional abuse after our breakup, cut ties and then want back into my life. Now months later I’m in a new happy relationship and my ex is harassing me. He claims to have recovered memories of me assaulting him while we lived together post breakup and has begun posting this online with my full name and if I’m out the location I’m at. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m so tired. I spent nearly three years holding my emotions and trying to help him to avoid him lashing out. I got a call from his close family member that he was no longer taking any medications again and was cutting ties with his whole family for being unsupportive. His friends don’t know/don’t care that he is manic he will not seek help and I’m afraid that he won’t leave me alone but I have spoken to legal aid and the police; he has made no overt threats of violence against me so I don’t really have any recourse except to have him trespassed from my home, that doesn’t stop him from posting about me or harassing me in public. I’m so broken over this and I carry a lot of guilt that I couldn’t help him.  If I just ignore it will he leave me alone? do I tell his close friends to get him help?

2025-10-20 10:07:38;Just couldn't live without lamictal.;Got late diagnosed a couple of years ago and put on lamictal. Immediately felt a difference at 25 mg but titrated up anyway. Long story short, got a really bad rash and had to get off and tried a bunch of other stuff over the course of a couple of years but it just didn't work. Tried going back on lamictal a couple times during that time and got rashes each time. Finally decided to get real scientific and started at .01 mg. Yes, really. Took me 60 days to get to 25 mg but with the help of color coded pills and a spreadsheet I did it. My increments never exceeded half a milligram. I monitored for anything that was not benign, such as mucous membrane involvement, fever, blistering, peeling.  It's not easy but I'm really glad I did it.

I'll start a new job, be optimistic, but then maybe like a few work days in I start getting avoidant and a huge ball of anxiety in my stomach. I refuse to go to work. I end up calling out or just straight up quitting.

I just started a new job two days ago and today is my third day. I'm sitting here about to tell them this job isn't a good fit for me.

All l feel is eyes on me. My family who judges me and doesn't understand how this is a side effect of my disorder. I know my boyfriend is understanding but I feel like he sees me as lazy, even though he tells me he's here for me and it's okay to not work this job and just quit.

l've been a tattoo artist for over 2 years now, and it's an amazing job. I love it so much. I show up, I do a great job, l feel no anxiety. But this part time job I just picked up is needed to make my ends meet.

What do I even do? Why won't this just end and how can I get the people around me to understand that I'm not lazy, but that this disorder is so crippling.

Please if anyone can tell me their similar experiences, or a way to cope with how people see me going through this with jobs.

I'm a 26yo woman, recently diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2, and honestly it has both been a blessing - of finally puting a name to it - and a curse - because what do you mean I have to be medicated for the rest of my life?

The side effects of the meds are scaring me - especially the weight gain and the skin problems, the dizziness and foggy thoughts too.

I work as a structural engineer, on big projects that demand my utmost focus, which I didn't achieve these past couple of months because of an intense depressive period, and I'm starting a new job on November 1st, and I'm honestly terrified of what taking this medication will entail, and also scared of what not taking it will do to me again.

Please, give me your feedback on the treatment, I am honestly lost and terrified, I don't want my cognitive performance and appearance to be impacted negatively.

It made a lot things make sense. The last four years have been horrible. I feel like I lost myself in so many ways. Like how do I convince myself this is worth it? My life feels so stagnant. Any hopes I had as a teenager are all gone. I wanted to work corporate and get out of being low income and provide myself everything I needed not even wants. Now I can barely hold down any job I do. I got hurt last December at work and I’ve been dealing with that. It has added even more of a pause to my life and more debt I have no idea how I’m pay off. I want to have faith in something but what kind God would be so cruel to give anyone this disorder. I am trying so hard to stay positive. I’m trying to figure out a plan. I know this is a bad moment and I have to accept that. I know this all over the place and I’m sorry. I just don’t know how people live with this disorder truly. Everyone keeps telling me I need to do soul searching to figure myself out. I don’t know where to start when I feel bipolar takes up majority of my life. ;r/bipolar;25;6;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oazz0h/how_am_i_supposed_to_live_this_for_the_rest_of_my/

Can't gather my mind at all. But then what's my damage then? Am I actually bipolar and having an episode?

Right now,  my mind is so loud and I feel so overwhelmed that I want to scream forever. I feel restless, like I'm suppose to do something but don't know what. I'm stuck in some kinda endless loop of misery and I can't get out. Meditation doesn't work at all.  

I don't know where I'm going about with this. I was thinking maybe go to the ER because I feel like I'm going INSANE with how I cannot calm down and stop my mind running 100 miles per hour, but I think they're just gonna pop me a benzo to calm down, and even when I do get sent to psych ward, they'll give me something to calm me down.

2025-10-20 03:24:57;Any Suggestions fellow BP Amigos?;"Good morrow fellow friends,

I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible but finding it hard to make sense if you know what I mean.

I’m clinically diagnosed in the UK and attend out patient care with a psychiatrist.

The last week I had a hypo mood spike which topped on Friday and yesterday and now seemed to have levelled off but I’m on a come-down.

I feel absolutely shocking.  

I have also not been sleeping and experiencing paranoia.

My heart rate is through the roof and I can’t stay still.

Anyhoo

I find it very difficult to speak about it to friends and family because I feel like I am using them as a dumping ground to express how I feel and don’t want to burden them with my problems.

I’ve applied for talking therapies with a trained professional but I’m on a waiting list.

Do you have any suggestions where I can verbally talk to other people who are Bipolar who understand and share similar experiences?

2025-10-20 03:24:22;i’m terrified of the idea getting diagnosed with bipolar 2;"i’m 20 and a few years ago, my therapist (who i was seeing for depression) advised me to talk to my psychiatrist about my mood swings and my episodes because i was checking most of the boxes for hypomania. 

i was 18 at the time and i honestly didn’t want to because my episodes were giving me a type of euphoria i was craving with a passion no matter how unhealthy that was.

i did it and got diagnosed with cyclothimia because the intensity of the hypomanic episodes wasn’t that bad and got prescribed antipsychotics along with antidepressants . i was honestly very unsatisfied with the way they made me feel, i’m also suffering from intense depersonalisation and the meds were making it worse. and on top of it all my psychiatrist was very non receptive when i was telling her the meds are making me feel worse. so i ended up just stopping meds and seeing her anymore (not very wise ik).

2 years later and both my hypomania and depressive episodes have gotten way worse and intense, and my depersonalisation is becoming unbearable. i’m still seeing the same therapist which is genuinely the most patient and understanding therapist i’ve had. she said she knows a very good and understanding psychiatrist and that i should really give another try to medication before it gets even worse.

i agreed and i have an appointment but now thinking about it i’m really scared that my diagnosis is gonna be changed to bipolar 2 because the situation has gotten so much worse and if before i checked most of the boxes now i’m checking all of them and more for both hypomania and the depression.

idk if i’m afraid of being judged because if the diagnosis or not taken seriously or anything like that. but i think having it on paper might make the fact that i’ve gotten worse real? i’m really confused and it makes me really sad.";r/bipolar;3;13;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1oayk0k/im_terrified_of_the_idea_getting_diagnosed_with/
2025-10-20 02:37:17;Every time I believe in God, I reach out to my doctors…;"I wanted to share a small part of my story because I don’t have anyone to talk to about this..

I (24F) was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder four years ago. I was told the likelihood of bipolar 1 was low due to not being hospitalized in the past. I switched psych doctors (what a BLESSING) and opened up about some scary situations I’ve had. She changed my diagnosis to bipolar 1.

I have had multiple manic episodes that have led to religious psychosis. I grew up in a christian household that took demons very literally. My mom is 100% all believer of the supernatural. I think this contributed greatly to my episodes. I recently asked my mom why she never thought about getting me help, and she said it was because she believed me. I immediately switched my medical power of attorney to my fiancé, and I have been stable for a while. Working through these things, I’ve learned a theme for all of my manic episodes… they always start with me believing in god…

I am NOT shunning anyone for being religious, but I genuinely am not a spiritual or religious person when I am stable. My episodes are always the same: I believe in god one random day because he has chosen me. He has chosen me because I am a profit. Then it spirals into the devil does not like my prophecies and comes for me. 

I know this isn’t much help, but I have not disclosed my diagnosis to much people. I think this is just a really weird phenomenon for me, and I often think of it when my family brings up the fact that I’m atheist. It’s literally dangerous for me to believe in a higher power, and that’s just something odd to consider.

2025-10-20 02:29:27;Do you feel misunderstood being bipolar? Do you feel invisible and like you're disappearing?;"I am 48 years old, and I discovered three months ago that I am bipolar type 2. I have had about five depressive episodes, the most recent lasting nearly 12 months. Despite these lows, I was a very functional person—until I turned 46. I managed to function with all my challenges, always pretending everything was fine and not respecting myself. Smiling, being polite, cooperative, and loving. I got married, had a child (I ended up divorcing because he was a violent person). I built a good career, had many friends, bought my apartment on my own, and was always responsible with my money.  I resigned from my good job in the middle of this long depression (before my diagnosis) because it was a toxic environment and a huge trigger for me. I realized I would never get better if I didn’t leave. I’ve been out of work for almost 10 months. I’ve been looking for a job for 5 months, despite the fear of not being a good professional.

This whole situation makes me afraid that many people will find out about my condition and, as part of my professional network, won’t believe in my capability. Do you understand? 

Then I thought it was important to share this with closer and more trustworthy people (at mosg 5 people). However, I realized that some of them irresponsibly share this information with others, which really bothers me deeply. My sister-in-law, for example, with whom I always had a great relationship, started treating me as if I were practically incapable after hearing from my mother about my situation. She acts as though none of my actions or ideas are valid anymore—to the point where I send her common and neutral messages and don't even receive replies.

The other day, my mom met a close friend of mine at a social event and started talking about my condition. She gave a ""historical evaluation"" of my behavior, commenting that I have always been a strange, critical, and sulky person *with her*.  

I felt deeply betrayed because my mom is my only true support network. I feel very lonely and invisible so on.

I’ve been taking Lamictal 200 mg, Seroquel 100 mg, and Bupropion 300 mg for 20 days. 
I’m not sure if I’m stable, depressed, or experiencing hypomania, honestly. I don’t know which of these three states I’m in (perhaps the length of this text indicates some level of hypomania?), but the truth is that I’ve started feeling very anxious (more so than before), emotional, and extremely irritable. Do you feel the same? Is this depression or hipo?  Having so many doubts about me, maybe I really am disappearing until I become invisible, even to myself.

I like to think I'm my own individual after going through my past, but it's starting to feel like all of my actions, feelings, and experiences amount to no normal experience other than just another symptom. My mother looks at me like I'm at the edge of breaking and it feels like I'm never going to get past her worries of this illness towards any point of independence. I'm scared all I've ever amounted to be as a person is just another check to my actions in an episode. Any amount of generosity, care, love, sadness, disappointment, or even talent is just another notch for people to blatantly see that there is something wrong with me.

It's worse now after another episode where I was incapable to getting out of bed, remembering anything, and getting to class. Worse now that I struggle again to even take care of basic hygiene for myself after being incapable of doing it for more than a month again. 

I'm scared that it's going to swallow me whole someday. I'm scared I'm going to amount to nothing but being bipolar and the other diagnoses I have. I'm scared that I'm actually as incapable and worrying as my mother thinks I am. I'm scared that I'll never have any amount of normalcy or individuality other people my age have.

2025-10-19 23:20:48;SSRI-induced mania got me my diagnosis;"Months ago I got on citalopram (Celexa) 10mg for anxiety/panic attacks and increased to 20mg after 2 weeks. It was extremely helpful at first honestly; no panic attacks, way less social anxiety, brought me out of this weird dissociative and numb state I had been in for a year. 

Fast forward to 2 months on the dose where my mood started getting very unstable. For a few weeks it was more depressive symptoms (suicidal thoughts, constant sobbing, worthlessness, lack of motivation, poor hygiene, etc.). Then it flipped into some of the worst aggression of my life. Alongside the typical symptoms I’ve experienced in past manic episodes (barely sleeping, racing thoughts, restlessness, hypersexuality, impulsivity, making all sorts of plans, etc.), I was SO irritable which I hadn’t experienced to this degree before. Snapping at loved ones in rage over trivial things and felt like I could not stop talking (yelling) as though my mouth had a mind of its own. In one instance I was throwing things, in another I was yelling till my nose bled and didn’t even notice. Not fun to be around. I was thankfully lucid enough to realize it was a problem once I started getting violent thoughts and the people around me also just expressed deep concern.

Turns out I’m bipolar 1. I’m tapering off of citalopram and got on Abilify which has been a fucking miracle. I was hesitant but Abilify has stabilized my moods the most they’ve ever been while also managing my anxiety and paranoia.

Can’t begin to express how relieving it is to finally understand why I’ve been this way for so many years. Citalopram came in clutch in a weird way

I go through phases a lot and I’ve been trying to figure out why. I’ll be super happy and hyperfixated on something for a week or 2, which I thought was just my ADHD but I notice I also go into phases of deep depression. Like currently I haven’t left my bed in 3 days, I haven’t showered, I can’t find the motivation to even go to the toilet until it gets to the point I’m in pain, the only food I eat is a packet of chips or Reese’s peanut butter cups, all I can do it watch tv.

I also often feel extremely paranoid. It’s a lot worse when I’m high. 

I also find that recently I’ve been really struggling not to self medicate. I vape and smoke weed but that’s all I’ve ever done. But I’ve started thinking if maybe MDMA or coke would make me feel better. I obviously don’t think it’s a good idea but I’d do anything to just feel some sort of happiness right now. Considering my family is full of addicts and I can’t even go an hour without nicotine.

Last night I finally left bed and all I could do was cry on the couch and cradle my birds urn - she was a support animal and really helped me.

2025-10-19 21:21:07;ADHD diagnosis is messing everything up...;"I've been lurking on this subreddit for a long while and I absolutely love this community so I thought it would help posting. I'm sorry this is so long and rambly, I hope it makes sense, I just need to vent.

**TL;DR: I recently got an ADHD diagnosis so now my doctors are questioning my bipolar disorder and I'm freaking out about it.**

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost 4 years ago. That same week I was *also* diagnosed with another chronic illness and because I was overwhelmed suddenly having two chronic illnesses I ended up focusing more on handling that diagnosis rather than my bipolarity. I thought oh well, I have meds balancing me out, it's fine.

Obviously it was not fine, but it took awhile for me to understand that. 2024 was an intense AF year and I was seriously hypomanic a couple weeks in the spring, followed by a long bout of hyperactivity  (I didn't know that I had ADHD at that time so it was very confusing) so I never really crashed as hard as I usually do -- or I did, to the point where I got physically ill, but I just chalked it up to being exhausted because of all the stuff I had going on, plus a case of suspected Covid. Then in the fall it all caught up with me and I crashed harder than I had before. It was honestly scary. Before all that I didn't have regular contact with my specialist doctor or psychiatrist (where I live in Sweden we're assigned to a ""team"" of two nurses, psychiatrist and a specialist doctor) because I thought I was fine and I didn't actually do anything to handle my bipolar disorder, I just took my meds and kept on as normal. I eventually forced myself to set up an appointment weeks later and started actually learning more about what I need to do to balance it all out and ofc realized I had done the absolute opposite.

Since then I've had to stop working, I've had lots of appointments and been in regular contact with my doctors. I demanded the group course that everyone who lives with bipolar 1 or 2 should attend when you first get the diagnosis (I didn't get that 4 years ago) and, after a couple years of speculation, I finally was assessed for ADHD. I've gotten some fantastic healthcare since I moved to this town five years ago, it really is remarkable. But once I got my ADHD diagnosis, things started to go downhill.

I said in one of the assessment interviews that I had trouble distinguishing between hypomania and hyper activity when I looked back over my life. The psychologist took this and RAN with it. He started questioning my bipolar disorder and started speculating I actually wasn't bipolar, I ""just"" struggled with ADHD. I of course panicked (like, don't take my meds pls) and said I really didn't think so, that I just don't know enough about both diagnoses to give him clear answers. He said since I haven't had to go to the psychiatric emergency department because of my bipolar disorder it's unlikely I have it. But I HAVE DONE THAT and I told him about the times I was extremely depressed and was seriously considering, y'know, the big S. And he said ""yeah sure but you've never sought out emergency care for a hypomanic episode which is what we look out for."" which is just an unhinged thing to say because like WHAT???? And I insisted he was wrong, but he brought it up with my doctors and it turned into a whole thing. Never mind the fact that there's a huge overlap with ADHD and bipolar disorder, never mind the fact that I have friends and family and old roommates that insist that the difference between my hyper activity and hypomania is CLEAR AS DAY to them and have told my doctors that. Never mind the fact that I'm TELLING THEM THE MEDS AND CARE I HAVE GOTTEN HAVE HELPED SOME but I just didn't know how to handle the stuff outside the medication (like sleeping, and diet and routines). 

Since then I've had to advocate for myself in a way I've never had to with in the healthcare system in this town. I have a fantastic GP with fantastic nurses and gyn. And even this psych department has been incredible. As a fat/plus size woman I've had some shitty fucking doctors that have said some messed up stuff (like the time I wanted to kms and she said I needed to lose weight <3), but I have never once experienced anything like that in the past five years. I've talked to basically the entire psych department begging for them to take me seriously when I say that it's not ""just"" ADHD and that I still need help with my bipolar disorder.

I recently met with a specialist ahead of me starting my ADHD meds and I wanted to settle this whole issue once and for all. I've never met this woman before and she was very clinical and asked a bunch of questions about how I was before I started lamotrigine a few years ago. I told her everything I just told y'all and she was like ""well you're not bipolar type 1 that's for sure"" which isn't something I've ever ever ever claimed. That's not what I'm saying AT ALL. Then she said she can't ""rule out"" that I'm bipolar but she also can't rule out that it's ""just"" the ADHD.

I'm still on my meds, and I'm starting a bipolar support group in a couple weeks, so they're listening right now but I can tell they're reluctant. The woman in charge of the support group agrees with me thank GOD but I'm just exhausted. I've started questioning myself even as I'm looking at my mood tracker and seeing a pattern. ""Maybe it's just 'normal' depression and your ADHD working together"" ""Maybe you just want to be bipolar for the attention or to be 'special'"" ""Maybe they're right that you can't be bipolar because you struggle more with your depression than hypomania"". It's EXHAUSTING. It's extremely common there's an overlap with adhd and bp2, all the books, all the science and the specialists say so. Why am I the exception? I just wanted an ADHD diagnosis knowing it would help me with routines and help in my day-to-day so that I can stay balanced and maybe get my life back on track. Instead it's just.... this.

I know this got long, I'm so sorry. I just needed to rant because no one gets it. My GF also lives with bp2 (before anyone questions it: our relationship is great, we balance each other out and know what signs to look out for so it's actually helped us both a lot) but she doesn't know how to help with this since she doesn't have ADHD and hasn't been questioned like I have. It actually upsets me sometimes because it makes me feel like I'm not ""bipolar enough"" to be taken seriously. She's super supportive though, which is lovely but I feel like I'm spiraling more often than not and I can't explain why.

Any words of wisdom or encouragement is appreciated. Thanks for reading <3

  
EDIT TO ADD: I know NOW the difference between the hyperactivity and hypomania. But because I questioned it ONCE some of the doctors are so sure it's just the ADHD. After a lot of reflection (when I was more stable than I am now) and tracking my mood consistently which I haven't done before, I'm sure of the difference between the two. I can point to specific times in my life where I've been textbook hypomanic, esp before I started my medication. Irrational and intense anger, spending to the point where I almost ruined my life, hyper sexual and reckless. I would bury myself in projects and I thought I was better than anyone else, that no one could do my job better than I could. At one point I took on so much work that I was basically working 140% and my boss was so happy with me that she started expecting me to deliver that sort of performance all the time which is why I crashed and had to stop working. I feel like the reason I have been struggling som much is because my ADHD made it hard to keep up routines which I know is crucial when you're bipolar and because when I did get hyperactive it could trigger a hypomanic episode. 

Should be noted too that if they were to remove my bipolar diagnosis I would be discharged from this specific department. They're understaffed and overrun with sick people, so I just feel like they're trying to push me out so they can help others IDK.

However, recently I’ve been feeling extremely tired, I’m sleeping as often as I can and my mood has gone down quite a bit. I’m often sad or annoyed or just numb. I recognize these signs so I’m trying to take matters into my own hands and solve it. I’ve put down rules of when I can sleep, when I need to eat, I’ve added vitamin supplements to my diet (I live in a country where it gets dark 24/7 during winter so vitamin D is essential). I unfortunately can’t make myself workout, even though I used to be quite active, but I’ll get there. 

I’m wondering what your strategies are when you feel like you’re getting close to a depression? I will of course contact my doctor, but in the meantime I’d like to do what I can to resolve this myself. I work a lot, I have a demanding job and I absolutely love it so I don’t want to jeopardize it in any way. It’s a generous job though, I’m allowed 3 hours per week during work hours to workout or do something that’s healthy and good for you. I also receive a health and wellness benefit that’s about 500 dollars per year to spend on like a gym card, massage or something similar.

I havent had a hypomanic episode since end of 2023 though before I went to my new psychiatrist. I started going to her right after basically. She brought up how she is doubting the diagnosis. She has never seen me in a hypomanic episode. She doubts it because I was on a very high dose of antidepressants both wellbutrin 300mg and sertraline 200mg with the mood stabilizer oxcarbazepine 900mg and I didn’t shift to a hypomanic episode at all. My bipolar is mostly depression to be honest. Is it normal I didn’t shift even though I was on that much of a high dose of antidepressants? ;r/bipolar2;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1oamp3p/am_i_misdiagnosed/
2025-10-19 15:55:07;How long does it take to receive a diagnosis?;"I always felt to be weird compared to other people, but started to be very noticeable beginning university studies.
To me it was very difficult to go on exam and delayed my degree some years.
Working is terrible: I constantly left jobs because at the minimum problem / report from supervisors I felt useless and not suitable for the task. I changed about a job every three month.
Now l've the same job for the fourth year, but feeling very bad. Like ""I can't do it anymore/| feel inadeguate/ I need to change"".
Recently I had some crysis and now I'm at home for some days as one of the episode happened at work and colleagues are worried.
I cannot handle criticism, any of them. I also could become quite aggressive sometimes.
I have some obsessive-maniacal behaviors (for example: I have to use that shampoo or the day will be negative).
The specialist told me it could be a bipolar disorder, but too early to determine it now.

However my family are immigrants from Iran so it’s not like they had a lot of mental health support or education on it. It’s also hard to tell what’s bipolar and what is trauma in my family because they have experienced extremely intense generational trauma aka the Armenian genocide then escaping to Russia just in time to have some be murdered and targeted in the Soviet Union then fleeing to Iran then just to live through the Iranian revolution. My father grew up dirt poor and my mom subjected to the strict treatment of women even being arrested and subjected to lashings.

Everytime i try to confront him about his actions he rebuffs it. He is already on lamotrigine and has been prescribed an Antipsychotic for a shorter duration but he refuses to take it and also goes on to say that it would lead him to depression and i would be to blame for it

All that being said, i know its not him. I have seen him from childhood, he was a calm sorted person and all i want him to understand is its his mania  and not him doing these things.

2025-10-19 10:58:52;SAD with Bipolar?;"Hi everyone, I am asking this here before discussing with my psychiatrist (which I will regardless of what's shared in this post) but has anyone had worse int depressive episodes during winters? I recently got diagnosed earlier this year and went on med starting July and have been stable all throughout except my motivation dropped but now I'm good since I got put one Wellbutrin.

My question now is, after 4 months, I've had a major depressive phase where I've been extremely down and crying my eyes out for 3 consecutive days (it could last longer but I hope not). Are there people with bipolar 2 that need two different medication regimen throughout the year?

2025-10-19 10:27:47;I’m so, so, so exhausted;"**Trigger warning for abuse, suicidal ideation, homelessness, dangerous behaviour and some other not-fun stuff.**

I was doing really well for a while. And then the shit-show that was the latter half of this year happened.

I realised somebody I used to trust with my life had been abusing me. I figured it out when his current partner came to me and disclosed a pattern of abuse so brutal and horrendous that it made me vomit. I tried everything I could to help her. I destroyed myself getting an escape plan set up for her. I burnt bridges with most of my community and I even went to the police to report the physical and sexual assault that he had perpetrated against me, which resulted in absolutely nothing happening to him. But I thought if I could just help her leave, it would all be worth it. And then she decided to stay. I haven’t heard from her since, except when I had to report her missing because he took her phone and texted me that she was in danger “as a joke”.

The stress of it all forced me into a hypomanic episode. I went on a bender and spent my rent money on coke that I did with somebody I had known for maybe a month. He and I had unprotected sex. Because I couldn’t pay my rent, my housemates kicked me out. They told me I had to leave within 24 hours. I asked them if they could give me at least a week because I don’t have any family and friends I can stay with and they kicked me out on a Friday, so there was no way I’d be able to find crisis accommodation. They said no. I had to fight tooth and nail to be able to extend my stay there for two weeks, and it nuked the friendship. I don’t talk to them anymore. I was homeless for close to a month. I’ve finally got housing sorted. I started unpacking my boxes the other day (they packed up all my shit while I was gone) and they sent me off with a lovely parting gift of three full boxes of trash.

I had close friends who were there for me, but they have disappeared. I can feel people pulling away from me because I don’t know how to fix myself so I’ve been desperately clinging to them hoping they can help me. I’m devastatingly needy. My partner is struggling to cope with it. I’m struggling to cope with it. I wake up most mornings hating the fact that I’m alive. I loathe myself. I’m so sad all the time. I went to the psych ward a couple of weeks ago hoping they could help me and it achieved absolutely nothing. I’ve been doing everything right. I’ve been seeing my psychologist weekly. I’ve been sober for about a month a half. I take my meds and I’m trying to keep a healthy sleep schedule. I haven’t been going out partying. But it’s not enough. I feel like I’m in free fall.

I’m going to see Metallica in two weeks. They are the only thing that got me through my inpatient stay when I was diagnosed BP-I, and right now, they’re the only thing keeping me alive. The only reason I haven’t tried to take myself out is because I have their concert to look forward to. But beyond that, I don’t see how I can go on.

2025-10-19 05:23:57;Coming out of a mixed episode: desperation, delusions, emotional block;"Hi everyone,

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I’m currently coming out of a mixed episode. Honestly, **I can’t take it anymore**. Most of the day I feel constantly desperate, experience delusions, unpleasant tension in my arms, and numbness in my left leg. About twenty days ago my treatment was adjusted, and while some symptoms have improved, I still feel sad and basically just as bad as before.

In my current state, it’s like everything I remember torments me—**as if I don’t have any good memories about my life at all**. If I’m not lying down reliving the past, I try to distract myself with other things, but it’s really hard to **keep my focus**—both mentally and emotionally. I lose attention, motivation, start to feel uncomfortable sensations, or just become sadder.

I’ve tried everything: studying, watching videos or movies, listening to music, playing games, and even trying some exercise, but **nothing seems to last or really helps**.

Has anyone else gone through something like this?  
What helped you? Do you have any advice, strategies, or just encouragement you could share?

2025-10-19 05:21:26;Needing advice on my bipolarSO;"I’ve been with my partner for about 3 1/2 years. He is diagnosed BP1 and it’s a struggle. Last April I had to leave him because he was abusing any drugs at his disposal, and being a form of himself that I had never seen before. He was emotionally and verbally abusive. I moved out and we didn’t speak for about three months. We got back in touch and I came to find out that he fully relapsed with IV drugs after I left but went back to treatment and got clean. Right now I’m trying to give him a second chance and I’m trying to work on trust. I’m seeing all the patterns and it’s scaring me. I love him dearly, he’s never cheated, and he seems to be truly trying. Can this work out in the long run? I have a child I need to think about as well. My son loves him and sees him as a fatherly figure. I’m struggling to know what the right thing is, to know if staying by his side is the right thing to do. 

Any advice is appreciated, and I can answer any additional questions. He is currently medicated, but I’m not sure if he’s taking it consistently. He was recently manic, and seems to be coming down from the manic state. And I fear a depressive episode is coming on. He does have a consistent psychiatrist and case manager that he has been seeing for many years. He has a very long history of alcoholism and IV Drug addiction. In the time we’ve been together the longest he has been sober is one year. His relapses are usually one night of drinking and then 1 to 2 weeks in the hospital rebalancing his medication.

2025-10-19 04:02:37;My partner keeps wanting to leave and then changing his mind?? How am I supposed to navigate this.;"My partner and I (28M, 30F)have been in a relationship for 3 years, 2 of those years was a LDR, we have now lived together for almost a year. Just before moving 1000 miles to be with me, I noticed he had been acting strangely, and when I confronted the issue he sounded like a stranger. Talking about how he couldn't feel anything anymore and he was only going to make me miserable and he was breaking up with me to protect me and wasn't going to make the move. I was devastated, to say the least. But I felt like something was VERY wrong, more than just with our relationship. He was already being treated for depression, so after several days of pleading with him I convinced him to see his Doctor. He ended up walking away with mood stabilizers, a different type of antidepressant, and a Bipolar diagnosis. This rocked both of our worlds, but the change in meds saw a marked improvement. He moved down here and everything was going well (aside from some financial issues and the usual growing pains of adjusting to living with someone for the first time)   
Until Just recently, about 6 months after the initial episode in which he abruptly decided to end things, I opened a text on his phone while choosing a song on Spotify for us to listen to, with the intention of reading it to him. What I saw shocked me. He had contacted his former manager several days prior and was making the arrangements to move back to his hometown and take his original job back, also mentioning that he would need to ""pack discreetly"" so I ""wouldn't know"". Not a single mention of asking me to come with him. I was devastated.   
I confronted him about it, and he insisted that he didn't think he even meant it, he was just feeling so miserable and empty and he wanted to go home, that he spent the week or so that he was making the arrangements ""flip flopping"" on what he really wanted, because he was ""of two minds"" that he wanted to ""bet with me"" but also ""wanted to stop feeling so horrible"" and that he inevitably ""changed his mind"" and was ""never actually going to go through with it"".  But everything had felt perfect from my perspective, and even from the things he had told me during that period of time. Once we got it all out in the open, he cancelled the transfer with his previous boss, and reassured me that he definitely still wanted to be here, that he thought this was maybe a symptom of his illness. We agreed this felt like the previous time and that he should see his doctor again about his meds, since this seemed to be so out of nowhere.  
  
I'm not sure what my intentions are in posting this. I just don't really know how to navigate this and I'm hoping for some insight. I understand he has a serious mental illness, but I feel heartbroken and angry that he would want to just abandon me....even during an episode. 

Is this kind of thing normal for Bipolar? Should I expect it to happen again? How am I supposed to cope when the love of my life might periodically decide he is too sad and wants to blow up our lives? I am reeling trying to piece together how to tell the difference between what's ""real"" and what is his disorder.

2025-10-19 03:56:49;How do you deal with family denying your condition?;"I was diagnosed with “soft” bipolar late in high school. At the time it made a lot of sense, I certainly experienced severe depressive episodes. I also experienced episodes where I was on top of the world, one of the best students academically and socially, dated the prom queen, figured out the meaning of life, etc. I was also a budding alcoholic and frequent psychedelic user.

Once I was medicated (lamotrigine), however, I never experienced another undeniable hypomanic phase. I questioned my diagnosis, assumed my experiences in high school and early college were normal (teens come out of their shell and think they’re the shit right?), and even that the alcohol somehow created false symptoms. I felt like a fraud.

Over the next couple decades, I came to the understanding that it’s a spectrum, that I fortunately didn’t have to deal with severe mania, that my medication helped and that the on off nature of my depression was itself a symptom. I still felt like a fraud. Just to pat myself on the back, I did get sober and survived the 30th birthday my doc said I wouldn’t see. I’m at 8 years sober now. The last couple months I had my first severe hypomanic episode in 15 years and it became undeniable.

What I can’t shake is a few conversations with my parents. My dad, who bought me a very helpful book about bp2 when I was first diagnosed, admitted that he didn’t really think I was bipolar. My mom, whose behavior has made me lose a lot for since I got sober, went so far as to tell me I wasn’t bipolar, that not sleeping doesn’t indicate bipolar, that she talked to her therapist friend about me and decided that I was just ADHD. Like, Christ, I avoid talking about myself to you because you’re so judgmental and a walking example of the fundamental attribution error. I never even said anything to her indicating my belief that I did have this disorder. The same woman who warned me that I may have a genetic predisposition towards alcoholism because her dad did, but then got back at me any way she could for how her dad mistreated her when that turned out to be true.

My dad fortunately recognized my recent hypo episode and has become supportive and admitted he doesn’t know enough to make that kind of judgment. My mom, though, I still won’t tell her how I’m feeling, and she acted totally unfazed when it came up that I was getting 3hrs sleep and working 60hrs/week and clearly had the forced speech and other symptoms I was trying to hide. I find myself so angry at her for not only being unsupportive and attacking my difficulties, but mostly for going out of her way to challenge a diagnosis I wasn’t even defending and to have the gall to diagnose me with the help of another woman I’ve never met.

I give grace to my dad, even if he could have helped more or learned enough to recognize my symptoms. My mom’s behavior though, feels unforgivable, if she was even aware and decent enough to ask for it. Is anyone else dealing with family’s denial, making you feel bad for thinking you have something a doctor told you that you have, pointing to your difficulties as personal failures? How do you move on? Do you just not talk about it with them? Do you maintain respect for them?

2025-10-19 01:44:16;My BP ex asked to meet up for coffee last night, and double-downed on our breakup, and the wound is fresh again and twice as big (religious components);"Context:

Me: 35M

Her: 32F, diagnosed BP since she was ~13/14

We met on Tinder in March, after she got out of a relationship, she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship but we started talking as friends, got to know each other, got closer, in May she said she was ready to date again, I asked her out, we went pedal to the medal very fast over the next 3 months. We lovebombed each other. We talked about getting married and our future together, I even ended up buying a ring, we made plans, and everything. I was at her house with her family virtually every day, she met my family when we flew out back to my home, we had trips together. I loved who she was. I didn’t see her as a diagnosis, but I wanted to learn and understand more of it, to keep loving her better. I didn’t see her as a statistic. I fell in love with *her*. 

One of the really big things I’m grateful for, is that being with her and interacting with her family, brought me back around to my faith. I had been turned away from the church for the last 20-25 years. In the last few weeks of the relationship, I started looking into religion more, and since the breakup I’ve been deep back into the Catholic faith I was raised in. I’m back in Mass, signed up for Bible Study, got myself a rosary and a crucifix. There was a period of time where I was worried if it was all performative, like, “oh well she’s religious and wants to convert to Catholicism so if i get back into it, then that’ll just line up perfectly”. But now, as I’m typing this, I feel secure and grounded in my renewed faith. 

2 months ago, she started talking about breakup thoughts she was having. She was starting to think she wasn’t ready for a relationship, and had things she needed to work on within herself. We tried talking and working it out but they kept coming up. She broke up with me a month ago. Said she just was not ready to be in a relationship and she’s so sorry she hurt me. What she felt for me was real, but she did not mean for the relationship to end up the way it did. 

Well, I messed up this week, and I sent her mom a text. My intention with the text was to just thank her mom for allowing me into their home. I also wanted to ask her mom for some wisdom , I guess in so many words, I wanted to check on my ex, to see where she was emotionally, because I ultimately would’ve loved to reach back out maybe to be friends 

A couple days went by and my ex reached out. Said she and her mom talked about the text, and my ex thought it’d be best if we met up for coffee to talk. 

We met up last night. She said she read the text I sent to her mom and thought it was very kind and sweet, She thought I was trying to get back together. I told her no. Even in my grief, I’ve known that she and I were not ready to be in a relationship as we were. I’ve never had a chance to tell her, though, that my wish would be for us to come together, figure out what we need together, and work on things together. 

She told me she did not want me to hold onto any hope that she and I could get back together. She said she’s very happy being single right now. Said it’s opening up so much clarity for her. Said she’s really focusing on staying single and figuring out who she is, and what she wants. She’s said she needs to just spend a long long time single, to focus on herself and getting closer with God. 

She said we probably wouldn’t have worked out anyway, because of some “fundamental personality differences”, and when she listed them, they were things that (A) I’ve been aware of for years, and (B) I had already begun working on before the breakup. I didn’t tell her last night everything I had been working on. 

I didn’t push back at all. Now, in hindsight, I wish I could’ve. But that’s probably the pain talking. 

She said she feels like she made a mistake by going on Tinder in the first place, back in March, because she probably wasn’t ready for a relationship back then. But she met me. And we hit it off. 

She said that in the heat of the relationship , she was certain she had met her husband. But then, I don’t know, she realized that none of this is what she wanted. 

She also said, last night, that she does not see us returning to being friends anytime soon. Not that the door is closed forever, just not on her radar right now. She says there’s too much tied up. But then she also said if down the line, I wanted to meet up again for coffee or something, she’d be down. 

I’m absolutely torn up. I was lucid the entire time and I knew I wanted to marry her. She’s kept saying this entire time that it’s nothing to do with me, I’m a great guy, she holds so many compliments on me, she fell in love with the ways I loved her but she just couldn’t fall in love with me. She said that when she thinks of me being hurt by the breakup, she hurts for me, but she is not hurt by the breakup. 

I’m just trying to make sense of this all. I can’t let her go. I know I’m still raw and fresh in the hurt so I probably haven’t given myself enough amount of time. I regret texting her mom. 

One of the things I’ve been actively trying to work on, is relinquishing control, and trusting that God has something better lined up for me. I’ve just been so used to living in fear, when I was away from God, that no one had my back so I had to have my own back. So I became obsessed with controlling every little detail of my life, and it became very apparent in my relationships, especially in this one, and especially in this breakup. If I just say this, if I just do that, maybe this is a BP discard and she’ll regret this whole thing in a couple weeks to a couple months and come back and be incredibly sorry, maybe she doesn’t really mean this breakup and her nervous system just got mad triggered and she just needs to come down, maybe this, maybe that 

In this very early stage of my grief, I can’t yet let go that we are meant to be. I know I’m hurting and in serious pain, and all I want is just to be physically seen by someone, and just to break down in tears with someone. 

Please help. I’m an anxious mess today. My leg hasn’t stopped bouncing since I woke up in a panic at 4:30am. Which is the exact time I’ve been waking up all week, regardless of when I go to bed.

She answered that it is impossible to mask bipolarity and surely I noticed something was off, and I kept telling her no.

Is it true that you can't mask bipolarity ? Or was I just too ignorant

I don't know how to cope with this. I don't like it. I'm a preschool teacher and I'm scared if parents find out I'm bipolar they might be uncomfortable. 

I am also in the process of moving in with my fiancé after months of planning to get our apartment, and I'm happy we got it..he knows I'm bipolar and he is very understanding and accepting so that's not the issue. I'm just embarrassed. I knew I had manic episodes (it's been obvious for at least two decades now) and I knew my brain wasn't always working right...it's probably not working properly right now either.

2025-10-18 23:11:40;Losing friends;How do you deal with losing friends after diagnosis? When I was in the psych ward I reached out to my best friend at the time, and thinking she would be supportive. She just stopped talking to me, I haven't heard from her since. Her mom was the one who has mostly checked up on me every now and then. But I still wonder why she stopped talking to me after 14 years of friendship, maybe we out grew each other since we are only in our 20s. I have only one friend who has been there for me since being diagnosed with BP1. She even wanted to visit me in the psych ward. I often feel like other people I thought were friends, weren't really friends I could talk with and I felt like most of these people only liked me when I was manic because I was so outgoing and talkative. Now I talk to no one except for my friend who visited me in the hospital, we consider ourselves each other best friends now. But being alone in your 20s as a woman feels really hard to make friends. ;r/bipolar;11;9;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1o9yd2j/losing_friends/
2025-10-18 22:24:13;Slipping into mania;"Throwaway account to read more about such topics.
I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II. about two years ago at 19 years of age, and have been seeing a psychiatrist every 3 months. Also have been to therapy on and off. Been taking mood stabilizers first, which did not help on itself, so got on a gradually increased dose of antidepressants, which I stopped taking a few months ago. With all the exams it felt like it was just making it harder for me to perform, which is right now the most important.
I also met my wonderful boyfriend who I've been with for 8 months now, who has since also been diagnosed with Bipolar II. It's so refreshing to have a partner relate to me and be able to really help, and vica versa. 
I haven't had any suicidal thoughts for almost a year, and my anxiety has been well managed.

Now, it feels like it's all going to collapse on me. My brain has been feeling weird, not the depression kind of weird that I'm used to, but this ""I am going mad and going to ruin my life"" weird. I don't trust myself, and even though I am usually a really calm and cool-headed person, now every moment is a new impulse that is stronger than the last. Every second I have thoughts about just throwing it all away, this restlessness, that I need to move away and start all over. 

The thing is, for the first time ever - it's all going well and I have it figured out. University, social life, work, goals, everything. And yet it's all so fragile.

Every therapist I had has told me how ""my bipolar"" is more depression-heavy, and that I'm switching between weeks of fairly ""normal"" and months of depressed. I know depression, but I am so deeply afraid of a maniac episode.

If anyone knows the feeling I'm talking about and could just share a little bit of insight, I would be more than honored.

2025-10-18 21:02:28;Starting over at 30;"About to turn 30 soon and can't help but feel like I need a change. I know you might think it's just me overthinking or being bored but I've been feeling this way for nearly 2 years so I'd really appreciate honest advice. 

I was diagnosed at 24 and spent most of my twenties since then healing and improving my life. So far, I'm happy to say I'm stable emotionally, mentally, and in almost all aspects of my life. I started my Master's degree around the same time I was diagnosed but had no problems finishing coursework. When I got to my thesis, I also started a new job as a high school teacher which was much more difficult and tiring than I had expected. Because of that, I had to pause my thesis work. However, the community I gained at the school I work at was a huge part of my healing and I am forever thankful for that. But now, it's been nearly 4 years and I'm still stuck on my thesis. I tried to quit my job to just focus on thesis writing but my bosses would not let go of me (unfortunately I became important at work lol) so we compromised by me taking a part-time role instead. I had also started a new thesis topic with a new adviser.

The problem is, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not really interested in getting my Master's degree anymore. Since I've healed, I feel like my priorities have shifted to living peacefully as though I've ""lost ambition"" in having a successful career. I renewed my thesis writing because I believed stopping meant ""failing"" and I didn't want to give up. But I know being a researcher is not something I see myself doing in the future. I would rather work a simple job that does not require a lot of mental load but is still helping other people. 

I know people in real life and online who have started over post 30s and I'm glad it worked out for them but there's still fear inside me to do it myself. There's a mental barrier I can't get over of leaving my past self behind. I feel like everything can go wrong especially with the job market right now. Even if I make a plan, there's no certainty of what will happen. At the same time, I'm excited to start fresh. It's like I'm waiting for permission to live my life after managing this disorder.";r/bipolar2;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o9v7nw/starting_over_at_30/

This all went downhill with an overdose that put me into this state of panic and depression that made me physically ill, suicidal. Switched ssris and it somehow got worse. I have been like this for 10 months while trying to get on the ssris at different doses. The only little bit of relief i had was in between ssris but I was still not well.
I feel extreme anxiety and extreme depression at the same time,I cant rest, cant distract myself, cant eat, I cant sleep without meds and often when I do sleep I wake up repeatedly and have weird stress dreams the wake up really early and feel intense unease and agitation while i lie in bed. I have the same part of a song that loops on my head on repeated for days at a time including in my sleep, and is there when I wake up. My mind races with anxious thoughts focused on what the hell is wrong me, what do I do to get better etc. I cannot shut my brain up it bounces around between every anxious thought I have.

I sob uncontrollably all day, im desperate to die because I cant bear feeling like this anymore. I feel this intense tension in my chest that gets hot. I go between curling in the foetal position sobbing to walking around my room hitting myself in the head or wanting to scratch myself until i bleed. I stopped lexapro 10days ago after trying to push through for 7 weeks, at first the anxiety was awful but I could just bear it. Then my mood drops and I become almost hysterical and suicidal. Im still feeling like this 10 days after stopping. Im hugely anxious about medications now after how unwell I became and its just feeding whatever is going on. When I go on leave I cry because I cant handle seeing normal people living normal lives with their kids and family because I feel like a broken freak who is losing everything that matters.

I have a girlfriend (16F), and ever since we've got together, I've been actually improving a lot. My suicidal thoughts have definitely decreased, I'm more motivated, I take my medication, and I've being working super hard on being stable for her.

But when I scroll through r/BipolarSOs I feel like I'm destined to become another story on that sub. Everyone there speaks so negatively about the bipolar people in their lives. I'm not saying their concerns and complaints aren't valid, because they 100% are. Being bipolar doesn't excuse your actions when they hurt others. But I feel like I never see any positivity. It seems like every person who's ever dated someone with bipolar has been abused and mistreated.

Am I destined to become one of those people? I fear every single day that I'll hurt my girlfriend in some way, by accident or intentionally.

2025-10-18 10:26:06;bipolar or misdiagnosed?;"Hi everyone,

I have followed this community for some time but always been a little anxious to actually share my story & ask questions so thank you in advance. 
3 years ago I was having the most challenging season of my life to date: 

I was working a job with a very toxic work environment where I was being harassed daily (it didn’t start out that way of course)
I was on the brink of divorce from my then husband, after over a year of couples therapy & individual therapy. 

Medication wise I was diagnosed with adhd at age 8 
And had been off & on stimulants for my whole life, majority of the time I was on something even if at a low dosage. After struggling with what doctors thought was SAD, I was put on Lexapro and was on that for around a year with no issues. 
And lastly I had my medical card for about 2 years at this point but because life was hard& my coping strategies weren’t working I was definitely over doing it with smoking and not just using it for anxiety. 

Due to not being able to get in to see a doctor & get a refill & financial constraints & just plain dumb avoidance I stopped taking my meds & stopped smoking. This led to me quitting my job (not abruptly I might add, long time coming & had been interviewing other places) and finally standing firm on getting out of my marriage. I moved back in with my parents, and overwhelmed by all the chaos I had back to back panic attacks & my family was very fearful (had never seen one before) I went to the ER and that led to me being in a psychiatric hospital for almost 3 weeks. Most horrifying experience of my life to date, I remember being injected with seroquel & god knows what else and experiencing hallucinations & for sure psychosis. Also was on Risperdal and way too much Ativan. I came away from that with bipolar 1 diagnosis and feeling like they had stripped every part of my personality away in the process. I was a shell of my past self for quite some time. Everything gave me anxiety, I mean seriously everything, I was completely numb, a good part of my memories were missing and I just felt awful. Fast forward to now, I had been med compliant since that episode and I’ve tried a ton of meds offered to me but most the side effects were too much to deal with & they didn’t seem to do anything positive. 

I’ve been stuck on lithium for about a year and a half, I started at 900 mg, and now I’m down to 300 mg and that is the only medication “treating” my bipolar. 

Ive been skeptical of my diagnosis for some time, but after having a medication induced seizure at work :( & losing my license for 6 months I am reassessing my actual need for these meds. At the time I was on Wellbutrin as well but I’m off it now. 

I know it’s not uncommon for those with a BP1 diagnosis to be in denial or resistant to treatment but for me I truly don’t think that’s the case… I just think trauma/life events/ ceasing meds& medical marijuana sparked psychosis or something of that nature and it was an isolated event. I have also tried 5 different medications. I’m just struggling because my psychiatrist is fine with with the low dosage I’m at now and has been remarking how I don’t seem manic or depressed or anything and I really just wanna go off lithium all together because of all the side effects & having to be on a thyroid medication from it. 

I’m sorry I know this a long post so I appreciate anyone taking the time to read ❤️I just need support, and to hear that I’m not alone in these these thoughts & that there are others out there who have been misdiagnosed and/or had  success being med free & bringing that conversation up with psychiatrist. I tend to be avoidant & anxious and I know at the end of the day I could just stop taking it myself but I’m just scared. Hoping that  someone that’s been with the diagnosis a little longer or who’s more knowledgeable can give me more insight.

2025-10-18 08:40:02;Long term remission?;"Long story short, I was formally diagnosed with Bipolar 1 three years ago after one hell of a manic episode (although it was clear it was present longer and bounced around with medical professionals that I had bipolar but was essentially told I was too “successful”- I hold a professional job, masters degree and dismissed because of this). I’ve had 0 episodes of depression or mania since. Can it possibly be that simple as getting on one med (no trial or error, really other than tried one before but had akathasia, switched to another and been fine since). I keep reading horror stories and am waiting for the other shoe to drop. My grandpa had it and died by suicide. He was always in and out of mental health treatment. 

I made a ton of lifestyle changes (no more substance use, sleep tracking, therapy, etc). I know I should be grateful, but I see people spending YEARS finding the right medication and still not finding complete stability. 

Now I’m constantly worried it will all go away. Anyone else have prolonged remission with Bipolar 1?

Anyways, I have tried Klonopine as well as Antipsychotics in the past and had no real improvement. Tried all SSRIs and stimulants as well but the only one that makes me feel a little better is Zoloft.

Currently, trying to find a concoction that helps even a little bit especially with the bipolar and tics. 

My doctor just prescribed me Vraylar. I will be taking 100mg of Zoloft with it, along with a bunch of vitamins (other health issues), Spironolactone 100mg, and a few stomach meds (other issues).

I found that 100mg Zoloft works okay when I have it combined with other medications. Anything more than that makes me feel more depressed. Doctor says to stay at 100mg of the Zoloft, add in the Vraylar and continue everything else.

Wondering if this combo works for anyone and if anyone else is on something like spiro too. My BP reads okay, as of now. However, I have a million electrolyte issues that are constantly monitored.

2025-10-18 07:37:57;This helped me see my episodes in a new light;"When I was growing up, I was scared of being judged. I always wanted people to like me, to see me for who I really was. But when I got my diagnosis, that fear only got worse. Suddenly, being bipolar felt like something that would define me, like I’d lost my chance to ever just be me.

But as I got older, I realized something important: everyone gets judged. No matter who you are, what you do, or how hard you try, people will always have opinions. It’s part of being human. And somehow, that realization set me free.

Because here’s the thing, my manic episodes, as wild and messy as they are, have shown me what it’s like to be completely fearless. To stop caring what anyone thinks. To just be. It’s chaotic, it’s not controlled, but it’s also powerful.

And when those episodes pass, I’m left with small pieces of that courage. Each time, I understand myself a little more. Each time, I hold onto a bit more of that fearlessness.

So yeah, my bipolar disorder can be difficult. It can be exhausting. But it also teaches me something beautiful, that even in the chaos, there’s growth. That out of everything that feels broken, a little bit of bravery is born.

My manic self dances where my quiet self hesitates, and somewhere between them, I’m learning what real courage feels like.";r/bipolar;16;6;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1o9gqjx/this_helped_me_see_my_episodes_in_a_new_light/

I am also on: fluoxetine and Vyvanse

2025-10-18 00:21:06;Advice after very public psychotic break;"This is gonna be a long one, but I really need to get it out.

Last winter, I had a full-blown psychotic episode. Like… the kind where you absolutely lose touch with reality and spiral into a whole other dimension of meaning and delusion and cosmic messages and archetypes and paranoia and spiritual missions and destiny.

I didn’t realize I was sick at the time—I genuinely believed I had been chosen by a spiritual council to become the “Queen of America” and that I was the reincarnation (or reawakening?) of Immanuel Kant. Yes. The philosopher. I was emailing law schools and professors and professional organizations telling them this, thinking I was unveiling a deeper truth or fulfilling some prophecy. I was completely untethered.

I aired out the entire break *in public*.  
I posted unhinged things on Instagram stories—stuff about spiritual warfare, about being chosen, about enlightenment. My coworkers, law school professors, bar associations, and literal judges followed me.

I sent emails that ranged from embarrassing to insulting to just completely incoherent. I messaged people on LinkedIn—like judges I respected—with truly psychotic rambles.  
One day I even stormed into a courthouse (I’m a lawyer, btw) wearing almost pajamas, made a scene, and left. Like… I *know* I was sick. But that doesn’t stop me from waking up at 3AM months later, remembering it, and wanting to crawl out of my body.

Fast forward:  
I got hospitalized. Then I went to residential. Then I did outpatient. I got diagnosed, I got on meds, and I’ve been stable for months now. I’m working again. I’m doing well. I’m in a healthy marriage. I’m back to practicing law, and my life is honestly going better than it ever has.

I’m scared that:

* People in my field still remember.
* I permanently ruined my reputation.
* Every time someone hears my name, they think of that episode.
* No matter how hard I work, I’ll never fully escape “crazy girl” status in some people’s eyes.

But I also *know* that what happened to me wasn’t my fault. My brain broke. I was carrying too much for too long and something snapped. I’ve done the work to get better. I’m not in denial. I’m not fragile. I’m just trying to live a full, grounded life after having *completely lost touch with reality* in front of an audience.

**My questions:**

* How do you *cope with the shame* of a very public psychotic break, especially when you did or said things that were embarrassing, cringey, or professionally risky?
* Do people actually remember and judge, or is that mostly in my head?
* How do you rebuild confidence in yourself after completely unraveling?
* How do you not let the past version of you (the sick one) define the current, healthier version of you?

I’m not ashamed of having bipolar or psychosis. I’ve actually come to *love* talking about it in safe spaces. It completely changed how I see the world. It made me softer, stronger, and a lot more interesting tbh. But I’m still scared sometimes. Still worried I’ll never live it down. Still learning how to forgive myself for things I did when I was very, very unwell.

**TL;DR:**

I am a current college student living with bipolar II. I was diagnosed at the age of 18 and have been medicated for a bit now. I'm looking to talk to other college students who struggle with bipolar disorder and get some advice on ""doing"" college life. I have taken a health leave to work on med management, but I still have been feeling like getting my degree might not be possible between the mood instability and college stress.

2025-10-17 23:06:49;How do I get over my parents holding a grudge against me;"I’m 26 now and recently diagnosed Bipolar with suspected OCD. 
I was insane as a child. I had symptoms start before age 10, and had my first depressive episode at 14. I was always doing something stupid and embarrassing my family because I just didn’t know what was going on or what to do. 
I tried telling them I was having trouble and was just told mental illness doesn’t exist and that I had nothing to be so depressed about and I needed to quit being a bitch. Obviously this didn’t help and caused other issues but that’s not what i’m worried about right now. 
My problem is, it’s obvious they hold a grudge against me from my childhood. I’ve told them I was diagnosed bipolar and my mom is trying to think of every reason why i’m not, and my dad hasn’t said a word to me about it. 
My main issue with them and why I think they hold a drudge is because of my kids. 
When I got pregnant with my first child, before I knew he was a boy, I was told by them multiple times “better hope it’s not a girl, you know how you were”. This comment continued for 4 years. I have two boys now and they just can’t stop talking about how lucky I am to not have had a girl. I finally worked up the courage to say something and my mom just said well i’m sorry. My dad still hasn’t said a word to me about it. 
I think the point of my post is, since they obviously don’t forgive me, how can I get past this? Seeing them stresses me out quite a bit but cutting them off isn’t so easy, my kids love them dearly.

2025-10-17 21:54:32;i don’t know what i am;i recently started a new therapist program to aid with my anorexia diagnosis from the beginning of the year. i was 14 when i was diagnosed with clinical depression and have been on meds for it since. since talking to my new therapist we started medication for B1 after telling her about my hypermania episodes but now i’m beginning to doubt if i am actually bipolar or not. my hypermania never lasts long and is never as climactic as i desperately need it to be. my head sounds like a vacuum cleaner of thoughts, any ‘risky’ thing outside of my own company and room i am able to talk myself out of. i feel like i can’t do any of the things that I want to do when i feel like this and as soon as it’s over i spend weeks incredibly irritable, full of rage at this pent up emotions that i didn’t act on and so depressed i’m unable to get out of bed or do anything except cry. i’ve never had a doctor diagnose me with anything that felt right until B1 but now i feel like i’m making it up and it’s just depression and medication side effects. but i am so scared to be off medication because it’s been so long i don’t know what to expect. is there any advice for what to expect on lamotragine/ anyone that can help with these mixed feelings? ;r/BipolarReddit;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o91yr4/i_dont_know_what_i_am/

2025-10-17 14:12:30;Rediagnosed;"4 years of being diagnosed Bipolar 1 and being on various cocktails of medication has been... harrowing. My (21M) worst enemies are Epilim, Zyprexa, and Prystiq. Absolutely hated them. Couldn't work, gained so much weight, fucked up my libido, and made me extremely suicidal. I thought that after a single psychiatrist reviewed me and told me that they had to be right. They weren't. I finally decided to get a second opinion, and this doc said that my last one was known to over medicate. Various friends who sought help from my last doc said that they were cold and clinical, dosing them up with every medication under the sun. My new doc scrapped all my old prescriptions, didn't matter anyways because I wasn't even taking them. I'm now on 2 meds. Lamictal and Intuniv. 4 diagnosed illnesses; Bipolar II, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Social Anxiety. 2 meds. Now that's not to say that there won't be more in the future, but I am experiencing NO negative side effects. I haven't had an episode in 2 months. I've been sober for 3. I've been more confident and sociable, don't hate my body, and have been so much more calmer and collected. I'm working now after being unemployed for more than a year. I still deal with interpersonal issues with my Favourite Person (a BPD term I have come to learn and understand); but her also being BPD has made it more bearable, as she understands it better. I was diagnosed BP1 after a misdiagnosed psychotic episode, which I now believe to be a panic attack and subsequent break down (don't ask me, doctors see things that others don't, good or bad). I'm not cured by any means, but now life feels a little more bearable, maybe even enjoyable. If your treatment isn't working for you, there is no harm in a second opinion. You deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not like a statistic or lab rat. It's not hopeless. Love yourself, love others, and let them love you.

2025-10-17 13:20:30;My bipolar best friend has really awful communication skills and it’s started to make me feel extremely frustrated;"To start I’ll say that I’m not entirely sure if I’m allowed to post here as this is about a friendship rather than a romantic relationship. 

I would like some help navigating if this is a regular occurrence with people with bipolar. My best friend (and essentially sibling with the amount of time we spend together) of 8.5 years was very recently diagnosed with bipolar, I’d like to add that they are also diagnosed with ADHD too (this is a long standing diagnosis)(they are medicated for ADHD and have started getting medicated for bipolar but it’s at the beginning stage so they are not sure if the medication is helping yet). 

Through the beginning years of our friendship communication seemed fine (granted this was in high school so my memory might be a bit shit). I’ve noticed however in the past few years though that slowly their ability to communicate has gotten worse and worse. A recent week and a half period of not getting any contact from them despite me checking in with them (both mental health check ins and random messages) has really left me feeling frustrated. When they finally did “respond” to this string of messages they didn’t acknowledge anything I said and simply asked if I have seen a T-shirt of theirs. I’m trying my best to be understanding and sympathetic but it’s starting to just edge of the side of rudeness from my perspective. 

I’m currently trying to organise festival tickets that they are very enthusiastic about going to but they haven’t been able to respond at all and I am getting to the end of my rope. 

I’d like to add that her other close friend (and mine too) has been experiencing similar patchy convos from them but to a worse degree. I think what upsets me as well is I know first hand they can consistently communicate, as we went away for a week and they were able to ring their partner every night that we were away. 

One more thing to add is their daily schedule is relatively chill, they live at home still with their parents who still do a lot from them (given their age) and they don’t have a full time job, just a casual job that they have a few shifts a week for. 

This might be coming across a bit bitchy but I am trying to gauge if this is a common among bipolar people and if I need to be more understanding/how to be more understanding. 

Any advice would be really helpful, thank you. ";r/BipolarSOs;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o8stb1/my_bipolar_best_friend_has_really_awful/
2025-10-17 13:16:45;selfawareness in manic and depressive episodes;"Two years ago, I (29F) was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I have a balance of meds that works well for me and I see a therapist weekly. 

The past couple of months I’ve become increasingly self aware of when I’m in my manic or depressive states. I’m learning how to take care of myself when I’m experiencing a high or a low until I’m back in my steady “normal” state. But I feel so frustrated, upset, and hopeless by the lack of control I have over when I enter and exit a manic period or a depressive one. 

I struggle with the reality that this will be something I will always live with. At this moment in my journey, the self awareness while I’m manic or depressed is crushing. It’s like this switch in my body that I have no control over and I simply have to wait it out until it passes, which I never know when that will be. 

Can anyone relate? The self awareness of when I’m in a high or low is part of the journey, but right now I’m upset that I can’t be in a “normal” stable state all the time. I feel like I have no control over my mind.

2025-10-17 07:44:30;Improvement is Possible;"Unsurprisingly, most of the posts in this sub highlight struggles and feature those looking for answers and support. I just wanted to drop my story in here to maybe provide a little hope. 

I was late diagnosed with major depressive disorder in my mid-30s. I was completely shocked at the diagnosis because, as many of us experience, the feelings of depression that come with that side of bipolar disorder seem like every day life (because they are). It took me months to process that my reality was being skewed by a mental disorder. I was a high functioning adult who had been self medicating with heavy alcohol from age 17 until that point (I know now that alcohol supercharged my mania). Naturally with a MDD diagnosis I was prescribed antidepressants. I did some ketamine treatments and chilled for a few months until my (hopefully one and only) manic episode took place. 

I spent a ton of real money on depreciating collectibles and opened and maxed out several high limit credit cards to buy as much as I could over the period of a month thinking I had corned the market other inexplicable and illogical things. My wife saw the items coming in, but really had no clue on the volume or cost. It wasn’t until I tried to borrow $50k from my dad that someone realized that something wasn’t right. I think my wife had become numb to my drinking and night owl behavior at that point. 

I was directed to a new psychiatrist who immediately diagnosed me as bipolar type 1 and changed my meds. I quickly fell into a severe period of feeling suicidal and being institutionalized for the same. I ended up at another facility for a period of six months where my meds were tweaked and tweaked and I end up gaining 45 lbs and was obese for the first time in my life. Even though I felt “better” my life was changed for ever. I had no idea where the disorder started and where I began. What was bipolar and what was me? (A question I still struggle with daily).

I have a professional degree and my line of work is not one that has a lot of wiggle room for self contemplation. I have to be on my game at all times. I decided as soon as I got out to quit drinking and start training for a marathon because I knew I wouldn’t be able to run in the morning if I was hungover. My children and marriage were all I could think of and I had come so close to losing them and/or leaving this world entirely. 

This all started almost three years ago.

Since then, I have found a medication mix that helps me manage whatever the hell bipolar is, I have lost over 60 lbs., ran 5 marathons, still haven’t had a drop of alcohol and have a new job where I’ve been promoted twice. 

I’m still trying to decipher between me and the disorder and I realize it could be just a matter of time until my next episode. But, until then, I am going to continue to do everything I possibly can to enjoy the hell out of the good times and give myself the best opportunity to make them last.

2025-10-17 07:41:05;Seeking anecdotes (because every case is different, after all) for the process of adding Lithium;"I’m really happy to be lining up to add Lithium to my cocktail, but about to start a new job, and I’m curious about other peoples experiences. 

In the interview, I learned company give 5 “bugger it” days in addition to sick and annual leave, for when you, quote, “just think, bugger it, I can’t do this today”. 

I took a leap of faith and disclosed my diagnosis.  The main boss said, yeah, I have a serious heart condition. We make allowances for each other. 

It sounds like they’re going to be great to work for, maybe I can balance doing my job vs maybe losing balance for a bit, and wondering what it could look like if I do have a rough time starting Lithium. 

I’m relatively stable right now, so there’s no rush, just a hope that I can be less “off” than I’ve been for the last few years. 

I’m very aware that everyone responds differently, but I’m curious about speed of change (if it’s slow, I could start maybe start titrating before taking a long long weekend), what it can be like if it doesn’t go well, etc. 

For once, feel free to share your horror stories, lol. It won’t or me of trying, just the time frame.

2025-10-17 05:26:36;Coparent with BPD Spouse;"I need help. My recently diagnosed parter has BPD and we officially cut things off almost two months ago. He no longer lives here and he is working on getting treatment etc. he has very highs and low lows and I been doing my best to give grace but the last six months have been very trying since he was in a manic episode. We know this now after doing a lot of research. He has been very angry. And then forgiving. One moment i am the devil and was a shit wife for not being more supportive. Moments where he says he is sorry for not being a good husband.

It’s been very hard… well. This past month we tried working on reconciliation but it’s not working at all. So we try then go no contact. He goes against boundaries a lot and one day he loves me. Another he doesn’t. I now shut down and tell him to keep things clean and professional with no personal disputes. We aren’t able to have any just cordial conversations. He has put low effort with the kids and hasn’t been coming around he just started his meds and things have somewhat improved. But not really.

For context I have two kiddos from a previous relationship and for the past month he has disowned them. Keeps claiming that he is no longer responsible for them and they aren’t his and that he doesn’t want them around anymore. And that he doesn’t like them. It’s been so hurtful and I just keep letting it go. But he is not living here. So I’m no longer subjecting them to have to be around him if they don’t need to be.

Today he wants to take all the kids to go to a volleyball game. (Which our twins are three. They won’t enjoy it. And the older kids who aren’t his don’t want to go and they feel like he doesn’t like them which. Who blames them ) and he wanted to coordinate. I sent the following

I’m a little concerned about the big kids going tonight. I just want to make sure you all have a good time and I’m a little uncomfortable with them going knowing that you’re not necessarily in like with them. How can we discuss this so I feel more comfortable with them attending tonight.

He then responded with

I like them? You should talk to them and let them know we aren’t in the same space anymore so not to act nonchalant or indifferent. If that’s not doeable then I’ll just take the twine

I was going to go into validating my concerns but I have learned very fast that it’s a waste of time. I was hoping he would say something like “I know I said some out of pocket things in the last month but I love all our girls and I want to spend time with them”

He didn’t. So I simply responded with okay I’ll have the twins packed tonight.

He then said sounds good and then called me bitch ass.

So now I’m just feeling frustrated. I just need support or advice. For five years I let him be a tyrant in our home. I feel like this is the first time I actually stood up for my kids and I refuse to subject them to be in the presence of someone who just is ugly. He has made it clear he has no intention in being kind. Overall I’m just hurt.";r/BipolarSOs;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o8isxl/coparent_with_bpd_spouse/
2025-10-17 05:16:22;I hate therapy;"And at this point I dont think it can help me.

For background: I am 29NB and american, and was diagnosed for the 5th time with Bipolar II this year (the first 4 times I did not believe it and chose to stay unmedicated.... which was the wrong choice lets just say)

The first time I went to individual talk therapy I was 13yo and self harming (cutting), but I only went for 2 sessions (mom's decision). After spending some time as a young adult no-contact with my parents (thats another story... we are better now and there is much love), I decided to start therapy again. From 19-23 I was pretty on-and-off with it, and had maybe 2 different therapists that didnt really work out: one who crossed some professional boundaries and talked about herself and her personal life too much, another who was the best therapist I ever had, but moved to another practice that doesnt take my insurance.

From 24-present, I've had 8 different therapists... all not working out, and several who were really unprofessional and crossed serious ethical boundaries. One therapist (the worst one) let me call or text her personal phone 24/7.... which might sound dope at first but it created such a resentment between us that it was actually a traumatizing experience for me.

This year, Ive started seeing a therapist who is the director of operations at a clinic that specializes in traumatic stress... that should mean she's the best right?

Ive been explicitly upfront with her that I really need coping skills to be able to deal with entering the workforce again after two recent mental health hospitalizations (we all know about dbt coping skills, right?).... its been almost 3 months and I have yet to learn a single one. Outside of session, I feel anxious, vulnerable, and unprepared.... therapy used to ruin my whole day after, now it ruins the rest of my week.

During session I cant concentrate, because I dont see how the information the therapist is droning on about is relevant or will help me learn these coping skills.... I let her know that I really just need coping skills taught to me like in iop, its that simple (I tried to go to iop for a 2nd time this year but the new director redesigned the curriculum and now its an unorganized nightmare and really stressed me out while there).

I will cry, scream, get angry, and beg for her to teach me these coping skills... and its just not happening and I dont understand why not....

I feel so disappointed because I want this to work, and its not. This is not the first therapist in the past several years who can not teach me coping skills.. Ive had some refuse outright,  which I dont understand.

Its also an incredible inconveniece every week: the therapist is in another city than me, so we always have to do telehealth... and that comes with a video or audio issue every. single. time. 
My therapist being the clinic director, she sometimes has to cancel our sessions short notice to deal with emergencies... which is inconvenient. I also work 9-5 and sessions end at 3pm... so my therapist has to schedule me outside of her normal tour hours, and I have to have my therapy session in my car in the parking lot across the street from my work.

I have sadly asked chat gpt to help me learn dbt coping skills.... which I really want to find an alternative, bc I recognize the dangers of that... But I feel like I have no choice at this point if I want to survive and get better, than to do this by myself.

TLDR/  therapy just doesnt seem worth it anymore..";r/bipolar2;4;5;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o8ijl6/i_hate_therapy/
2025-10-17 04:51:46;I’m having the hardest time navigating this breakup from my BPSO (Religious components) (Super long read, I’m sorry);"

Me: 35M, Dumpee

Her: 32F, Dumper, BP, medicated

We met on Tinder back in March. At the time, she was fresh out of the relationship. She told me so. She also told me upfront that she had BP but that she was stable and on a good course of medication. She said she was only on Tinder for validation, post break-up, but that I seemed really nice and that I was cute but she wasnt ready to get into a relationship because she was too fresh out of her last relationship. I said, sure that’s totally fine. But I still thought she seemed cool so I offered to stick around as a friend to message each other periodically through Tinder. She said that sounded good and sweet. 

Over the next 2-3 months, we would talk more, learn more about each other, get closer, etc. 

Then, one day, she said “hey I think I’m good to move forward so if you wanted to ask me out, I’d be open”. So I asked her out. After our first date, I fell in love. I knew I had wanted to marry her. And she felt the same. 

We went super fast and super heavy. Within like 3 months, we had gone on a few dates, hooked up, said we loved each other, gone on a weekend getaway, we flew out of state for a trip where she met my family and also for her to get a tattoo, talked about getting married, I even bought a ring. 

Then, in the last month or so, she started talking about getting these “breakup thoughts”. She kept having these thoughts of “I don’t want to be here anymore”. We were sexually active but very guarded about it. Yeah we would have nights of sexting and she would send me photos, but the physical stuff was very limited on account of her living at home and us having boundaries of what we wanted our intimate encounters to be “nothing “trashy” like in a car or something”. Then, in that last mont , she said that her sex drive just plummeted and she wasn’t interested in sex at all. I just thought it was part of her cycle, as that was something she was always on top of, and something we would talk about. 

In regards to the “breakup thoughts”, we originally talked about it, we said “okay well maybe this’ll pass…let’s just talk it out, take things slow, we’ve been going super fast and spending virtually every moment together that we could”. 

A couple weeks went by, and we went out to dinner, and afterwards we were in the parking lot, she just broke down and broke up with me. She said she couldn’t shake those breakup thoughts anymore. She just felt overwhelmed, and felt like she was still processing her previous breakup (she would mention him a bunch, during our relationship, in a “he sucked, you’re so much better than him in all these ways” kind of way), she just started feeling trapped, and felt like she just needed to get out, and focus on herself, and get into a period of singleness, she wanted to work on personal projects, and focus on getting back closer to God. She came from a very religious family, and her faith has always been super important to her. We were sobbing and confused and trying to talk it out. I was confused and pleading. Ultimately we talked, and she happily said she’d be open to taking a break and revisiting 6 months down the road. Then, over the course of the next week, we went from “on a break for 6 months” to “on a break for 3 months” to “together but reassessing every month” to “together and taking it very slow”. We would decrease the frequency with which we would text (which, to be fair, was literally all day every day), and see each other, etc. I knew that we needed to take things much more slowly. I even said “hey, look, I know we were super excited about having this shotgun wedding but that’s clearly way too much for you to process so the wedding is off the table for now, I’m okay with tabling it (and I genuinely was). She thanked me and appreciated the work I was doing to accommodate her. We would check in, and she would say that taking things slower was working really well for her brain. She was feeling better, but  I just had this really uneasy feeling the entire time, though, like I felt like the breakup was just inevitable. 

Then, another week went by, I myself was getting into a rabbit hole about bipolar disorder, just reading into all kinds of horror stories and statistics. I kind of freaked out. I had wanted to see her and talk about it. She said she wanted to see me too. She was being all sweet and loving to me the whole day, calling me baby and saying she loved me and all that. So I didn’t feel like any danger was incoming. I picked her up and we went somewhere to talk. I started talking about what I was feeling and thinking, and she politely cut me off and said she needed to break up with me. 

It was a really hard conversation but I ultimately dropped her back off at home and went home. I called out of work the following day and just laid in bed all day. She and I had a text conversation the whole day, just talking about everything. She said she was just feeling trapped, and needed to just get back to herself. She said she can’t remember the last time she actually was able to be single for an extended period of time, and really wanted to just focus on herself and on getting closer to her faith, she felt incredibly sorry for me, but she just wasn’t ready to be in the relationship anymore, she was crying and everything. She never seemed cold or distant or anything. She told me she had zero plans to date or get intimate or have sex with anyone else for a “long, long” time. She called this her “sabbatical” to get back to herself and to God. 

While we were together, my door to faith and religion had opened back up after me being turned away for 20-25 years. Genuinely, not in a performative manner. 

It’s been a month since the break up and I’m just a mess. I’ve been getting into self-improvement (gym, therapy, lessons, church, men’s group, Bible study, etc) but I still just feel so lonely and I miss her so terribly. 

For the record, I never got the sense that her BP was unmanageable. She’s kept her job for a while without incidents, she has her own business, she’s a part of her family living at home, she has a daughter that she “co-parents” with her own mom, she has friends and hobbies, and interests. The only thing that was really of concern was her ability to keep herself fed and watered regularly. By that, I mean, she would *sometimes* gravitate towards super easy things to prepare/eat (smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, etc). She would eat just fine but every now and then, she’d have no energy to prepare anything…but I never found that to be too alarming…I mean, who amongst us *haven’t* felt that before? Who amongst us *haven’t* needed the occasional water check?

I’ll admit, I did fall into the caretaker/protector/giver role with her, as a way to “perform” for her and “earn” that love. In hindsight, I totally dug my own grave. 

But I just miss her so much. I’ve already learned so much about myself, about patience and grace and trust, etc. I’m just aching for a chance to try again and do it right this time. 

I miss her so much. I can’t bear the thought that this is just her bipolar at play, and this is just how she’s going to be forever, always unable to stay in a long-term committed relationship, having episodes of irresponsible decisions, etc. 

Granted, I wouldn’t want to just jump right into a relationship right off the bat, because I’d need to communicate my boundaries too. And also I’d want to respect hers. I’d want to reconnect on the basis of a friendship first. 

I have so much love and care for the person behind the diagnosis, and I never want to see her as just a diagnosis or a statistic. She’s a person. I can’t just discard her either. 

I want to have hope that she can still be part of my future, we can reconnect and rebuild a good pure loving chaste godly relationship, and that one day we can be married and live a long happy godly married life together. 

I want to respect her need for time and space and everything, but I still have that longing for her. I still want her in my life. I’ve been wrestling with the timeframes. How long should I be giving her for her feeling of overwhelm and “trapped” and high cortisol to settle back down? We’re already one month out from the initial breakup, so I give her another month? 2 months? 6 months? I know that the only person who could tell me would be *her* but then I’m afraid of reaching out too soon, her nervous system getting shocked again, and I send her back into that trapped state of mind again. 

My therapist has warned me about the dangers of being with someone who’s bipolar, but he’s also said “hey if you love this woman and you want her in your life, why *not* just reach out and say hi or whatever?”

I know I’m sounding ridiculous but I’m deep in my grief right now.

I am currently on lexipro 20mg, Wellbutrin 300 xl, prazosin, vyvanse 50 mg, and hydroxyzine idk the mg but honestly i can’t tell if these meds make me feel better i really feel worse and constantly all over the place. if anyone has any suggestions or tips that you think could help or worked for you i’d really appreciate it. ;r/BipolarReddit;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o8hx2i/i_need_a_routine_asap/
2025-10-17 03:33:24;This will be the end of me;"TL;DR:
Diagnosed BP1, now in some sort of mixed episode (since this pretty spot on: https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/how-diagnose-mixed-features-without-over-diagnosing-bipolar), worst one so far, I don't know what to do and have pretty much given up. Any advice or reassurance or similar stories might help. 

I've been involuntary inpatient for a week now but we haven't been able to come up with any kind of plan whatsoever. Nothing feels like it'll help soon enough (except perhaps ECT which they're hesitant to try again) and I really don't feel like anything else is even worth trying (again). I'm so fucking sick of everything. Myself, my life, this place, these people, everyone, pills, being sick, being alive. Very actively considering stopping that. 

Everytime we've tried to discuss options it has ended up with me either crying hysterically, hyperventilating, screaming, throwing things or hitting myself. Very unproductive. My impulse control is currently non-existent. Usually not an issue. Now very much so. Today I pretty much unprovokedly attacked another patient and yesterday I fractured my hand and possible my foot hitting a wall. I'm terrified of myself and so are others. 

May be worth mentioning that I have comorbid cPTSD and Autism which probably explains part of the hypervigilance and my ""meltdowns""

I'm currently back on lithium (started a week before being locked up) but the lowest dose which we will increase soon. They also give me lorazepam to take the worst edge off which helps a little but is just a temporary solution. Without it I'm in constant fight or fight mode, can't leave my room or talk to anyone without having a mental breakdown of some sort or breaking something.
Can't sleep without sleeping meds. Can't eat, talk or get anything done without benzos. On them I'm pretty fine though, almost ""normal"" (as normal as I get). As long as nothing triggers me or I'm alone with my thoughts. But as mentioned, just a temporary ""solution"" and not enough. 

Constantly restless, don't want to do anything - especially not nothing. Can't focus, make plans, decisions, solve problems, anything. Memory's shit and my sense of time is so off. Everything's too much yet nothing is enough. I want to scream more or less constantly, rip my eyes out, tear off my fucking skin. I cry and laugh hysterically at the same time. I can't hate myself enough. I feel like everyone tries to get rid of me and they should, still it makes me so extremely sad and I feel so disgustingly lonely in all of this since there's no one I can tell. It's like a fucking monster has taken control of me, that tries to ruin everything and everyone close to me and doesn't let me do anything to stop it and I need it out NOW. 

Tried before, not an option:
Aripiprazole, lurasidone, risperidone, cariprazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, lamotrigine

2025-10-17 01:26:38;My partner broke up with me and now I don’t know what I’m doing.;"After a horrible start to the year (my mother passed away) I met a girl at Easter and she made me incredibly happy from our first date. We started meeting after work almost daily, going for food, exchanging texts and gradually becoming more and more closer every day.

She was open from the start, she was diagnosed with bipolar in 2023 after an episode, I think she said experiencing mixed features. She’s had multiple partners before meeting, many bad experiences but now being on medication she’s over that and going to take things slowly. I wasn’t ready to jump into a relationship but I knew from the start I liked her a lot so both in agreement we’d go at a pace that suited both of us. 

We were both happy and comfortable with each other’s company, soon becoming exclusive then official. We’d always be happy together, if ever she felt overwhelmed or wanted her own space and felt the need to cancel I was happy to do so and rearrange. I’d do everything in my power to make her happy, drop in coffee at work, meet her after to go out or just chill at hers and make dinner. It felt right.

I had a family holiday in September so was away from her but we still remained in contact, I’d purposely wake up early because of the time difference just to wish her a good day because I’d do that without fail. We had a late night call after she was on a night out when she said she loved me as we were closing the call (I was shocked and asked what she said (the feeling was mutual) but she went quiet and that was the end of the call) 

I struggle with saying how I feel and I’ve been trying to bring this up since being back. Recently she’s had a couple of days where she’s felt worthless and obviously I reassure but something has been off. We had a disagreement a couple of weeks ago where I didn’t sleep well and when asked if I was ok I passed it off and said I felt fine. After walking her to work I felt bad so messaged to explain I didn’t sleep well, she didn’t talk to me after that and said she felt awkward. We met up a few days later and it felt like nothing had happened, usual cuddles, made dinner and watched films. She has forgotten to take her meds a couple of times but will never go more than 2 days without them.

Anyway, last Friday we went out to a gathering where I hadn’t seen people for a number of years and without realising at the time I neglected her, we later had a big argument and I apologised for everything but shouted at her for leaving. We didn’t talk on Saturday but met on Sunday where she said it’s over after almost 6 months, giving me back clothes and dismissing my apologies again. I finally brought up the call and her saying she loves me, saying that back to her before she said she didn’t remember what she said when she was drunk. We walked off, she hugged me but oddly said she doesn’t hate me as we departed.

I’m devastated, I’ve not eaten much this week, I’ve thought about her nonstop whilst trying to educate myself more on bipolar. I know sudden choices and decisions will be made and she’s had things happen before so probably has a short fuse with things like this but I was always told this is different, I’m not like others. I don’t know if she’s having or in an episode, I don’t know the signs but this isn’t like her! I’m so sad and worried and I miss her so much I can’t put into words.

I’m giving her space, I’ve written out a heartfelt apology, being direct, showing remorse and accountability whilst making her feel special but I don’t know if to send it. I really don’t want to lose her, we’ve done so much these past 6 months our feelings have matched throughout, she’s made me so happy and I feel I’ve made her that too.

I’m sorry for the big post, I struggle to say how I’m feeling and putting things into words so thank you for reading. Any opinions are greatly appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o8cg7q/my_partner_broke_up_with_me_and_now_i_dont_know/
2025-10-17 01:20:35;I need help to support my SO, I'm the one with bipolar;"I have bipolar 1, I am long-term medicated, in therapy, etc. I wouldn't say I'm 100% stable but I am worlds better than I used to be. I usually have 1-2 bad bouts of severe depression a year, and no mania, maybe a mixed episode once every year or two, but it's been quite manageable, relative to my first ten years diagnosed.


My girlfriend told me last night she worries about me committing suicide. In a depressive episode a long time ago, I guess I shared my worry that once my pets pass away, I'd be more likely to commit suicide during a depressive episode (because they're my world and have for over a decade been my tether to this world more than anything...). Recently, my dog died, one of my cats is palliative, and the other is kind of sickly. I haven't mentioned it and I haven't been thinking about it, but I guess she has.


I feel horrible. I never should have shared that with her. I told her I have no plan to do that immediately when my pets die, and that it is more of a worry that if I do get suicidal ideation during a severe depressive episode, it may be harder to get through without them. I also told her that I love her, and my friends, and my family, and I don't want to put anyone through that. Not to mention I'm nearly 40 and haven't done it yet despite decades of suffering and suicidal thoughts and such. I am fully disabled due to many psychiatric conditions, and physical conditions. I told her that even if I don't feel strong, I've survived so many things, including severe traumas, cancer, injuries, etc. and that must mean I am more resilient than I think. I also told her that maybe I will foster pets again, after mine are gone, and that would likely be a protective factor as well. I cried so much after I hung up, that she was carrying that burden because of me, and how unfair that was of me to ever place that on her.


I don't feel I can outright promise her I'll never commit suicide. That just feels like a lie. NOT because I am planning to, but simply because I know what this condition is and what it can do to the brain. I know I'm at risk, even if I am doing everything right. I told her all the things above, really hoping it might make her feel better, but I doubt it does. 


I want to find a way to help her, to help us, navigate this. I do not want to be a burden for her to carry. She's had enough of that in life. Please, SOs, what can I do to be a good partner when she's feeling like this? ";r/BipolarSOs;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o8ca9o/i_need_help_to_support_my_so_im_the_one_with/
2025-10-16 23:01:21;Lamotrigine and Vyvanse?;"Hey, y'all.

I was diagnosed with bipolar type ii at the start of the summer this year, and put on lamotrigine shortly after. After titrating up, I've been on 200mg (my psychiatrist's goal) for about 2 months. Everything is great. My depressive episode was so abnormally normal, and I kept waiting for it to get worse out of habit. It never did, and I couldn't believe it. No hypomanic episodes since July, either!

With that context, I have a question about stimulants. Vyvanse, to be hyperspecific. My father, my brother, and I are all diagnosed with ADHD. It has severely impacted my ability to focus on assignments (I'm in college) and complete tasks without awful procrastination. My best friend also has ADHD, and was prescribed Vyvanse. Everything flipped for him and it changed his life, I'm not joking. 

So when he offered me to try one of his pills, I obviously said yes. Now, before anyone gets concerned, let me explain what happened after.

I took it early in the morning one day, and when it kicked in my heart stopped racing and my mind was quiet for the first time in forever. My severe day-to-day anxiety was reduced to practically zero. I wasn't jittery or wired, but quite the opposite. The best word for it was calm. I was so calm, and instead of procrastinating I'd think, ""I should get up and go do those dishes!"" and immediately just get up to do it.

I've taken it three separate times (weeks apart) and never once did it cause hypomania, depression, or any increase in anxiety.

I told my therapist about this, the same one who diagnosed me, and she said I should bring this up with my psychiatrist if I believe it can help me. So I did. Her verbatim response was: bipolar people can't touch stimulants, ever. I felt really deflated, and did the annoying patient thing where I told her I've read (ugh) about people who are bipolar and Vyvanse improved their lives. She said she didn't think it was a good idea.

Flash forward to now, 3 months later. I want to bring it up to her again as a possibility, but I'm so nervous that she will say flat out no again. I understand there is a risk to hypomania, but I think I should be allowed to figure out if it works or not before outright denying me. Is there any advice on this topic for those of you who may have gone through something similar?";r/bipolar2;4;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o88i9q/lamotrigine_and_vyvanse/
2025-10-16 20:34:14;Is it definitely bipolar? Worth trying things?;"My (25F) ex bf (32M) and I lived together for last 3 years and we were planning to get engaged. But I recently found out he was online cheating (dating app, porn sites, etc), off and on for months. 

I broke up with him immediately and took a few months to not be in contact. Recently we got back in contact, I found out he’d been diagnosed with bipolar 1 while in his mid twenties but never told me. At the time he was working in investment banking, not sleeping more than a couple hours a night due to work, and abusing cocaine and adderall stimulants daily. He convinced himself the manic episode (which ended up w him involuntarily committed to the hospital) was entirely due to the high levels of stimulants/coke he was on and lack of sleep (he’d taken so many drug he hadn’t slept in days), so after the Dx he never took bp1 meds and he never told me about it since he was worried I’d think he was crazy.

Fast forward to our relationship - started off perfect but he got more uncompromising and intense throughout since he was taking coke/stimulants/not sleeping again. He ended up obsessively messaging a bunch of girls online during this, but never met with anyone (I looked through the messages so I’m pretty sure). 

Me leaving him was a massive wake up call and he quit the drugs cold turkey, after being on them for years, and started intensive therapy / reconnected with his psychiatrist from the past episode to get help.

Is there a possibility this was drug induced or is this 100% going to happen again even without drugs? Now when I talk to him, he’s a totally different person: calm, grounded, logical and he showed me his sleep data from his wearable and he went from sleeping 3-4 hrs nightly (every night for months) to 8. He keeps apologizing for how he treated me and is focused on fixing things. I want to maybe try reconciling with him, he’s pursuing me hard and in intensive outpatient therapy and seeing a psychiatrist etc., but this sub is really scaring me about marrying someone with bipolar.

EDIT: he also has offered I talk with his psychologist or psychiatrist if I want. He’s not in denial about the bipolar anymore but he does say he thinks the drugs induced it and he’s so calm now that he’s sober";r/BipolarSOs;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o84xm9/is_it_definitely_bipolar_worth_trying_things/
2025-10-16 19:43:30;Can’t stop ruminating over embarrassments during hypomania;"Hey, I’ve been struggling with mental health for a few years now. Diagnosis was never clear between depression, ADHD, social anxiety and lately my therapist and I realized some of my “ADHd hyperactivity” could’ve been bipolar hypomania. 

It’s always been “phases” of happiness for me which feel completely unreal once I turn into depression, and during which I almost always do some embaressing stuff that get me in trouble. 

I’ve burned so many bridges and had to move out my flat share, gotten in problems in university and even got fired from my job. Spent way too much money, etc..

I’m suffering so much of the depression right now, but every time I think of “when I was doing better” I just want the ground to open up and swallow me. 

I struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and can’t bear the thought of considering myself “crazy”. 

I’ve been to multiple psychiatrists and I’ve gotten varying opinions. My current psychoatrist thinks it’s not bipolar2 but I honestly I don’t agree with her. 

When I think of some of the stuff I did or said when I was “happy” I cringe so hard, and just cannot for the life of me believe I did these things. Like.. what the actual fuck that was not normal.

2025-10-16 15:11:33;Meds are fun.;"27F, recently diagnosed with bp1 after having a wild manic episode and almost ruining my marriage. 

So, when I had my first manic episode around a year ago, I thought I was just living the dream. Left my husband, tore my family apart, left my kids at home with family so I could go hook up with random people I had never met before. Completely and utterly reckless and not at all like myself. When I came out of it, I tried to fix everything and thankfully my husband took me back, but everything I did kind of crashed into me in my head and sent me into a downward spiral of panic attacks and anxiety. 

Long story short, prior to seeing a psych and being diagnosed, the doctor I was seeing thought it was ssri poop out and decided to switch me to Paxil, BAD IDEA. Paxil has been the absolute worst experience I've ever had with my mental health. I've felt like I've been going crazy this whole time. After diagnoses, my psych suggested tapering from Paxil and starting lamictal, this was months ago. 

I'm now on 100mg lamictal once daily, and down to 10mg Paxil once daily. I've been tapering from the Paxil at 5mg every month or so because the withdrawal symptoms are absolutely horrifying. 

Now, I need advice, or support, or suggestions, maybe even insight. Since bumping down to 10mg of the Paxil, I've been having what I assume to be mixed episodes and rapid switching. I keep going from being extremely depressed to insanely angry for no reason at the flip of a switch, sometimes both at the same time. I feel so apathetic and my swings are putting strain on my relationship. I've never experienced this before and it's making me feel insane. Should I bite the bullet and drop down another 5mg and then the rest in a week or so? The withdrawal symptoms scare me, but I think this scares me more. Should I up the lamictal from 100mg?

2025-10-16 13:49:47;Rage in Hypomania?;"I (28F) was just recently diagnosed with bipolar 2. Prior to this, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and was being treated with SSRIs with mild success for over a decade. 

Bipolar 2 is uncharted territory and there are some symptoms that really resonate with me and some not so much. 

I’ve never experienced a, for lack of a better word, “classic” manic/hypomanic episode - feeling energetic, confident, elevated mood, etc. The only symptom I experience is severe rage. This all encompassing anger that floods my mind and body. When I’m like this I feel like I can’t control myself. I throw things, break things, scream, cry - I become a person I don’t recognize.

2025-10-16 12:29:04;Very long.. I don't expect a reply. I just need to let this out;"My bf (33m, Bipolar 1) and I (26F) have been together for 7 years, so I was 19 when we first started dating.

The beginning of our relationship we fell madly in love with each other almost instantly and moved in together very quickly. Early on though, I started noticing little snippets of controlling/insecure behavior. Those little snippets turned into big situations. 

His sister lived with us for the first couple months and he accused me of being bisexual and cheating on him with her.

He tried telling me what I could and couldn't wear

He would just randomly lash out at me and call me a whore out of nowhere for really, no reason.

So things started to get worse. The emotional abuse became extremely frequent. He would call me stupid, dumb, tell me to kill myself, how he is just using me for sex and money. He'd scream at me to get out, but ""better have sex with me first"" 

I started isolating myself, not seeing my friends to try and keep him happy. I was scared of the explosive behavior, but I craved the good parts. Lost a lot of friends to this (and i get why, wish I could go back), but thankfully I still have my family who I have gotten so close to in the past several years. They really have been all I have it feels like.

I still didnt know he was bipolar. I just thought he had trauma he never dealt with and turned into a very insecure narcissist. I still had hope, somehow, I dont even know.

Then there was the first time he hit me. I remember it clear as day. He had some friends over. I came home after work, went and put on leggings to get comfortable at home, came out in the living room and he pulled me aside and asked if I wanted him to break up with me. I walked away into the bedroom, embaressed. I knew he'd been drinking, too. He followed me, slapped me in the face so hard that my ear popped and I couldn't hear out of it. He started ripping my leggings apart and tried to push me in the hallway where his friends could see and said ""if you wanna act like a whore, you can look like one too"". From that time there was lots of other physical abuse, but mostly extreme verbal abuse. He has choked me, hit me, kicked me, etc. 

My mom and dad found out. They saw bruises on my arms and I tried to hide it, cried my eyes out and confessed, but not all these details. My dad being the amazing person he is, mustered up the courage to have a conversation with him. My dads words were ""because I know you're not going to leave him"". Pathetic of me, I know. 

He has never physically hurt me again.

Somehow, I always chose forgiveness. Maybe it was my need and want to be loved and accepted. Maybe it was because I thought I could fix him. I dont know. My counselor explains it as the same person who breaks you, is naturally the same person you want to fix it. Up to this point, I had always felt like I handled things okay. My reactive behavior was to just cry my eyes out and diffuse the situation and try to rationalize with him instead of matching his terribly mean attitude.

After all this, there was a pretty good 2 years we had with minimal issues. At least extreme issues like it had always been. He started to get very close to my family, even my dad. 

But fast forward, these past 2 years (his dad passed away 2 yrs ago as well) everything has changed. It became way more clear to me this isnt just a traumatized person turned narcissist. There is something really going on mentally. He had 2 manic episodes these past 2 summers, lasting 4 months long each, the 2nd summer it turned into psychosis, after many months long episodes of extreme depression, suicidal thoughts.

During this time, he quit his job, wasnt sleeping, wasnt eating, calling 50 people a day, going into businesses trying to redo their repair needs like flooring etc (something he has no business in), he was drinking non stop, smoking, told everyone he makes 6 figures (with no job) he was talking about cheating on me and how he met someone who is better than me, he would leave for weeks at a time, come home and bring random piles of things home from yard sales in pure amazement, tried moving up north on a piece of property and tried to take our cat, every time he'd come back home from wherever he was he'd basically destroy our house, yell at me again and leave, tried bossing me around saying I'm the house maid, he bought a Harley motorcycle, 2 new cars, a property, was spending 500 plus dollars everywhere he went and opened 5 different credit cards. He went from having 100k in savings (from his dads trust) to being 60k in debt within 4 months in one summer. He was completely out of control and irrational. Very hyper. 

During the psychosis he was screaming and crying to me at 5 a.m saying people were going to come in and shoot us, would cry for 30 seconds then get all hyper 20 seconds later, started screaming into his laptop saying the government is listening, he accused me of having a knife behind my back trying to kill him, he threatened to kill me, thought his friend was spying on him and that the military was coming for him, and then he stole my car, went to a friend's house. They got him hospitalized. When I went to visit him at the hospital, he was telling everyone he is a doctor, lawyer, and I'm his nurse there to release him. He told me the patients keep talking about how I slept with them. He said he keeps seeing my family at the hospital, that they are spies. Said Sandra Bullock owns the hospital. Thought signing the hospital papers was selling his soul. 

They originally diagnosed him schizophrenic, but changed to bipolar 1 after getting more info. 

Currently, he is fully medicated and just started therapy. He is a general manager at a store now. He's sold a lot of his things and working on getting out of debt. He's accepted his diagnosis. He feels sorry for ever putting me through all of this.

But I feel empty this time. I feel like my body is in stress all of the time, I feel like I have nothing left to pour. Im 26, no degree, no friends anymore, I gained all my weight back, poured everything I had into a relationship that destroyed me mentally and physically. 7 years I can never take back. I'm just miserable and so so mad at myself. Why did I do this to myself? Why did I allow this? During his manic/depression periods I gave him my absolute best. I feel like I thought his problems were so much more significant than mine, that I put myself on the side. I didnt care that he was destroying me. I just wanted him to get better. Because I really believed there is such a good hearted person underneath it all. I kept telling myself I cant leave him like this. Thats not the type of person I am. I know hes unwell, and I wouldn't be being true to myself if I left him in that state.

I also am always on the fence now. I notice every little behavior now. Like this summer, when he starts getting more active, started vaping again, drinking caffeine again, drank alcohol for a couple weeks. Starts hanging out with a bunch of people again, Gets irritable with me, my mind instantly goes to he's on the verge of another episode. I am so paranoid. Its hard too because when I point out certain things his response is ""do you just want me to sit in the house and get depressed again?"" 

Idk I feel like I'm quite literally traumatized and I have no one who understands except my therapist. I feel like the weight of the awful times these past 7 years, hit me like a ton of bricks. I dont feel stable. I've felt unsafe in a life of chaos for so long 

But now hes getting help. All I ever wanted for him, for us.. I feel so stuck. So so so stuck.  I dont view him romantically anymore and I'm almost grieving the love I had for him. He's upset that I cant move on and dont want to be intimate or even cuddle anymore, but there's a part of me that still wishes I did and can keep things going. Maybe im afraid it feels this has all been for nothing. I dont know. I'm kinda just numb.

I want marriage, and I want to be a mother so badly. I want someone to build a stable life with, a best friend and partner in life. 

I'm forced to face the fact that I am no longer that full of life 19 year old girl wanting to tackle the world, I'm now a 26 year old woman who just feels broken and watching all my old friends married, happy with their careers and having their first child. I want it so bad, but I am so far from it. I wish I could go back and hug myself and tell myself I deserved more, for ME.

2025-10-16 10:09:01;He forgot he hurt his feet (during mixed episode);"I know I posted yesterday, but I still have so many questions. 

Does your BPSO ever get so deep into a mixed episode that they forget things... even physical aches and pains? I **think** mine does. 

During the first week of July, he hurt the bottoms of his feet while walking (further than he normally would have). There were blisters on them. He went to the ER at least four times during the month of July and at least once during Auguust with vatious complaints. If and when he mentioned his feet to the medical staff, he usually mentioned them last... after all the other things that were bothering him. Additionally, he went to at least two different Urgemt Care facilities during July and at least once to his PCP. I know his PCP and at least one of the ERs looked at and tended to his blisters. However, one of the sores apparently never healed properly. 

Fast forward to now (mid-Octobet) and he intermittently complains of a sharp corn-like pain in/on the bottom of his foot. He has asked me if I would shave or cut off part of it. I look at it, take pics of it to show him, and do not see what I could do that would remedy the pain. I tell him that I think it needs to be cut deeper than I would feel comfortable doing.

Obviously, he needs a doctor to look at it. However, he talks about calling one to make an appointment. Then, when he actually tries to call one, he doesn't seem to have the attention span or patience to schedule it. (He thinks he needs a different PCP (than the one he has had for three years) to *operate* on it.) Oh, and he has been intermittently complaining (to me) about the various ERs NOT looking at his feet. 

So again, I ask... does this sound familiar?

2025-10-16 06:37:58;How did you realize?;"When did you realize you might have bipolar disorder? What was the point where you took action? 

Please hear me out, it’s a long and complex story but I would love to hear your thoughts. 

I’ve had the sneaking suspicion for a long time that my emotions don’t feel normal, and there’s a running line of mental illness in my dads family. My uncle would have delusions of grandiosity, hear voices, and have agressive outbursts. They were from a strict religious family, so he never got help. He died in a truck accident, after he had not slept after being on the road for two days straight. My dad hears “the voice of god”, but he only falls into this grandiose feeling of religion after major stressors, like after divorce, losing his job, his dad. He tends to do impulsive things, like marry a random asian woman, spending lots of money, not sleep at all, fast for days, and he can just get very agressive or weary of people. My brother has diagnosed borderline disorder, but he also gets into these very hyper moods, where he learns a new skill within like two months, spends a ton of money on these hobbies, talks about it every day, and then just stops. He’s been very depressed before, with suicidal attempts. He can be incoherent and actually scarily delusional, one time to a point where he stalked his ex-girlfriend until police got involved. 

Because I’ve spend so much time around this, I really don’t know what is “normal”. I’ve always kind of “understood” my dad and brother, but my swings feel “dampened” compared to theirs. I rarely feel depressed, but sometimes i wonder if i get hypomanic. I feel like I got out of a hypomanic episode that has lasted this entire year. I was just só fired up: I had barely recovered from a major health issue and fell in love, found myself having my schedule packed with friends, appointments, uni, and projects. I took on so many things. Often times I would just feel high. I would talk for minutes on end and my sleep and appetite has been disturbed for months. It would especially get really bad during my ovulation. I would want to see all my friends, feel flirty with anyone and just have an embarrassingly high sex drive. I’d sleep 4 hours and feel fine. I couldn’t sit still. 

This lead to me just going on and on, while I felt my body getting very weak due to me not resting enough after my health issues. I remember there was one night where I had to make a very long bike ride with some friends, and I was severely anemic at this point. All my bones were hurting and we were biking across this bridge. I was noticing I was tired, like severely, scarily tired, and I just suddenly felt very ‘scared’ and of the big structures of the bridge? I don’t know if it makes sense, but i truly felt like something was not right! 

Anyway, i got treatment for the anemia, but then i just got worse! I feel like my anemia tiredness softened my hyperness, but after it got fixed i remember i once biked for hours because my energy felt endless. I was flying around! I also have severe hip dysplasia, so one week I just walked too much, but I was barely feeling pain, and i luxated my hip. It can only be fixed with a hip replacement surgery, so now my mobility is bad until i get the surgery. I kept walking on it for the last few months and in the moment I do so I feel invincible, don’t feel pain, until the pain actually gets so bad it makes me crash (but then i recover in like a day and keep going, despite the pain). 

A month ago my relationship ended, and after that i had my last “energy spurt”. I took on three freelance jobs, kept walking on my horrible leg, and saw all kinds of friends. Convincing everyone I wasn’t sad at all about the breakup (and I am still more angry and sad, but that’s not important). I mostly mean: from the outside people seem to think I’m doing really well, “despite” everything that has come for me this year, but I’m wondering now: is that normal in my circumstances?

I feel like the past week, I just snapped out of something unexplainable. I feel drained. I can’t get myself to do anything that takes a bit of mental energy. I’m suddenly behind on uniwork and my freelance projects. I don’t feel like socializing. My head feels foggy and strange. I don’t feel like “myself” and I’m asking myself where my drive is?

But I’m wondering if I might have the same issues as my family members, which are just not as noticeable because of my health issues? I don’t become very impulse (with money and risk-taking, at least), but I do become restless and over-extend myself majorly, which people around me have just accepted as part of myself and my disability. If someone “normal” walked until their hip gave out, it would be a red flag, right? ";r/bipolar2;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o7pgww/how_did_you_realize/
2025-10-16 04:53:45;Starting Vraylar?;"So I received an official diagnosis of bipolar 2 in 2021 after i worked 6 12 hr night shifts in a row with little sleep and a great mood. I have always struggled with irritability and periods of severe depression. For the last several years, my meds have not changed:

60mg Cymbalta daily

200mg lamictal daily

2 mg valium twice a day

50-100mg seroquel as needed for sleep.

Lately, I feel like I have had more severe lows. Tried abilify as an adjunct, felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. Tried liothyronine, didn't do anything and was pricy with insurance.

So I switched psychiatrists to one in-network (I was self paying) to see about ketamine therapy or TMS. Ended up with instructions to taper off my Cymbalta over the next week and start taking 1.5mg Vraylar daily, so now my med list will look like this:

200mg lamictal daily

1.5mg Vraylar daily

2mg valium twice a day

50-100mg seroquel as needed for sleep.

What has been everyone's experience with vraylar? My biggest concern right now is potentially going through cymbalta withdrawals and weight gain.";r/BipolarReddit;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o7mw98/starting_vraylar/

I do get severe anxiety when im in my depressive state but it will occasionally show in my hypomania episodes too? Which confuses me because my psychiatrist did tell me that depression and anxiety go hand in hand. I have anti depressants for that but it seems like when i get anxious when im hypomanic, its not as bad as my depressive state, still i get so anxious sometimes the thinking is too much and the mood stabilizer isn’t really helping much with it.

2025-10-16 02:08:47;Infidelity during a manic episode.. we’re in therapy and trying to rebuild. Has anyone made it through this?”;"My partner and I have been together almost 10 years. About two years ago, he went through what we now know was a manic episode (he wasn't diagnosed then). He also relapsed after years of full sobriety during this, everything was a chaotic mess.

Since then.. he’s been diagnosed with bipolar, is on medication, sees a psychiatrist and therapist regularly, is active in his faith, and has been fully sober again for several months.

Recently.. he confessed that during that period, he cheated.. emotionally and physically four times with a coworker and a brief emotional with a different coworker, in same time frame. At the time.. he was barely sleeping or eating, spending recklessly, and we were constantly fighting and distant, sleeping in opposite rooms a lot of the time, he was racking up thousands of debt, he had a high sex drive then and we weren't really intimate much. None of that excuses it... but it gives some context.

Now.. he’s stable, remorseful, and says he’s fully committed to rebuilding. We’ve started couples therapy, both do individual therapy, he changed his number, we share locations, and he’s agreed to switch shifts or jobs so he’s no longer around her (we’re waiting on an opening for that to go through though).

He’s admitted that during that time he felt “checked out” and less connected, that he also ""felt invincible"", he says he wasn't in his right state of mind (not excusing it but he def wasn't acting like himself) says he is in love with me and wants to rebuild something stronger and healthier, been a month since he told me. I’m still heartbroken, scared, and struggling with how to trust again. My biggest fear is it happening again. He insists that because of his faith, guilt/shame, and love for me, he never would do it again.. but of course, the fear is still there.

We were actually planning our wedding and talking about trying for kids before all this came out, so I’m still processing a lot. However.... we also just found out I am currently pregnant, which makes everything feel even heavier.

For those who’ve been here and made it through infidelity... how did you rebuild? What helped you heal and learn to trust again?

Based on what everyone says on this sub and others, it seems best to be careful about when to disclose my diagnosis. The kicker here is that, when I end up hypomanic, my sexuality changes drastically. Ordinarily, I identify as aroace. When hypomanic, I could literally be anything depending on the day.

That leads me to hopping onto dating apps and, unfortunately, being spotted by folks I know irl who know how I usually identify. I'm only ever on the apps (and questioning my sexuality) as long as an episode lasts, but I have no idea how to explain this sudden shift in sexuality without saying I'm bipolar 2.

2025-10-15 22:13:34;dealing with mixed episode tips?;"hello everyone, i’m seeking advice on how to navigate a mixed episode with bipolar 2. here is some background information for context: 

• currently taking 20mg of lexapro and 20mg of latuda 
• have been displaying symptoms since 18
• got diagnosed at 20yo (2 years ago), was put on abilify at first. adjusting was very difficult, i had gnarly side effects, but overall, it stabilized me a ton. however, since i wasn’t a fan of the side effects, i recently switched to latuda in april. it was mainly for my sleep problems.
• been going through major stressors in life recently (breakup, lost a lot of friends, transferred to a new college, moved back in with parents)

i have been monitoring my symptoms for a week now, and i have been oscillating between an elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, accomplishing everything on my to-do list to skipping all of my classes, not eating, and staying in bed all day. obviously, this has been extremely uncomfortable to go through, as my mood will swing every day or even within a few hours. i have been taking my medication everyday and i am currently in therapy, but as someone with overbearing parents who don’t really “believe” in my bipolar and who has tons of responsibilities, it’s really hard when i see and feel my disorder affect my day-to-day functioning. no mom, i don’t think it’s normal that i skipped all my classes and have stayed in bed all day and have only gotten up to use the restroom on a wednesday. no professor, i don’t think it’s appropriate of me to skip your class every other day (even though i think the material is boring as fuck). 

i’ve tried researching some articles online about what to do, but i thought asking here would help more. unfortunately, i either haven’t had a mixed episode ever or haven’t had one in years before i was formally diagnosed, so i don’t really know what to do other than “ride it out”. i’m not afraid - just concerned, frustrated, and sad. i also know i’m very young and have JUST started to deal with this, so any long-term advice would also help a lot. <3

2025-10-15 21:47:12;Possible misdiagnosis;Hello. Firstly, I am going to speak to my psychiatrist regarding this, but I wanted to see if anyone had any information/feedback. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost 10 years ago and ADHD prior to that. Stimulant medication made me sleepy (at the time I was on a “non therapeutic dose” of an atypical antipsychotic) so I stopped. I was eventually put on several medications for bipolar and I noticed a flat affect but my “mood” had stabilized, to an extent. I currently have brain fog, issues with tiredness, hyper-focus, no focus, irritability, periods of “joy”, but I feel like they are based on external factors. I can’t remember if that was the case 10 years ago. I know I have always had ADHD but I feel like some of my symptoms are because of the medication. My biggest fear is coming off the medication and being a complete mess. Has anyone felt misdiagnosed or wrongly medicated? Have you come off bipolar medication and maybe prescribed something different and felt better/worse? I don’t want my fear to effect something in my life this big and was just looking for some feedback. I have an appointment at the end of the month so I will speak to them about it at that time.

I changed 3 psychiatrists: 1st one told me I'm bipolar and maybe borderline but we don't really care about borderline because it's untreatable (red flag 1), 2nd one told me i'm borderline and when i asked him ""why not bipolar in your opinion?"", he said that I wouldn't be able to finish high school, let alone have two master degrees (red flag 2). I was prescribed *olanzapine*, *cariprazine* and *efexor*, didn't take any of those because i didn't trust him. 3rd one is my current psychiatrist who i feel i trust, his diagnosis was bipolar 2 and borderline. I am on *abilify* (3mg) atm, feel more stable in general but the existential dread is still present. I haven't really had a full blown mixed episode (if that's what this is) since I started meds, but i still feel it's constantly there somehow. I have to say that on top of everything my life is super stressful rn, so that doesn't help at all. I was also prescribed *lorazepam* and *mirtazapine*, only for emergencies, when i really have to sleep.   
Tbh, I see myself as the abomination of bipolar, have extreme imposter syndrom and doubt this diagnosis mainly because I thought hypomania is something really nice and euphoric. But for me it's *rage, delusions, self loathing, crawling out of my skin feeling, dissociation*. The closest to euphoric i've ever felt was just working in my studio without sleeping or eating, talking more etc. I am only really euphoric for very short periods or when high and my mood swings are literally sprinting. I don't know if this has to do with the comorbidity with bpd or it's what a mixed state really looks like.   
I want to reach out to people, borderpolar or not, experiencing mixed episodes. I want to understand the life span of this hellhole. Does this ever go away?

I started looking into bipolar a few months ago after several people pointed out to me that my symptoms fit, including my therapist.

In true autistic fashion I read some books and research, and wrote an essay to my psych on why I think I might have bipolar. I went to see my psych this week and she basically said yes, it all seems to fit with bipolar, offered me the ""gold standard"" medication after a pretty thorough chat about treatments and sent me on my way with some leaflets.

And I'm left thinking, is that it? Am I diagnosed? Have I really spent 20 years in and out of mental health services with nobody seemingly able to tell me what's wrong with me, only to have to eventually diagnose myself? And it's just accepted, just like that? I'm so confused. Is this how it usually works?

2025-10-15 16:58:17;Didn’t think things got better, but a new medication seems to be helping;"Just wanted to share some tentative good news. For several years since diagnosis I’ve been on lamotrigine by itself and felt “stable” at a level I would describe as “manageably shit”. Not suicidally depressed but generally unhappy with constant bubbling intrusive negative thoughts I thought I would just have to live with.

After reading lots of people on here having success with a mix of lamotrigine plus an antidepressant (and sometimes antipsychotic as well) I thought I’d ask to try adding one just to see. The first time I asked my GP they referred me to mental health services but I never heard back. The second time I asked I happened to get a different GP who referred me again but was happy to try prescribing herself, so I’ve been taking sertraline for about three weeks now.

The results so far have been more positive than I could ever have hoped. I had a few days struggling to get to sleep which made me worried it was going to trigger hypomania but that cleared up v quickly. Intrusive thoughts have almost entirely gone away and my mind is more at ease than I remember it being for a long time. I still spend all my free time doomscrolling so still a long way to go to be “healthy” but it feels like a significant step forward.

2025-10-15 06:20:43;i think i went hypomanic and it kinda scares me;"
I feel quite stupid doing this but it’s been weighing my mind since then. If any person who has dealt with something similar or is diagnosed with bipolar could share their insight i would be very thankful. I don’t really think im bipolar myself but it came up a lot when i was sniffing around what could it be if anything.
Looking back on it now it maybe wasn’t the first time but it was never prominent enough for me to think of it as something bigger. So to describe what happened two weeks: 

- In entirety it lasted 5/4 days 
- highly increased energy 
- racing thoughts(speech problem, hard time remembering) 
- creativity (started multiple projects, decided i magically knew how to professionally edit and produce music) 
- decreased need for sleep (had to force myself to push 3 hours on the worst day and was still absolutely bottled with energy the whole next day)
- impulsive 
- looking back i don’t really recognize myself 
- in that state i believed i was never depressed and wasn’t able to imagine myself as i usual am
- very different thought process, seeing things in different ways than normally 

That’s what i can say from top of my mind. After the 4/5 days there was a rapid decline. I felt completely numb and just what i was familiar with for years (dealing with depression for some time - declined medication in the past because of my parents as i was underage at the time). 
And that’s how i know myself most of my life, that i can remember. Hard to hold onto any passion. I can force myself enough to function but it’s extremely tiring. 
All this just messed my feelings of self even more since it kinda was never even there to begin with. I think that’s why i ended up here to see if maybe someone is or has experienced something similar.

2025-10-15 06:13:21;How did you feel when diagnosed?;"Hello! I just got diagnosed well… today! And I uh. Am not sure how to feel about it? I went to the psychologist to get assessed for ADHD, which I knew I already had because it’s something that my entire family and every teacher I’ve had agrees on. But as I was describing what I thought was just emotional irregularities because of ADHD, my psychologist just sent me a quick test over bipolar 2 and boom! Guess I have it! But I just. Idk I feel very… empty? Like I feel like there should be fanfare, something more, a sudden realization of “THATS why I’m like this!” But I just feel. Confused? Distrustful? I’m not sure. Maybe it’s because I have more important things to focus on (exam tomorrow) and maybe I just need some time to process what this means for me. 

How did y’all feel when you were diagnosed? Any simulator stories?? ";r/bipolar2;18;24;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o6tifg/how_did_you_feel_when_diagnosed/
2025-10-15 05:54:11;Need motivation;"Hello everyone.

This is my first ever time using reddit, so I’m a bit anxious but I’ve literally reached my breaking point. I need some help with people who have been living with this disorder for a while and have experience with managing it. 

I got diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and PTSD in 2022 but was never told about my diagnoses. I assumed I had depression and PTSD but never would’ve thought Bipolar. Anyways, in 2022 I reached a really bad low and was forced to see a psychiatrist. The whole year was a lot of trial and error with meds. At the end of 2022 I was on Lamotrigine and Vraylar. I cold turkey quit taking my meds and ghosted my psychiatrist (for reasons I don’t remember) and have just been getting past constant struggles since then. Almost the entire year of 2022 is a blip in my memory, including my high school graduation which is so depressing to think about. 

Anyways, I’ve been having a really hard time basically for the past 10 years just struggling with my brain. I cannot hold down a job for more than 6 months, sometimes I will quit the same week that i’m hired. It’s really bad. Right now I’ve been at my current job for 7 months and have been mentally fighting with myself to not quit, but calling out is getting harder and harder to not do every week. 

Some stuff happened in the past 3 months that has opened up a lot of old trauma and it’s REALLY set me back mentally. Thing is, i’m not 16-18 anymore. I’m a full grown adult with bills and responsibilities. I physically cannot stop working or I will not be able to afford to live.

Here comes my biggest issue. Getting treatment for Bipolar is extremely expensive. I was manic last week and almost quit working, drove an hour out of town with little to no sleep for over 2 days. I called out 2 hours before I was scheduled to open on a VERY busy meeting day. I was a wreck. Somehow I wasn’t fired over it and my manager gave me a leave of absence for 5 days. I went ahead and scheduled a Therapy appointment and that’s where he told me that I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and PTSD in 2022. I started mentally freaking out because I had no idea what Bipolar disorder was actually like, I just thought I was more depressed than the average person. This caused me to go down an even bigger spiral, feeling like life is pointless and I should just give up. I have people depending on me financially so I can’t necessarily give up, but I can’t afford treatment. I’m already living paycheck to paycheck.

I tried to file for disability and was told my best bet was to contact a lawyer to hire, so I did. They immediately shut me down and said I can’t file because i’m currently working full time. So, I have to quit working to have even a slight chance of being able to file for disability??? I literally can’t afford treatment on my own and don’t know what to do.

I feel like i’m being pushed past my breaking point. I’m going to continue working until I eventually break and give up. Then what? I become homeless and lose everything? I’m just so lost right now and need help. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. Any advice would be so appreciated right now, please and thank you ";r/BipolarReddit;4;57;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o6t1cy/need_motivation/
2025-10-15 03:44:23;Need advice on how to talk to SO about their times they don't remember.;"Hey everyone. My ex is diagnosed BP2, has been medicated with only sertraline for a year now straight. 


We are trying to CO parent our child, who is special needs and nonverbal. 


I'm trying to talk to them about their treatment, because they are clearly still struggling ( on edge all the time, sleeping 16 hours a day, hypersexual ). 
I feel like they need to be on a mood stabilizer, and they disagreed for a long time, then last appointment he mentioned it to his med management and they decided to up the sertraline for a month and see if that helps. 


But the real question here is, how do you handle talking to them or interacting with them when they deny things that you remember them doing or saying while manic or hypomanic? My therapist tells me that I should be firm and put my foot down on trying to help them until they accept that they have to deal with having points they don't remember but still have to answer to. 



I'm exhausted. I'm at a point where I'm so tired with it I feel like giving up on the strength I have keeping me together.

2025-10-15 03:31:06;practices that build more self-acceptance and self-love?;"I've been diagnosed bipolar 1 since 2012. I'm now turning 40 soon, and wondering how to better support and love myself, especially during the low depressive moments of the illness. What practices do you all do that build more self-acceptance? Like accepting all of yourself including the illness, and loving yourself regardless. I find bipolar can give me a lot of shame sometimes, especially when I'm not super balanced. Like if I say or do things I later regret. 

Anyway, so far I've tried a morning meditation each morning called ""Loving Kindness for Ourselves"" by Chris Germer. It teaches me to give myself what I need with kindness and love. Like if I need warmth and care, to give it to myself, rather than wait for someone else to give it to me. I've also been doing affirmations for the past few weeks, to build more self-validation and self-acceptance. 

But I'm still finding it's hard for me to truly feel comfortable with who I am at times, especially knowing I have the bipolar illness. What other practices do you all do to increase self-acceptance and self-love? 

I do seek regular therapy, but just wanted to hear from you all too. ";r/BipolarReddit;4;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o6p8fh/practices_that_build_more_selfacceptance_and/

2025-10-15 00:32:13;My experience with bipolar;"Everything started back in 2018. I was studying Computer Engineering and was in my second year of university. I had just come out of a three-year relationship and I was at a really low point. A bit later I met a girl from my class. We connected, I fell for her and soon we were together. It was one of the most intense relationships I have ever had, but also one of the most toxic. The signs were there, I just couldn’t see them back then.



About six months later I had my first manic episode with psychosis during the summer of 2018. I was 20 years old at the time. Now I am 27 and seven years have passed. I was hospitalized in a university clinic where I was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder.



I remember very clearly how it all started. At first, you do not need sleep. You feel rested even without closing your eyes. You have energy, ideas and confidence. You become more aggressive, more protective of your space and you feel like you can do anything. It is like a wave of euphoria takes over you and makes you feel unstoppable. At first it feels amazing. But later, when your batteries run out and your brain stops producing dopamine and serotonin at those levels, you crash. You are left with almost nothing. It is like a very strong coffee. It lifts you up at first, but later you pay for it twice as hard.



I started medication back then, Tavor and Zylanza (a cheaper alternative to Zyprexa). Since then I have seen seven psychiatrists and tried almost every treatment available for bipolar disorder. None of them really worked for me because of the side effects, so I stopped everything.



Now I do not take any medication and I try to manage it on my own. It is not easy at all. It is a battle every day, but I try to keep my balance and notice when my mood starts to shift before it goes too far.

2025-10-15 00:00:22;Husband prefers mania;Married 20 years. Husband is diagnosed bipolar. He has had two previous psychotic episodes, causing us to have to relocate, start over with new jobs. He actually gets paid well and has a high performing job….because he is able to outwork peers, due to mania. Although I fear his mental illness may be catching up with him, in that his reputation may be tarnished from repeated psychotic episodes. He recently had a psychotic episode where he was highly agitated, angry with explosive temper and rage, directed at me and the kids. Throwing things off walls, stalking me and the kids when we asked for space. He has delusions that I am out to get him, told me I am trying to kill him and take his kids away. I am trying to help him while protecting the kids from experiencing his abuse. We become isolated when people realize he is crazy and then me and kids have no friends or support. i had to go to his psychiatrist without him (he refused to go) and get his Ambilify increased, which seems to have helped with the agitation, but the paranoia is still there. He seems to not have insight into his own behavior and said he feels fine now. Not realizing the damage he has done while psychotic. He was displaced from his job as an executive and told they will find him another job internally by end of year once the acquisition closes. I am worried that they realize he has mental health issues and may just let him go. He is not concerned. He told me that he doesn’t like to be medicated because it destroys his creativity and makes him sleepy. He sees me as a problem because I am in the way of his mania. I am seriously considering returning back to my home town without him where me and kids have support. My oldest daughter has begged me to divorce him. he doesn’t seem to be cooperative and I don’t think it’s wise to relocate with him again for the next job, who knows where. looking for advice for spouses dealing with similar situation, where BPSO lacks insight into their destructive behavior, enjoys the mania and sees the spouse as the problem….not the illness. I feel like I know my answer, but curious how much they resist and make it difficult to divorce/leave.;r/BipolarSOs;15;17;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o6jht8/husband_prefers_mania/

My therapist suggested talking to my friends about these feelings and explaining my diagnosis to them, but the idea of doing that makes me feel sick too bc I’m scared to even reach out to them anymore. I stopped talking to them and I deleted all social media so I don’t accidentally see them bc even seeing a picture of them makes me start spiraling.

2025-10-14 19:55:27;What is going on?;"My husband's is diagnosed bp2, went through a terrible 3 month depression earlier this year, meds were changed from sodium valporate to lithium in this episode and he came out of the depression. A few months later he's started having manic symptoms (nothing life altering but I've been on edge for over a month now) the last 2 weeks he's been so irritable and overwhelmed easily, Monday night he didn't sleep at all, (was awake 36hrs straight and not tired) the day after this and currently he's been flat as, sooky, tired, lazy it's like he's gone into mild depression right after being manic?

Does someone understand what is happening here?
Psychiatrist appt next week, but I'm not sure whether to ask to up meds or add on?

2025-10-14 13:44:40;Has anyone smoked weed on caplyta;"I recently got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I still doubt the diagnosis, but I guess that’s a normal thing. I don’t know — I’m still scared about the fact that I’m taking an antipsychotic, because, well, I’m not psychotic and never have been. I know antipsychotics aren’t just for people who are psychotic, but maybe it’s just the label that scares me.

Anyway, I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar depression. I used to be a smoker and never really had any issues with it. I don’t overindulge, but I do enjoy smoking and playing guitar sometimes — maybe three times a month.

I’ve been clean from weed for about three months now and recently started taking Caplyta. I was wondering if it’s okay to smoke again. My biggest fear is that I’ll go manic or something. I’ve never really been manic — I’m mostly just depressed or low on motivation.

I want to be able to take my meds but still enjoy my other hobbies, like smoking occasionally or having a light drink with friends in my band. I’m just scared of the risks. I thought maybe I’d be fine since I’ve never had a big issue with weed in the past, and I’ve never gone manic or become psychotic because of it.

Sorry — this turned into a huge rant, but yeah.

2025-10-14 09:14:06;Those that are the bipolar partner, what did you need and want most from your partners during your episode?;"My partner (23M) and I (25F) have been together for 6 years. For 5 years, we had the perfect relationship. Ultimate trust, ultimate happiness, ultimate peace. He is the love of my life, and the mellow, introverted yin to my loud, extroverted yang. 2 years ago, he had his first manic episode after starting a new job. I was discarded, he spent thousands of dollars, was paranoid, and became verbally abusive. A trip to the ER lead to an outpatient program that lead to an official diagnosis of bipolar I. This episode lasted about a month and a half followed by a few months of depression. He stopped seeing his friends, he stopped playing video games, he wanted to quit his job that he worked so hard for. He is on 2g of Abilify and did therapy until his social anxiety and introvertedness took over and he decided to quit therapy but he still continued with the medication. For almost 2 years, our relationship struggled with the trauma, the mistrust, and my anxiety of it possibly happening again. We got engaged 4 months ago. I am so confident that, even though it’s hard, the life with him is the life I want. A month ago today he stopped sleeping, and I caught him applying to out-of-state jobs, applying for a business license, and applying for doctorates programs. He became paranoid again and we found ourselves in the ER again, where he punched some holes in the wall. He discarded me again, moved out, bought a 77k car, and is now staying at his mother’s. It’s been a month. I know it takes time. We went from spending every second of everyday together to him not even yearning to see me. He tells me he loves me and that he wants to make this work. I know his emotions aren’t stable right now so i cant expect him to be as affectionate as he used to. I don’t want to give up on him so please don’t tell me to. I just want to understand what is going on in his mind. To BipolarSO’s, what have you done to support your partner during an episode? And to those that have bipolar, what did you need and want most from your partners during your episode?

Edit: he is still medicated. His mother and I are in contact everyday and she makes sure to watch him take his medication every single day. He has reached out to the outpatient program that diagnosed him and is restarting. ";r/BipolarSOs;7;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o621vi/those_that_are_the_bipolar_partner_what_did_you/
2025-10-14 08:41:27;Medication advice;"I have bipolar 1, along with BPD, OCD, and ADHD. I honestly think I’m autistic based on my behaviors etc and some of the scores on my psych eval but have not an evaluation solely for autism. 
I currently take lithium, Fluvoxomine, prazosin, and trazadone. I just stopped taking seroquel. 

My husband left me in March due to the severity of my Bipolar (and other dx), this led to me becoming manic and fucking up everything I could lmao followed by a long depression. 

July was when I finally was diagnosed with ADHD after knowing or assuming anyway that I’d always had it.  I tried strattera and it made hypomanic and I quit my job after 2 weeks lol.  Psychiatrist said I need to be more stable before attempting an adhd med. 

In July I was inpatient and was prescribed Latuda. Even a small dose caused hypomania for me. I then tried seroquel for 2 months, I was struggling very badly with hypomania while on seroquel so decided to come off of it with approval from my psychiatrist. 

I just feel like I cannot get anything right at this point.  I can’t survive like this. It’s always one extreme or the other and between medication and therapy I still can’t find a happy medium. I desperately want to be treated for adhd because I am struggling very badly at work. I want to be treated for bipolar depression because I’m fucking up at life.  My lithium is at a low dose right now but at this point I’m so tired of trying new doses and new medicines. 

I guess what I’m asking, is what else should I try? My psychiatrist is nice enough but she doesn’t try very hard to get to the root of the issue. The state I live in doesn’t have the best mental health resources. Should I try a new psych? Stick with this one and insist she listen to what’s going on not just hoping for the best with whatever medicine she thinks of?

I didn’t work for almost an entire year and then my husband left so I had to get a job again and I’m just so overwhelmed and feel like I’m drowning constantly. Even not working I wasn’t doing well at all but god now it’s so much. I read into every single thing my coworkers say/do. I constantly think I’m in trouble or not doing something correctly. Trying to mask at work and seem like I’m enjoying being there or even like a person is so hard.

I know Wellbutrin works well for  withdrawals.  Do yall think they will take away my Wellbutrin if I admit? Should I just leave it at mdd? I’m suprised they have not looked up my Medical records.

2025-10-14 05:06:01;Ex with bipolar wants to see me again;"I have no one in my personal life to talk to about this so I guess I’m turning to Reddit for advice. 

I was with my ex bf for 12 years and we broke up about 10 years ago. Mostly just because I wanted to move on in life to a more adult lifestyle where he was happy with job hopping and living at home. We kept in contact throughout the years and I felt like we stayed friends for the most part. He would confide in me with things and he eventually told me he was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago. Looking back on our relationship, a lot of things made more sense. 

Recently he has been texting me more just about life in general. He has a good job that he excels in, his own place with a cat and he has lost weight and keeps up with the gym. I was happy to hear things were going well for him. 

A band we both are fans of came to town and we both had tickets. He asked if I wanted to meet up afterwards just to say hi. We ended up seeing each other after the show and he asked if I was interested in meeting up soon for dinner and I said yes of course. Seeing him after so long was nice and it felt like we hadn’t been apart for 10 years. He just comes naturally to me like no one ever has since. 

Well a few days after that concert, he texted me saying he was in the hospital because he tried to commit suicide and he would be transferred to inpatient psych the next day. I was shocked to say the least. Never in my life did I I expect him to do that. We had just been texting that night and he was showing me his cat. 

Now he is calling me from the facility, saying he loves me and can’t wait to see me and how much he’s missed us. I gently told him that he needs to focus on himself right now by getting his medication adjusted and talking to his therapist about everything. 

He told me he feels better and he knows what triggered him. He is in legal trouble and has a ton of guilt and shame about it. 

I’m the type of person that wants to fix people and make things better but the older I get the more I realize that I cannot do that. It kills me to not give him a chance but at the same time, I feel like the last thing he needs is to get together with his ex girlfriend no matter how much he thinks he loves me. 

I just need advice. Is this relationship ever going to work after some time has passed and he has his meds and therapy working? Or am I just going to get myself into something I may end up regretting in the long run? I’m already panicking about another suicide attempt. I haven’t been sleeping well since this all happened.

I just feel guilty/shameful for even thinking about stopping my meds (fear of people thinking i’m manic), but I truly just feel better right now.

I’m not dismissing my diagnosis, but i’m on other meds that are incredibly helpful and have been trying to make more behavioral changes (eating well, not engaging in ED behaviors, exercising more…) and seeing if that will help with my mood. Has anyone else ever gone through this or struggled with side effects of unbearable fatigue? Or have you ever gone off your meds while stable/NOT manic?

2025-10-14 00:11:42;Feeling like used and abused;"Hi everyone,

I was in a relationship for over a year with a man who has bipolar disorder type II. I knew about his diagnosis and some of his other issues, but I didn’t truly understand what the illness looks like in real life.

In August, he had an episode where he yelled at me and said awful things. I packed my things and left immediately. He was later hospitalized. Later he even admitted that he had taken me for granted but he said he loved me. 

I just don’t know how to get past the feeling that my empathy and kindness were completely taken advantage of — even during the times when he seemed stable. Did u get past that feeling after a break up? I poured so much of my energy into him that I’m completely drained, and I feel like I have nothing left from that relationship. And now, on social media, he has the nerve to make it seem like I’m the problem.";r/BipolarSOs;14;37;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o5o1z0/feeling_like_used_and_abused/
2025-10-14 00:05:23;Brutal Mixed Episode (Thank God for meds);"Hello everyone, just coming on here to say I'm having what I think is my first mixed episode and it is fucking whooping my ass. I'm extremely lucky that I've been on Lithium for like 6yrs (I have bd2 so I take a low lithium dose and its a godsend), I just got a new bar job, I have a loving and supportive partner + friends + family, so my life is not falling apart and I know it will pass....but no one gets it. 

I'm not sleeping because my thoughts are racing constantly and I keep thinking of random shit I can't get out of my head like how velvet is made or certain songs and then I spend the whole day so tired my bones hurt and bursting into hysterical sobs. I know its going to be okay, that I'm safe, that I've done everything right and I'm taking care of myself, but I can't tell anyone really how much it cuts me up inside to know that I'll be like this forever. I'll probably never be med free because I am so terrified of experiencing something like this without the meds to keep me stable. I'll always feel everything so deeply it hurts, even when I'm medicated and healthy and sleeping. 

I've been diagnosed for 10yrs, and I'm not ashamed AT ALL of who I am and how my brain works, but there's still something so humiliating about telling friends that I can't hang out or text back or do anything because I'm having an episode. I feel so stable that most of the time I forget its even there, and then I come crashing back to it and I think of all those times I've talked about wanting to get off my meds because I feel fine and I was so young when I was diagnosed and blah blah blah. God, what a fucking idiot. Thank god for my partner who lovingly suggests staying on the lithium, and thank god for the fucking lithium. I've been listening to a song called ""Adventures of The Invisible Dog"" and that's kind of what I feel like right now. 

Anyway, if you have any room in your heart and brain to think good thoughts for me, please do. Thanks for understanding when no one else can. ";r/BipolarReddit;7;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o5nvm5/brutal_mixed_episode_thank_god_for_meds/
2025-10-13 19:39:30;Loving as a bipolar;"I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since 2022 and have been on a couple of meds ever since. And one thing I have seen ever since the symptoms appeared in like my early 20s was that any time I feel like I need love or affection and when I go out of my way to express it to someome it has always been counter-productive. I love a lot, and I love too quickly (I also have borderline personality disorder) and often my idea of them in my head doesn't allign with what they might think or what's their priority may not be mine and that's something that compicates thing and there are the manic bursts to complicate things, when I be having those highs I would want all things good talk all things right and just want to love to the core but when it's the opposite I feel either I'm sunken to the core and something I just want is just to lay by my beloved and be there. And that's something which doesn't allign always with what they feel or their present state. And this thing complicates everything. The result short complex complicated relationships where everything is so ups and downs that it just feels me more broken and drained at the end.

They have been through so much this past year and I have been SO proud of how they’ve been holding it all together.

2025-10-13 09:48:36;i really don’t feel like i need meds/APs;"i *know* this is going to attract everyone going ‘if you don’t go on antipsychotics you’ll ruin your life!!!’ but i just. don’t agree. so, SO many incredible, historic, interesting people throughout history have been bipolar, either allegedly/suspected or actively diagnosed or treated for manic & depressive episodes. & yes, a lot of them killed themselves. but why does that have to be MY curse? antipsychotics are serious drugs. they have serious side effects and serious  consequences. & yes, i’ve had mild psychotic moments before, but if i wasn’t already diagnosed bipolar, nobody would blink an eye at me briefly thinking demons were after me or that i needed to end my life to escape to a dimension meant for me - how are those not natural thoughts in a world as incredibly fucked up and evil as ours is right now? why are *we* the ones with problems? isn’t being manic depressive just a natural reaction to a world as beautiful and as tormented as ours is right now? 

i have a lot of self control and i will never kill myself. maybe a lot of this comes from the fact i think i had a very early age of onset - i genuinely think i might’ve developed bipolar at about 12 years old, and as a result, i’ve had years to learn how to deal with it. my first and only real suicide attempt was age 13 and even that was half-assed, i wanted to die but i’m always aware of the fact my feelings aren’t permanent & im spiritual enough to think that it’s just not a feasible ending. 

i’ve been prescribed aripriprazole. i took it for a couple of days but i got really depressed. the next day i didn’t take it accidentally cause i forgot and i felt so, so good, it was beautiful. i’ve taken it today but i really didn’t feel good about it. i’m not anti medication. i’m just anti antipsychotics, at least for me. the side effects are too serious for me to justify taking them to control something that only happens to me like once a year. & yes, mania is serious and does happen to me but - is it really *that* pathological? the bad parts are when i spend all my money and annoy all my friends - but money is just part of the fucked up world we live in and my friends are just trying to dampen my vibrant energy. which is ok, not everybody can be like me. but. i don’t ever want to be depressed again but sertraline worked to stop my depression even though it made me quite manic. 

i know this is a really irresponsible post. sorry. i guess what i’m asking is, does anyone else resonate with this? does anyone Not Medicate themselves, or at least, not take antipsychotics despite having a history of at least one acute manic episode w psychotic features? of course i think everyone should take the meds they’ve been prescribed. it just feels different for Me. i can’t comprehend the idea of not being able to trust myself or my own grip on reality. i’m normally so self aware!! agh……..";r/BipolarReddit;0;49;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o56zfs/i_really_dont_feel_like_i_need_medsaps/

2025-10-13 02:46:22;I feel like i've fallen too far down the hole.;"I’ll start this out with I’m not specifically looking for supplement advice, not at all, I just want general advice more on how to either feel better or accept feeling bad.

For context I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 10 years old, and medicated since I was 11, I'm 18 now.

I have had rapid mood swings my entire life and I had never questioned them till like march of this year, and when I did question them, I started trying to self medicate with OTC supplements, starting with three, and then not very slowly making my way up to 22 pills a day- getting mad at myself when i still felt bad.

I’m not gonna list every supplement Ive ever taken on her but I’ve taken a lot, I havent thrown them out so I just have a drawer called “the graveyard” that is simply full of bottles of OTC pills.

when I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder I researched if anything I have been taking I shouldn’t be, or if anything would mess with the meds I was gonna start- and low and behold the ones I assumed were the most helpful all can induce mania

* \-Lions Mane
* \-Saffron
* \-Ashwa
* \-Creatine Monohydrate

I took them all out and felt worse, havent put them back in because my mood swings have been better, but recently all ive felt is depressed, detached, just all around un-ideal, I’m still only on the loading dose (25mg) of the Bipolar Meds, so maybe those symptoms can go away after a bit? I know nothing.

Ive still been taking Fish Oil, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin B Complex+ Vitamin C and I was consistently taking magnesium oxide but I switched to glycinate like 2 days ago because everyone said that was better- and it feels worse, my energy is just gone- so I’m wondering if I should just cut out magnesium entirely. 

I feel like- since march I have fallen down this pit of being absolutely unable to just let my symptoms be symptoms- if I feel bad that means that I’M doing something wrong, it cant be that I just feel bad.

I do kind of want to stop taking the supplements entirely, maybe not the fish oil or vitamin d, but I do kinda feel like I’ve been stopping myself from learning how to self regulate.

 I do really like how I look on creatine, and that, however strange, is very important to me, and also I know theres a whole argument on whether that actually induces mania or not. Maybe I just need to go to the gym more, should I put that back in?

I take currently 27mg of Concerta and 25mg of Lamotrigine  
All in all, if any bit of this post stuck out in any way, If you have advice I’d love it- should I take out every supplement?

Should I just wait till I increase my lamotrigine dose to see if that’ll actually help? What have you done to feel better?

Any advice you have related or not, I just got diagnosed, and I just started meds- what do I do- I’m a little lost.

2025-10-13 02:08:27;Anger/irritable behaviour;"Does anyone else have a partner or ex partner who would display irrational anger out of nowhere, over something very unserious. Extremely defensive behaviour arising from nothing. 
1. Sees a book in the home office and takes a personal vendetta against the book? You try and remain calm but they are escalating themselves. It’s a book about domestic violence, you have to reassure them it’s nothing to do with them, it’s for school.
2. Argues about you in increasingly angry tones about an issue you don’t care that deeply about… how human attraction works on different genders. An issue for a sociology classroom, not your car ride to the grocery store.
3. Angry about what genre of hot sauce/syrup you prefer. Out of nowhere. On a Tuesday morning. 
4. Breaks up every 6-8 months. Sometimes for days, once for a few months. Seems remorseful and regret filled. 

My partner (maybe ex) is only diagnosed with depression but I’m asking if this sounds familiar? The distortions in arguments, and arbitrary anger is always out of nowhere and usually accompanied by lack of sleep and inflamed by my lack of emotional engagement. I stay calm, and try to avoid the argument if I feel he’s in one of his moods, and it often makes it worse? He thinks he has undiagnosed autism and diagnosed depression but after the most recent discard I’m concerned it’s BP and looking for answers.

2025-10-12 20:16:27;I Think Lamotrigine Has Made Me Go Manic;"Not sure if it matters, but existing bipolar 1 diagnosis incase that’s relevant. 

Saw my psychiatrist back in June. I was having a depressive episode- but it was only a cognitive and energy levels kind of depression. Basically, I was completely dazed, couldn’t remember anything, sleeping all the time and answering questions incorrectly whenever my psychiatrist asked (my mother was there with me and had to interject). 

Started lamotrigine and slowly titrated to 200mg as per BNF guidelines. Antipsychotic reduced by half to help with sedation.

My mother asked if lamotrigine would make me tired, my psychiatrist said, “It shouldn’t but she might become a little bit flat.” The complete opposite has happened. 

I am cartoonishly emotional (not inherently a bad thing). I’m finding myself laughing a lot, gesticulating a lot, firing back funny and creative insults, being very irritable (feels like I’m overstimulated), saying things without filtering it through an internal self-checker, making incredibly impulsive decisions (a few near misses have occurred), being a little bit cheeky (usually a shy and timid person but tutting at lecturers and arguing with them in front of the whole class), and making inappropriate jokes which are really catching family members off guard. 

I kept calling the police because of arguments I had gotten into with a family member (I think the police are fed up with me at this point). I also opened 2 credit cards within days of each other. 

Essentially, I feel like a wild beast. It’s kind of fun, but I really have almost made life-ruining decisions (I was super embarrassed telling my key worker). I’m sitting at ~£1,000 in debt and don’t even know how (I haven’t purposefully made any “massive” purchases). I do have some recollection of purchasing gifts for family members, but I really don’t want to be confronted by my bank statements at this moment in time. 

This has been going on for months now. And it’s not just all fun and games. My mood is like trying to run on slippery ice. Sure, there’s a predominant euphoria (60%), some extreme irritability (30%), but also some intense distress (10%). 

The worst part is that I didn’t have insight- until now. It occurred to me a couple of weeks ago, “You know that thing we were working towards a couple of months ago? You would have completely ruined your life if you went through with that.” Even now, I’m too mortified to elaborate on what I was “working towards.”

Another problem is that my family think I’m hearing voices- which is kind of true. I have been hearing voices, however, I am Catholic and we do believe in demonic infestation. It could be that, but it also may not be. Catholicism teaches about demonic infestation, demonic obsession, demonic oppression and demonic possession- so I’m unsure about what’s happening here. I’m undecided about whether I should tell my mental health team about this. 

The good news is that I’ve been ringing my mental health team. I have an appointment with my key worker tomorrow. The bad news is that I cannot get ahold of my psychiatrist! I’m overdue an appointment. He keeps having meetings with my key worker, she tells him that I’m not well, but no appointments made. My mum rang his secretary directly, and they basically said, “She needs to bring it up with her key worker.” My mum said, “She has, multiple times.” And then the secretary was like, “We’ll ring you back.” They didn’t ring back -_-

The bad news is that I’m genuinely shocked by my lack of insight. I really had no idea what was happening until now. Even now, I’m not sure why I suddenly gained insight. 

If I have insight, there’s no problems, right? Nope, there’s still an issue because of the extreme disinhibition. I genuinely cannot control it. It’s one of those things that I can only recognise in hindsight. There really is no internal self-checker. I keep shocking myself by the things I’m saying/doing, but only realise this in hindsight. 

I wonder if this can be a genuine side-effect of lamotrigine. Anyone else have similar experiences?

2025-10-11 22:21:25;Stable but lost artistic abilities;"I feel nearly cured with the exception of losing artistic abilities

After years of mood swings, finally found a psychiatrist to figure out the chemistry of my meds. I have several underlying conditions that require meds as well so he has to check interactions etc. After years of therapy, people kept diagnosing me with OCD and depression. I find this doc and he's like nah you have BPII. I was upset with that diagnosis.

Here is the BPII med combo in case it helps anyone: anti epileptic (mood stabilizer) /2x a day and 50 mg SSRI 1x in the morning. He also added .25mcg of this common thyroid med as apparently thyroid has an impact on mood. My endocrinologist decided to up the thyroid med to .50mcg. Benzodiazepine .5mg as needed. Unfortunately I've been an insomniac for years, so I've been on a 2mg sedative-hypnotic since I was like 25 (prescribed by another doc initially).

I've lost all my artistic abilities but at least I am stable. I told the psychiatrist that I was unhappy with that result and he said I'd have to learn how to enjoy those activities again. Still hasn't happened....

I hate that trade off. Be stable with no passion to enjoy your strengths (for me, being a musician) ... or be hyopmanic and take on the fucking world.

So my meds are the reason I am stable.

But I kept thinking that maybe it wasn’t true. Like I’m also diagnosed with ADHD. And maybe this episode was just my ADHD ramped up because my wedding was coming up. 

About 6 months later, I went to a different psychiatrist that specializes in ADHD to re-assess me, thinking he would be better able to distinguish ADHD from bipolar. And even he diagnosed me with bipolar 2. 

So i have two psychiatrists saying I have it. My wife and friends believe I have bipolar, and even my mother has bipolar… so why am i still questioning my diagnosis. Like all that information strongly supports my diagnosis. But like.. I still feel like I was maybe misunderstood and my friends are just agreeing that I have it bc the psychiatrist said it. And maybe my mom’s bipolar was misdiagnosed because she has a meth addiction and many other mental health diagnoses. 

I want to stop taking my meds because I really don’t feel like they’re doing much. But I know that sounds insane

This is pretty out of character for me but in the last couple months ive been angrier and lash out in my personal relationships, but never in public. 

does anyone else mourn the person they could be and the person they’re losing to bipolar disorder ? i have these meltdowns and once im past the anger i feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. i always feel like there no point in trying to explain anymore because it’ll never make any sense to normal people. 

how do i even begin to address this issue, how do you move forward after these kinds of issues. i am trying to sleep and all i can do is think of that incident and i just wanna burst into tears all over again. how do you guys learn to give yourself grace in these situations ?  

any advice or related experiences would be greatly appreciated. i’d love to feel less alone because in my personal life i have no one else who shares these struggles. ";r/BipolarReddit;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o3qa4q/how_to_handle_bipolar_guilt/
2025-10-11 14:49:31;Bipolar anger;"

My husband has been diagnosed bipolar 2, and is currently in what seems to be a dysphoric hypomanic state.

Lately he is so incredibly angry at the drop of a hat, and if I say something that upsets him I can see him building up rage to the point where he's struggling to not punch something, starts screaming at me and leaves the house, doesn't talk to me for hours and the cycle repeats itself.

I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and I can't bring up ANYTHING to him that is not completely positive. I feel so disconnected from him because I can't communicate my feelings and needs, and I tried to tell him this, he got frustrated at first then exploded and left because ""I talked over the top of him"" I know I shouldnt but the reaction doesn't match what happened to me.

I feel so sad and lost, is this normal? What do I do? I've been trying to let things go for a while but it's just making me depressed and unhappy in the relationship not being able to voice how I feel.";r/BipolarSOs;8;10;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o3oqw8/bipolar_anger/
2025-10-11 13:13:14;the person i love the most hates me;"I just got my diagnosis. The antidepressants I started taking last year was making my hypomania worse but I've been depressed for so long I just thought I was happy for once. 

Until I relapsed. I go away for work over the summer, so 4 months out of the year I'm away at work. 

Long story short, I relapsed, and then completely lost it. Overdosed, that just made everything worse. My hypomania just turned into a huge manic episode. I got home from my job after being away for months and immediately left again, and I went and spent all my money, had sex with the person he hates the most, and kept doing drugs. I knew this was going to hurt my partner. I don't know why I did any of this. I just couldn't control myself. I couldn't get a grasp on reality I just had to cave into every impulsive thought. And I lied to him about it because I knew he was going to be upset.

I hate myself for hurting him. I wish i could go back. And I have no fucking idea why I did any of this stupid shit.

He hates me. And has told me this. He wishes he never met me... I wish I never lied, and I wish I never relapsed. 

I don't know who I became. I never want to be that person again. I fucked up the lives of myself and all the people I was living with because of my episode. I've lost friends and the love of my life. 

It hurts. I just want to fix all of this but there's nothing I can do. I regret everything, and I didn't even want to do any of it. None of it was worth it. I would do anything to get my life with him back.";r/BipolarSOs;10;10;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o3n422/the_person_i_love_the_most_hates_me/
2025-10-11 11:04:51;Newly diagnosed and hopeful for my treatment.;"I was just diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder yesterday at the mental health practice that I was attending for cPTSD therapy. My therapy sessions there were focused on long-term management of my trauma, panic attacks, and flashbacks.

For years, I assumed the manic episodes I had when sleep deprived from my chronic insomnia were just simple sleep deprivation. I had heard from a study on how long a human can stay awake that visual hallucinations were normal with sleep deprivation, and so simply assumed the black cat I saw darting between furniture out of the corner of my eye when I hit the 48 hour mark of uninterrupted consciousness was standard. My therapist shocked me by saying most people hit the visual hallucination stage of sleep deprivation at the 4 day mark, not the 2 day mark!

Suddenly, I was aware that the seemingly random hormonal shifts between depressive episodes and high energy rushes were more than just my ADHD making me hyperactive and my cPTSD making me depressed. Now that I've identified this, I can more effectively treat and manage it. My therapist is already planning to come up with a treatment plan with me at our next appointment in two weeks, which we hope to work on alongside my ongoing cPTSD treatment.

I never had any negative preconceptions about bipolar disorder because of how much I like learning about such things rather than just believing in stereotypes from the media. I'm hopeful about my treatment. Is there any advice that everyone here can share with me? I'm not looking for alternate treatments or lifehacks. Just, small bits of advice from those with experience having bipolar disorder. Thank you in advance!";r/BipolarReddit;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o3kt1v/newly_diagnosed_and_hopeful_for_my_treatment/
2025-10-11 09:14:58;Looking for support;"Hi I’m new to this group and just looking for encouragement and maybe advice. I’m sorry if I don’t word things correctly but I’m running on my last fumes and brain cells. This is going to be long so I’ll try to summarize as much as I can. I’ve been married to my husband for 14 years. He was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost 8 years ago and has been able to manage it pretty well with medication (Lamictal). He has experienced a few big episodes but they’ve been brief and usually managed if he stays away from alcohol. My husband is an amazing person. Loving, funny, hardworking, smart, and a wonderful father. This all has changed however and I’m heartbroken and lost.

About 7 months ago one of medications (abilify) refills lapsed and he was unintentionally off it for about 2 weeks. This sent him into a manic episode like he’s never experienced before. Not eating, sleeping, and just not acting like himself. His doctor recommended doing a dose and a half to get the medication back in his system and ever since then he hasn’t been the same.

He has completely withdrawn from me and for months was hardly interacting with our child. He would hide away in his man cave and lose track of time. He started shaking and twitching in his sleep. Then he started having auditory hallucinations and was hitting at things in his sleep. He’s been irritable and miserable to be around and completely engrossed in his phone. He eventually slowly went off the abilify which stopped the tremors but he ended up losing his job because he was unable to perform the basic functions of his job. He lied to me about it for over a month, which caused me to leave with our child when I found out (this is not the first time he’s lied to me).

Recently, he started to believe his phone has been hacked and that someone is going after him and is in our internet router. Trying to stop the hacker takes up most of his time and energy. Nothing will convince him to stop. He won’t go in to get his medication checked or talk to a therapist. He’s mad at me all the time and has said horrible hurtful things. He is mad at me for leaving but I couldn’t be with someone who lies to me and is constantly paranoid. I still let him have time with our child because I feel he is safe with her. He’s not expressed suicidal or homicidal thoughts so there’s nothing our local community mental health agency can do as far as getting him hospitalized. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I miss him so much but he’s not been himself and I’m afraid he’ll never be who he was again. He still hasn’t found work and I can’t afford to support him much longer on a single income. He’s about to lose everything he’s worked so hard for. His family lives out of state and he really has no friends to live with. I don’t want this person I love to end up homeless somewhere. Sorry this is so long but my heart is broken to see him like this and I don’t know what to do.";r/BipolarSOs;7;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o3inkd/looking_for_support/
2025-10-11 07:42:07;I thought cutting off friends was the “healthy” way of helping myself - sign of possible mania?;Well, I recently got a diagnosis of a mood disorder - pointing towards bipolar disorder. Honestly, I’ve been very reflective about it lately and I came to realize that in moments of outburst, I am very compelled to cut off friends. Just without warning or hesitation, and always regret my decision afterwards but it’s too late at that point. I now realize it is possibly in moments of mania where I’m not thinking straight and think that I’m justified in my decision (in hindsight, I’m never justified).;r/BipolarReddit;5;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o3gppb/i_thought_cutting_off_friends_was_the_healthy_way/
2025-10-11 07:24:56;on self-care and keeping your mind healthily occupied when alone;"Two different things, but I just wanted to share what resonates with me the most in this way, and hope you find this helpful if you struggle with either of these. I've been diagnosed bipolar 1 since 2012 or so, and I've struggled with self-care (especially by way of hygiene) for a while. I've tried overly planning my day, and having monumental routines which on paper look good, but seem insurmountable or unsustainable in the long-term. Like if I miss one thing, I feel like a failure. 

So I think going into self-care with a mindset of self-compassion and kindness toward ourselves is key. And I don't view it as an obligation, but instead as pampering. Well teeth brushing and flossing I see it as good for my health (I commit to at least that in my self-care), and I see showers as pampering, mainly because I get to put on my favorite scented lotion afterward, feel refreshed and clean, and sit in my favorite soft pajamas at night. My therapist thought of the word ""pampering"" rather than ""I should be doing it."" 

Now in terms of keeping the mind occupied while solo outside of work, I find that when I don't have an activity set up, even a relaxing one, I ruminate super easily and start to spiral. So I've now taken up drawing tutorials online, reading at night instead of scrolling, and playing my musical instrument. As someone having dealt with bipolar for a while, I find I can't just sit. Even meditation and being with my thoughts, or doing CBT thought records can be unhelpful. Opposite action I've found pretty helpful especially during my depressive phases. 

What kind of solo activities do you enjoy that give you more calm and peace to your day? ";r/BipolarReddit;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o3gc5y/on_selfcare_and_keeping_your_mind_healthily/
2025-10-11 07:08:38;tell me about your experiences with bipolar;"hi everyone!! i’m 18f and i’ve been diagnosed with bipolar as well as a myriad of other things. my mom has type 2 but my dad has type 1 (most likely, he’s undiagnosed but his sister + parents have it and he fits the WHOLE criteria). bipolar runs heavily in my family, and all the women for three generations before me have been diagnosed with it, so it makes sense that i have it. (necessary context: i have ocd and the following might sound irrational, but it’s been stuck in my brain and i’ve been ruminating; i don’t know anyone with bp other than my family, so it would really mean a lot to me to hear some different experiences)

the thing that’s getting me is that i feel completely unprepared for it to get worse. i’ve had mild hypomanic episodes a few times, but i’m quite experienced with depression, so that isn’t really what scares me because i have a good support system + am connected with mental health professionals. what feels the most frightening to me is that i know i will (probably) experience an actual manic episode at some point in my life, and i don’t know how to prevent that or know when it’s coming or get through it. 

my mom was extremely sick from her mid teens all the way up until her mid thirties (she has very few symptoms now) and hers got significantly worse as she aged until they lessened in her 30s. based on the horror stories i’ve heard from my family, i am very afraid to get any sicker. i tend to be impulsive and i’m really scared i’ll lose myself, hurt the people i love, or fall into addiction as i’ve seen many of my loved ones do. 

mostly i think i’m just looking for some reassurance, validation, and company. my experience of mental illness so far has felt unlivable, but when i compare it to the things i hear other people with bipolar talk about, i feel vastly unprepared and even a little naive; i’d like to hear about the things you guys have experienced and how bad it’s gotten for you, or how good you’re doing now and what’s worked for you, and any advice you have for me going forwards.

2025-10-11 06:44:13;ssri possibly triggering bipolar;"hi. i’ve recently been diagnosed with ocd, gad, and ptsd after years of putting off a diagnosis. with my ocd, i recognize that i have irrational thoughts about having other disorders, specifically bipolar. i’ve voiced this with my psychiatrist and she thinks it’s just rumination and i probably don’t have it. 

however, i started taking a ssri about a week ago and i thought it was changing my life and it felt like all my anxiety and ocd went away the first 3 days. i have had normal (?) side effects (nausea, shaking, sweating, insomnia, dry mouth, clumsiness, dizziness, restlessness, shivering, lower libido), but i also have been experiencing speech slurring, brain fog, memory gaps, and suicidal ideation. 

i can’t bring myself to care or worry about much, which is the opposite of how i am usually. ive been acting constantly excitable, happy, touchy, incoherent, and rude, as well as taking on too many jobs and work, being more reckless, and being more promiscuous or flirty. I despise acting too sexual, and i have a terrible fear of driving, both of which i’ve done earlier. i have no appetite whatsoever and im barely getting two hours of sleep a night. i can’t even remember if i was asleep or awake. 

my friend who recommended me to get diagnosed has kindly pointed this all out to me, and i got angry at her at first for even suggesting it. i was being paranoid and senseless. the reason why i’ve only talked to her, and why im posting here is because my psychiatrist doesn’t listen to me, saying i have to deal with this for at least two more weeks to make sure… 

i feel more conscious and thoughtful at the moment, and im worried i’ll become unstable and do something bad soon because i dont feel in control of my mood and myself. last night - which i can barely remember without even having any substances - i had a panic attack that made me pull my hair out and throw things and that shifted into suicidal ideation, which i haven’t had in many many years. ive been overspending and being way too demanding and irritable and impulsive. it got to the point where i couldn’t even form a thought this entire day as well as part of yesterday along with what could’ve been hallucinations. i feel overly emotional and grateful as well, and part of me doesn’t want to stop the medication because i feel really amazing if i ignore most of the rest of it.

i don’t know if i have bipolar or just a bad reaction to this medication, or if this is what i actually am and has nothing to do with the medication since it’s not supposed to have kicked in yet. my psychiatrist told me she would prefer not to see me for another week because she believe this is normal - “it gets worse before it gets better” - but i still have an appointment for tomorrow. i’ve been researching this on my own, but nothing really seems to match completely so im hoping for clarity by posting this here. if anyone could help i’d appreciate it a lot!

2025-10-11 02:50:28;Bf left me coz of son’s bipolar;I’m a single mom and have been dating my soon-to-be ex boyfriend for 4 years, and has been living at my place for 2 years. My son, now 15, was diagnosed with bipolar last Aug. Monday night, son felt like he was going insane, like he was going to burst into a mess, that he’s been feeling off for a while now, and asked that I bring him to the mental hospital. I got back at 5am exhausted. Bf did not and has not done anything to help, just a bystander. And only witnessed a morose or perpetually sleepy teenager. The next day, my bf said my son’s bipolar condition has been making him depressed, that my son is not getting better, and that our recent holiday in June was too much time spent with my son and he didn’t like it, even though son was totally compliant, just sleepy and low appetite dealing with new meds (added lithium to current aripripazole). So he’s leaving, gonna find a place to stay on his own. I’m left in shock and so much hurt that my innocent son has “inflicted” such misery on him, and that he had to tell me all the pain he had to go through tolerating the situation.

2025-10-11 00:28:09;Could I be bipolar? (Undiagnosed);"Ill try to explain myself as clear as possible. I think I might have bipolar ocd and ptsd and my doctors seem to think the same thing but still not officially diagnosed yet. At 11 years old, I started getting depressive episodes where I would want to kill myself and self harm and i would be really slow and everybody around me noticed that I wasn't okay. At the mean time, my family started having a divorce and my father was NOT showing mercy at all to the point he threw us out the house. I hated him back then but I love him now. Whatever. I would also get severely bullied and i also got SA d and 2 major earthquake events happened and ever since the SA and earthquakes i started having panic attacks and reliving the earthquake and the SA again to the point I saw the hallucinations of the man that SA d me. My father also used to hit me before he left the house, all I remember from my childhood is my father hitting me. Back to the topic, at the mean time those happened all at once and I almost killed myself a few times. But then my teacher said I should go to a psychiatrist and I went and she gave me fluoxetine and it didn't help me at all. It only made me numb. But then I left it and kept seeing depressed until I was 15 where I developed these other episodes that I think they are mania and the ocd, but im here to talk about the bipolar part so forget the ocd for now. In these new episodes I would be more energetic, FULL of rage, would see and hear stuff like ghosts, be impulsive, talk like there is no tomorrow, be hyper af.  And my friends and family again noticed how ""happy"" i was but I wasn't happy, I knew deep down it wasn't normal, that I wasn't actually happy since I still had suicidal ideations. Then I finally went to a psychiatrist at February and he gave me 5 mg aripiprazole and 2
5 mg olanzapine, only helped my ocd and I felt like it prevented my mania. Then he changed doses and nothing changed, and again, then he added SSRI s and they didn't help me either. Until August where I was at my highest intake of everything, 100 mg sertraline, 15 mg aripiprazole and 5 mg olanzapine when boom, im manic again. Im hearing and seeing ghosts having delusions thinking I talked to God but I also knew it was impossible so they didn't say much about it, was full of rage ,I was super emotional and all the regular stuff, my doctor increased my olanzapine intake to 10 mgs and stopped my sertraline intake and my other doctor said I might be in a manic attack and that I also had obsessions and that voice I thought was god were actually my obsessions. Also, my doctor sent me to see if I had epilepsy and I didn't. So he prescribed me a mood stabilizer called sodium valproate and GOD I have never been better. It's my 2nd week of it and I already feel great. Im happy without being hyper,im calm, im not ragefull. I feel...normal? Like, is this what normal people feel like? Its amazing! Yet boring too. But still, I can function now without any problems other than stress of course. I cant handle stress at all but thats a whole other topic I posted about.  So, tell me, can this be bipolar?

2025-10-10 23:36:35;Can someone be bipolar without being manic?;Sooooooo, kinda in a dilemma here. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with some kind of mood disorder - hinting at Bipolar disorder. But, the thing is, I’ve never had a manic episode. At least I don’t think I have. Sure, I’ve done things that have gotten me into a lot of trouble but I think that was done just impulsively. I do have periods of intense depression, though. But not so much episodes of hyper-activeness! I have episodes that’ll put me in a bout of depression, but I don’t think that equals bipolar when I have SO many external factors making me so depressed. Then when things start feeling lighter, of course I start being more productive. Idk, it’s all new & weird to me. You get what I mean??

2025-10-10 20:01:20;I’m worried my wife might be going through a period of Mania, but I’m not sure, and don’t know what to do about it.;"Hey everyone I (25m) am looking for some advice about my wife (25) of 8 years, and I want to make sure I’m reading the situation correctly. In short in the span of a few weeks we went from a loving happy marriage to one where she has filed for divorce and refuses to talk to me. This post is going to be pretty long, so apologies, but I really want to give as much context as possible. And sorry if anything sounds a little funny, I originally had written this for someone in particular. 

So I have been with my wife and have always supported her through many periods when times were dark for her, a while ago she was suffering from really bad depression and anxiety to the point where she was afraid of going to her college classes. She ended up seeing a doctor and I believe was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder, which at least in part stemmed from her childhood and her parents, further there are signs she likely has Bipolar disorder or BPD, as we had discussed it in the past and she has at times expressed feelings that are in line with it, however at the time she didn’t really discuss that with her doctor as she has a bit of a stigma towards that idea and originally had trouble accepting she suffered from depression. She tried a couple different meds but ultimately ended up on 100 mg Pristiq which she had been taking for over 2 years now. And looking back while it didn’t completely make her depression go away it definitely helped with her anxiety, and I think help stabilized her mood. However there was still periods of time, usually around the fall and winter, where she might still get a deeper depression. During these times she would get agitated, and express feelings about how terrible everything is, how she won’t achieve any of her goals, or how she doesn’t love me. She would also say that all of the times she was happy or was loving towards me was simply an really good act, and she never felt that way. However these periods would usually pass after a few days or a week, and then things would go back to normal, she would seem like a completely different person. Because this is very similar to some of the things she is saying now I looked into it more and I believe this is Black and White thinking, which is associated with depression and Bipolar disorder, this mindset was also prevalent to some extent in our day to day lives, for example if we where trying to diet or go to the gym. Most days however she was an incredibly kind, caring, and loving person. All she wanted was my attention and affection. 
 
I think it is also important to give some background about her parents as that is who she is with now, as they have always looked down on mental health problems and treatment and even disliked her being on medication and likely had a hand in her stopping it recently. A few years ago her brother took his own life, and when visiting they found her notebook that she had been using as an outlet and in which she had said she was having suicidal thoughts, her father’s response was to say that if she actually felt that way he would bring her out into the woods and help. In me and my wife’s limited discussions recently this moment got brought up and she actually called herself immature for having these feelings, something that made me concerned about the way she is currently viewing her mental health issues.


7 weeks ago we moved in with her parents to save money after college. Things were going alright, however she was expressing slight concern about if we wanted the same things in life, however we talked about it as we already had in the past and I reassured her we did, our plan was to save up some money and in a few years get a house and start building a family. After about only 2 weeks there, her father who historically has never liked me, without consulting her, forced me to leave the house but said I could come back in 2 weeks. And though emotions got high between me and my wife, before I left things were good, and she promised she would make sure I came back etc.  The first 3 or 4 days after being gone went smooth as well, we talked and things were alright, and completely normal, the last day things where like this she spent most of the day with family and got pretty drunk something she hasn’t done in years, after that in the span of about a day or two she suddenly got more and more hostile towards me until she no longer wanted to talk to me at all, basically becoming almost a completely different person and simply wanted divorce. This all took place around the same time she had just stopped taking her birth control, and was about to start weaning of her antidepressant (she unfortunately did not discuss this with her original doctor as she had switched to simply getting her meds online with limited interaction), unfortunately as I was always the one who reminded her to take her medication I know she was not taking them at all the few days before I left and for at least 3 or 4 days after, and since then if she was taking them it was very sporadic and at significantly reduced dosages, further as of at least a few weeks ago she had stopped them all together.

Over the last 4 weeks I have had trouble getting almost any information out of her, as she barely wants to talk to me, but the information I have got really concerns me. To start with when I went to pick up my stuff, she practically gave me 90% of her stuff as well, including things I thought were meaningful to her. She is also displaying much of the same black and white thinking as the past times in our relationship just to an greater extreme, saying how she has never loved, how I am to blame for every time she got depressed, and even that I was/am manipulative, abusive, just saying a lot of things about me and events in our past that are easily shown to be untrue, and even contradicting things she had said before she changed. She is also saying things with the express purpose of trying to hurt me, which for her is incredibly out of character. 

Another concern is that she told me she is having anxiety attacks and can’t sleep because she is afraid I’m going to hurt her or her future family. (I was forced to move back across the country and I have basically no money left, so not only is this not like me, but it’s also impossible) I know there has been at least a few other nights I can say for sure where she hasn’t slept, but it is hard to get any actual information out of her. She also told me at least one case of her getting overwhelmed in public, which she previously has not had an issue with since she started her meds, similar to the anxiety attacks. One issue of particular concern is that she told me how a week or so after I left she started talking with someone, who she apparently was not talking to at all previously, and told me that basically she has fallen madly in love with this person, they are her soulmate, she cant wait to have a bunch of babies with them soon, and told me how they were already being intimate over call. She has also expressed how she feels the happiest she has ever felt, and when we do talk acts with confidence and authoritativeness that is honestly very unusual for her. Further her memory doesn’t seem that great right now as the other day she unblocked me only to block me again and then claim it was the first time she blocked me at all, also when I’ve tried to help her log into something she accuses of me hiding or changing passwords, and doesn’t actually listen to my help, it feels like I am talking to a wall. With all that said to me it seems she is not thinking clearly and completely rationally at the moment and I’m worried she might be going through a manic episode.

Unfortunately I am not in a position where I can help her see a doctor or therapist and her parents would likely disregard anything I say to them. Besides that her support network is very limited and I don’t know what to do. I have been trying to reach out to her to convince her to take a break and reconsider things, even expressing concern. But I’m guessing it’s incredibly difficult if not impossible to actually get through to someone in this state. Do I just leave her alone let everything happen and wait for her to snap out of it I saw someone else say it can take 6 months? Even if it wasn’t for everything else I’ve said, it’s so hard for me to accept things being over when it happened so suddenly, no opportunity for discussion or attempts at working things out. In a way at least if she is going through a manic period than I at least have an explanation and I know it isn’t really “her” doing all of this. I could try to convince her parents to intervene but the likely hood of that is almost impossible especially without irrefutable evidence. Should I try to contact her original doctor at all even though it’s been about a year since she saw them, how does that even work?";r/BipolarSOs;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o2yyiq/im_worried_my_wife_might_be_going_through_a/

I'm not 100% sure what it is, because my partner isn't very open about that and I don't want to pry too much.

TBH it's been a emotional rollercoaster and it's been really taking a toll on me and I'm hoping if i get clarity about that it would help me understand my partner more and lead to a healthier and happier relationship.

2025-10-10 08:57:49;Overeating :(;"Soooooo I have been struggling so much with my weight and overeating while trying to find my perfect combo for medicine since being diagnosed with BPD in 2023. I think I’ve finally found my best balance with 300 mg Wellbutrin 400 mg Lamictal and 100 mg Topiramate. I haven’t felt this great in years and actually feel my episodes managed. 
But when I up’d my does of Wellbutrin from 150 to 300 I’m not even sure why but my appetite seem to jump like crazy, and I know that it’s supposed to curve it. It’s like I wake up absolutely starving in the morning and I feel like I have to eat until I throw up. I met with my psychiatrist for a month checkup after upping my dosage, and he told me to give it another two months to get it in my system. Since then I’ve gained almost 10 pounds.
I will say I’ve never had a wonderful relationship with food and struggle a lot with body dysmorphia, but it’s getting to the point where I’m eating to the point where I feel sick and I hate feeling like I can’t stop myself. I have the most supportive partner who never shames me or anything about what I eat or when I eat, and even helps me be more conscious of healthier options we can make (we both are trying to live a healthier lifestyle) 
I’m just not sure what to do. I’m having a meeting with my psychiatrist next month and I’m scared to change my regime because I’ve never felt so good mentally, and I don’t want to risk altering that is that make sense??? I definitely don’t want to start starving myself again, and I’m not opposed to taking more medication but at the same time I’m not sure the direction to go :(((";r/BipolarReddit;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o2n66d/overeating/
2025-10-10 08:35:42;Pregnant and not sure about it.;"I’m bipolar and pregnant. After years of trying (and it not happening), my partner and I had just started talking about using an egg donor — specifically one we could screen using whole genome sequencing for bipolar-related genes. We were planning to wait about two years to start that process (yes, I’d be 40, which I know is considered old!). Sods law, 3 days, after we make this decision which feels so good, I get a positive pregnancy test. 

I haven’t worked for the last three years due to the episode that led to my diagnosis. I was a freelancer before that and haven’t been able to return to it. I tried a few short-term jobs, but nothing stuck, so I decided to go back to university to study psychology. I’ll finish my degree and start my supervised year in the field, in two years.

This winter (Southern Hemisphere) has been really hard. I’ve been deeply depressed — ironically, mostly about infertility and how bipolar disorder has thrown my life off track. I’ve had periods of being seriously suicidal.

After everything over the last three years, I had finally decided to take two years for myself — to not stress about infertility or how unstable it’s made me, to finish my studies, and to focus on feeling healthy again. I wanted to stand on my own two feet and regain my sense of self.

Now I’m scared about what having a child could mean. I’m scared about my mental health. I’ve been on disability for three years, and I worry that I’ll never work again. It’s not even about the money — it’s about having my own place in the world.

I’m also scared of having a child who’s bipolar. I wouldn’t want them to experience the pain I’ve felt. I worry about what it would do to my mental health if I had a seriously ill child.

I posted about this in another group, and a lot of people said things like, “You’re 38 — if you don’t do it now, you might never,” or, “You should only have the baby if you want it.” But I think many of those people move through the world without a mental illness. I know there’s never a “perfect time” to have a child, but I worry that if I keep this baby, I’ll never get back to work and might end up on disability for the rest of my life. That my mental health that has been patchy at best might never recover. I'm scared about doing this after 4/5 months of serious depression. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe some others experiences with children, or life in general. Thank you x";r/BipolarReddit;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o2mppa/pregnant_and_not_sure_about_it/

2025-10-10 06:51:09;My psych thinks I might not be bipolar since I’ve only had 1 manic episode;"I had a severe manic episode in 2023 that lasted for 3 months. It involved delusions, hallucinations, and psychosis. I ended up involuntarily institutionalized for 9 days and was given a bipolar 1 diagnosis. 

Well, my psych (who’s been my psych for 9 months) keeps telling me that he’s “really questioning my bipolar diagnosis.” His reasoning? My medications. He thinks I would’ve had another manic episode by now based on my meds. I take 5mg Abilify, 50mg Topamax, and 25mg Adderall. He says this is NOT an appropriate regimen for someone “genuinely bipolar” and the fact that the 2 previous meds I was on (Zoloft and Phentermine) didn’t send me into a manic episode makes him really think I’m not bipolar. 

But what else would’ve caused my manic episode? And why is he so comfortable prescribing an “inappropriate regimen” to someone who has a history of a bipolar 1 diagnosis and a manic episode? 

Now I’m nervous that I might have a manic episode again. He says if I’m “truly bipolar” I would need to be on “much stronger medications” to keep my mania at bay. 

Does anyone know how true this is? 

Edit: he thinks it might have been substance induced psychosis since I was smoking weed and micro dosing shrooms daily (I read it helps with ADHD) ";r/BipolarReddit;29;44;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o2kg4v/my_psych_thinks_i_might_not_be_bipolar_since_ive/

I was made to think that I wasn’t trying hard enough at therapy, or that it was somehow my fault that nothing was working. Antidepressants helped others I knew with depression, but never helped me and I had no idea why. I felt so alone in what I was experiencing and that nothing would ever ease my pain. 

I was previously told ‘mood stabilisers won’t work’ and that I wasn’t bipolar because ‘bipolar patients think that’s they’re god’. They said ‘it’s just mood swings’. It’s not, it was so much more than that. Bipolar isn’t ’just mood swings’. It has left every aspect of my life in ruins, and almost erased it completely.

2025-10-09 23:10:02;Discard Grief/signs of mania?;"My 35f partner 44m broke up with me for the fourth time in four years of a relationship. I know on some level things are not well with him internally and it has very little to do with me because he had a massive fight with a family member just days before the discard. He does not have an official BP diagnosis but does have a depression diagnosis and takes himself on and off his ssri. Which is not helpful. 
    But I’m curious if anything sounds similar to BP mania/hypomania. Last week he was planning a vacation for us, and then on Friday he had a massive fight with an elderly family member who he claimed accused him of stealing (she did not, she asked him a simple account question). And he had no insight into how he was in the wrong, he slammed a door so hard he broke it and scared her. He left the family home, went to my house and saw some of our friends who said he was in an amazing mood and they’d never seen him so chatty. He stayed out that night and didn’t come home until 10 am the next day. Following that, the next day…he finished booking our vacation. And he disappeared for two days, then showed up broke up with me and said he had always had doubts about our relationship. This doesn’t match up with how he was speaking to me just days before. I’ve spoken with his family, they have a family history of bipolar, and have some suspicions that he has been struggling with this as well.

2025-10-09 22:48:00;19 Years Since My Diagnosis— Here’s my med regime;"19 years after being diagnosed bipolar, here’s where I’m at with my meds. I wonder what your personal feedback is or if there’s something I’m missing. FYI I am more bipolar type II but really just eternally hypomanic— irritable, argumentative, racing thoughts, pacing, little to no sleep, etc. That’s my baseline. 225 lb (100 kg) 36M.

1200 Lithium
1500 Depakote
100 Seroquel
2 Guanfacine
50 Nexaltrone (mostly for snacking)
1000 Wellbutrin XR (for weight)
2 Costco Multivitamins
2 Costco Fish Oils 
2 Melatonin

Seems to be working pretty well. Things that didn’t work: Trileptal and ADDERALL!!! Adderall made me crazy, literally.

This med set up has me sitting 50 lbs heavier than my natural weight, hence the diet stuff.

Life hack: I used to take them all at once and sleep for like 10-11 hours. Now, I take a little bit after every meal and save the Seroquel for dinner and Melatonin for bedtime. Everything else goes with breakfast or lunch. Now I sleep 8 hours on the dot.

2025-10-09 19:12:40;My brief story. (M24);"Hi guys & gals, 

I suffered a head injury back in may and this lead to being manic, I fell in love with a stranger, bought countless things and maxed out my credit card, starting preaching to everybody I knew and suddenly became religious at the time, had business ideas where I genuinely thought I could peruse the world successfully and felt unstoppable. This lead to me being sectioned and I spent a month on an acute mental health ward where I continued to feel on top of the world and still had all these ideas in my head. I was then diagnosed with bipolar. 

Before this I was a stoner for 7 years smoking every day, in the morning right through until the night time. Still managing to go through life as normal as I could. Going through half oz a week. I haven’t touched weed since may but I’d always been a hard worker as a solar panel installer and I never struggled to work hard, was always a grafter! 

Since my admission to hospital I have not returned to work yet. Been under a home treatment team where they’ve put me on Quetiapine, ever since then I have been a different person. Depressed for months and still going through a hard time. I struggle to get out of bed in a morning, I can’t do the hard work that I used to do and so anxious I struggle to even shower in a morning and feed myself. I’ve had all the support from my girlfriend of 5 years, friends & family and the mental health home treatment team etc but I cannot get back to how I was before, a hard worker! I feel the world is carrying on but I am staying stagnant in life. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience as no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get out of this depressive rut and I crave being manic again. I can’t stand being around people, can barely do the dishes without overthinking about a million things at once and constantly thinking about how I’m going to end my life, feeling suicidal from the moment I wake up to going to bed at night. I used to live a full life, I felt I was a skilled ambitious young man who could conquer anything. But now I feel as small as an ant and my life has completely changed. I feel I will never be manic again. Almost hard to believe I have bipolar. The darkness has taken over my life and I’d do anything to be the person I was again.

2025-10-09 10:04:43;I feel so lonely;"sorry i know i’ve been posting on here constantly, but how do you cope with the loneliness of it? i don’t feel like i can be honest with anybody about the extent of my disorder. i had a manic crisis, worse than anything i’ve ever had before, w some psychosis over the weekend and was nearly hospitalised - my housemates know about the near hospitalisation but not about the reasons. i’ve told 2 of them, my friends, that i have been diagnosed with bipolar but i can’t bring myself to explain the mania i don’t think they could ever possibly understand. 

obviously i don’t NEED to tell people things but it feels so lonely. most of my friends can barely understand depression, and the ones that can/have experienced mental illness still can’t possibly understand mania/etc. i have 1 friend w bipolar who i messaged about it but he never replied to me (which made me spiral SO badly but im working on that😭). a bp support group meets monthly in my area which i’ve been to once before and it was a huge comfort but everybody there is much older than me so it’s still a little alienating. 

even talking to my closest friends to say ‘hey i got diagnosed with bipolar’, which i have done, feels like too much. i just want someone to keep updated about my struggles with meds and my worries and talk to about whether i should take a break from studies and everything and the way my life is being uprooted but it feels like it’s too much for anyone to handle. on top of that i can’t tell my parents cause they’d freak so i’m just having to lie and act like everything in my life is fine when i talk to them. i just feel SO alone and isolated - this subreddit helps, but not as much as just having someone to talk to who got it in real life would help :(";r/BipolarReddit;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1o1tzvj/i_feel_so_lonely/

I'm diagnosed Bipolar and OCD, ADHD.

I've been prescribed 
•Lithium 1000mg
•Quetiapine 500mg
•Zoloft 200mg 

I feel my medication is working well my psychiatrist wants to make a few changes I feel ""stable"" he says I'm on ALOT of Medication with HIGH doses. 

I don't want to change the Zoloft and Quetiapine have been in my system for 2 years and 6 years when I was Diagnosed back in 2019.

I started Lithium this spring still early days but I think it's helping my mind 😅.

I feel mine is normal my psychiatrist doesn't.

So my question is what's your medication like or even do you agree with my Dr high doses maybe?

2025-10-09 01:43:07;Navigating divorce & custody while spouse is in apparent manic psychosis and untreated bipolar;"I’m looking for advice or experiences from anyone who’s gone through a divorce or custody battle with a spouse in manic psychosis from stimulant (Adderall) abuse. My stbx hasn’t been formally diagnosed with Bipolar, but multiple experts suspect it. His own “doctor” now claims to treat him for Bipolar, yet this episode has lasted over a year—and the last one (in 2023) lasted about the same before he finally went to rehab. At this point I don't know if it's caused by the stimulant abuse or permanent or untreated bipolar. 

Quick timeline:

* 2023: Quit job abruptly, fled to Mexico, DVTRO granted for me and kids. \*Before this he was extremely successful and I was a stay at home mom. 
* Late 2023: Entered rehab for Adderall abuse, left against medical advice.
* 2024–2025: Erratic behavior (extreme paranoia), DUI arrest, multiple court interventions.
* 2025: Medical leave from new job → 51/50 hold → court grants me sole custody and orders a psych evaluation. He has supervised visitation only. 

I’m emotionally and financially drained. I’m trying to stay grounded for our kids while keeping communication minimal and everything documented—but it feels like dealing with a stranger.

If anyone’s been through something similar:

* How did you handle boundaries, documentation, and safety? I still have compassion for the state he's in but he's impossible to deal with and making such poor decisions. Phones are always ""broken"" or disabled. Emails always changing due to paranoia. 
* How did the courts respond once mental health became undeniable? He has a good attorney that is prolonging the entire situation even though he knows he's unstable. 
* How did you keep your own sanity through it all? I'm doing EVERYTHING physically, emotionally and finically for our kids. 
* Any resources that actually speak to divorce when one person’s in psychosis or untreated Bipolar? Feels like this will be dragged out forever. 

He’s refusing to use family for visitation and only hires paid supervisors—burning through even more money after already losing hundreds of thousands. These court battles are going to bankrupt us but I don't know how to stop it. He's refusing any treatment and truly seems unaware of his condition.

2025-10-08 20:26:12;My partner changed completely after birth ,I fear it’s postpartum bipolar;"Hi everyone,  
I really need some honest advice. My partner and I have a 13-month-old baby girl, and since giving birth she has become a completely different person.

She has always had a slightly peculiar personality, emotional, creative and sensitive, but nothing like what’s happening now. Around eight months after our daughter was born, she suddenly said she didn’t want to be with me anymore. Since then she’s been completely unpredictable. She blocks and unblocks me constantly, cuts contact with her family and friends, and I never know when I’ll be able to see my daughter.

Her behavior is chaotic. She forgets things all the time, leaves the house and comes back several times because she forgot something, starts projects she never finishes, and often talks in confusing or incoherent ways. Once she even admitted that she hears voices. She barely sleeps and has bursts of high energy where she can’t stop moving or talking.

There are moments when I can talk to her completely normally, she seems calm and kind, but then usually in the evening or at night she switches into another state, saying things that make no sense, jumping from topic to topic, restless and disconnected from reality.

She’s also started posting strange Instagram stories that don’t make sense, random quotes about isolation, religion or “healing.” Out of nowhere she’s become deeply religious, talks about God constantly, donates money to the church and starts “spiritual” projects she abandons days later. Everything feels totally disorganized.

What really worries me is that she often leaves our baby with a neighbor for long periods. Sometimes the neighbor spends more time with my daughter than she does.

Her mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I’m afraid this could be postpartum bipolarity, but she refuses any professional help.

I feel helpless and scared. The woman I loved feels like a stranger, and I just want to protect my daughter and somehow help her get the support she needs. Has anyone experienced something like this? What should I do?";r/BipolarSOs;3;13;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o19159/my_partner_changed_completely_after_birth_i_fear/
2025-10-08 06:00:44;Wondering if any other Husbands of Bipolar wife’s have challenges bringing up tough topics;"First I want to say I absolutely love my wife. We have been married 20+ years and have had our ups and downs but have put legitimate effort into our relationship. She was diagnosed 10 years after marriage and considered some of our darkest times, but she put real effort into understanding BiPolar and taking her medications religiously (did go through a short couple months going off meds which resulted in really stressful times). 

My question is when things are stable meds wise PLUS being proactive watching and avoiding trigger situations do you find it hard to bring up issues like intimacy challenges or health/weight issues? There are times I want to be totally honest how I feel but afraid things will spiral into deep depression or some other unexpected reaction. 

I love her so much and see how much effort she puts into not falling into depression that I just cannot risk rocking the boat.

2025-10-08 03:58:33;Stopping one med;"Hi! First time posting. My husband is fairly newly diagnosed within the last year or so. He had several, what we now know as manic episodes including SI attempt when depressed and a near physical abuse toward our child. I don’t need the advice to keep myself and our children safe, I’ve got that handled.
He’s been stable on lithium and they added Seroquel during an inpatient stay and always told us it was more for sleep/anxiety which he used to struggle with but they added it during a manic episode on his lithium.
He has elevated liver enzymes pretty correlational to starting the seroquel. One doctor wanted to stop it but two others insist on him keeping it and it “couldn’t be the Seroquel alone”.
I’m in healthcare, I get side effects, I know it’d be a rare one but it scares him.
Flash forward, 3 weeks after we met with his doctors he felt like no one listened and he thinks his liver will fail etc.
He stopped the seroquel and I found out today- he’s been off of it for weeks. Still taking the lithium.
I feel so new to this and I always told him a condition of us managing this was to be honest and take his medication. I partially get why he stopped it, he’s scared and he does have elevated liver enzymes (he didn’t have previous to the Seroquel) and fatty liver on an ultrasound (again, nothing prior to Seroquel).
I just don’t know how weary I should be. I feel like I relate everything and every little issue to him being medicated or not now because I don’t know how we got here.
Not really sure what I’m looking for but I’m struggling with him being compliant with lithium but absolutely losing it over the seroquel and he absolutely will not consider staying on it or talking to a liver specialist.";r/BipolarSOs;1;13;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1o0pfzh/stopping_one_med/
2025-10-08 01:00:12;Thank you for helping me understand my brother;"My brother (age \~50) has been estranged from our family for about 2 years. I believe that his bipolar contributed significantly to the estrangement. The specific details of the story aren't particularly relevant, but I've come to understand that they more or less follow a pattern that's consistent with worsening bipolar -- He and his wife became very withdrawn during Covid, with increasing distrust of others; he lost his job early in Covid, which at first seemed like a blessing because he could spend time with the kids, but he became very sedentary and isolated; he looked for a long time for a new job without success, causing him significant stress; he had back surgery that was complicated and not very successful; his conversations with me became much less nuanced; he became very black/white critical of friends; he and his wife gained a lot of weight.  
  
And throughout this time, I sadly didn't see how depressed he was. It's clear in retrospect that he wasn't well, but I could write off each thing to the particular moment in time. The back surgery that would improve things. The backpacking trip he planned with his kids that would keep him busy while looking for a job (what a great adventure!). He was funny and loving with me. He didn't tell me about any suffering, other than specific topics like his back.

And then, seemingly out of the blue, he got mad at my parents for ""all of their toxic abuse"" when they ""pushed"" (his word, they would say ""encouraged"" or ""supported"") him to get good grades in college and forced/encouraged him to get a masters degree in his 20s. His version of this period of his life became a story about someone I didn't know! We went on a walk and I tried my best to understand his perspective. I thought I was kind talking to him, but I did ask questions and point out other perspectives. He has never talked to me again. He sent me a letter in the mail (certified!) telling me that because I didn't believe his version of his life I am complicit in my parents toxic abuse. I have tried several times to write letters to him and his wife to suggest family therapy, but I have received no response.  
  
Although we knew he was diagnosed with bipolar II in his late 20s, my parents and I hadn't understood well his mental health. He was diagnosed soon after marrying his wife, and they told us that they were responsibly managing his medication and care. I understood that my brother didn't want to be treated differently, and I respected that. I asked some questions but didn't pry.

Looking back, I wish that I'd asked more questions and made a plan with his wife for how to talk about his mental illness if things became more challenging. I think they might have been open to these conversations when he was in his 30s. It felt impossible at the time that we could ever get to a point in our relationship that would lead to estrangement. We talked frequently. Went on trips together. Babysat each other's kids. Made fun of our dad's weird hobbies. 

One of my brother's friends called me a few months after the estrangement. I'd known him since we were kids. He told me how sorry he is that my brother isn't talking to me, but also that I need to understand how sick my brother is. Turns out that he has been sharing more over the years with his friends than with his family. This friend knew so many details about the fragility of my brother's mental health that I'd never known. Worst of all, he was the only friend my brother had left from when they were kids. Everyone else kept only superficial relationships with him. They had all been turned off of him in one way or another over the years. I appreciated his call, but it left me devastated. I truly hadn't understood how mentally ill my brother was. With the benefit of hindsight, I can recall that in our conversations in which we each shared our flaws and worries, he always shared worries and laughter about what his kids were going through, or about his physical health. I somehow didn't notice that he wasn't ever really talking about himself, how he was doing.

I keep searching for understanding and peace. I've gone to a therapist, started attending church (not really for me, but I try), spend more time with my childhood friends. These things help. But I still search for understanding. I bet I always will.

Reading this reddit thread has helped. The experiences that you share help me to gain some understanding of the challenges that people with bipolar experience in middle age, with a spouse, with kids. I hope his life isn't too hard. I hope he is still finding joy with his wife and kids. I hope for so many things for him and his family.

2025-10-07 01:55:44;Spent weekend with bipolar sister;"Not my SO, but hoping to talk with others who have BP loved ones. 

My sister was diagnosed in her teens, and has always been very difficult. She was on serious drugs in high school and college, got pregnant at 20, etc. etc. etc. Nonstop drama and chaos. 

She has always refused to take meds, and is now 45. 

We visited her as a family a few months ago and it went well. It has been years since I have spent 1/1 time with her. I will only text - can't handle getting on the phone with her bc you can never get her off the phone. 

Anyway, went to visit her this weekend and she was a complete train wreck. I don't know how anyone can live like this! She picked a fight with her boyfriend and was 45 minutes to meet up, forgot to have breakfast, etc. 

The worst part was that we drove in her car for an hour. I thought I was going to die. She has blasting techno music and did not stop talking for an hour. Not even stopping to breathe. I kept turning the radio down bc I couldn't even interrupt her to ask her to do it. 

Her driving was erratic bc she was playing with her phone and talking nonstop. I went to w speaking event with her at night that was very quiet and intimate and she kept pulling mints out of her purse, gulping loudly from a water bottle, and fidgeting. It was so embarrassing. 

We finally ended up having a huge fight in public the next day. She said I was being mean to her. I told her she's just not self-aware. I really wish she would get help. But she thinks she's perfect the way she is. 

She's constantly losing jobs, getting into car accidents, and she refuses to get help or acknowledge she has a problem. It's so upsetting and infuriating at the same time. 

I was googling and read about ""pressured speech"" and this is exactly what was happening. Have any of you ever been able to get through to your loved ones and get them to understand and get help?

2025-10-06 18:52:58;Testosterone therapy triggering mania?;"I have been with my SO for 20+ years.  About 6 years ago he started having manic episodes, which eventually led to a bipolar diagnosis.  His episodes are always characterized by hyper sexuality, sometimes verbal abuse and aggression, and feelings of grandiosity.  At the same time he has low testosterone.  He recently came out of a very scary episode of mania, which triggered an extreme depression, feelings of suicide, and finally stabilization.  About a month after being stable, he started on testosterone replacement therapy (his t levels were indisputably low, and  he has been on therapy numerous times off and on), which seem to be triggering extreme hypersexuality.  He has always been a heavy porn user, but it seems he needs more and more extreme stimulus.  How can I determine if he's just hypersexual due to the testosterone, or if he is entering another mania?  For context, last week he started talking about etc supplements to help with bipolar.  He has now stated that because I am not interested and ""into"" his one very specific fetish, he can no longer have sex with me because that is the only way for him.   He is now talking about hiring a prostitue for sex, or offering to pay a cashier at the grocery store $500 for sex, and how sex is the only way to keep his bipolar brain healthy because it craves dopamine and how awful his life is because of his bipolar and sex is the only thing that makes him feel better.";r/BipolarSOs;5;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nzfrkt/testosterone_therapy_triggering_mania/
2025-10-06 09:26:46;He’s doing everything he should be doing and it’s an even bigger mess.;First time posting I think, but I’ve been lurking on this sub for years. I (42F) have been in an on and off relationship with my now ex (49M) for almost a decade. He has schizoaffective disorder or BP1 with psychotic features (I am not sure because it’s an old diagnosis), but anyway he tend to have psychotic symptoms before mood episodes and had to be hospitalized for mania many times. Over the years, he stopped doing everything that I thought was causing problems (like smoking marijuana). He’s very good at following his treatment. But the episodes are getting more frequent and worse. He cannot even work anymore most of the time, so he has no stress related to work. He broke up with me so many times over the years that I lost count. He begged me many times to move in with him only to cancel the whole thing just as it was about to happen while breaking up with me. It’s gotten so bad that now, if I dare to express a criticism regarding let’s say, the fact that he shuts off conversations about my feelings by faking having to go to bed or to the bathroom, he breaks up with me. It’s gotten so ridiculous that he broke up with me a few days ago with one text and blocked me afterwards. I know he will most probably come back miserable in a few weeks. I know it needs to stop. I understand it probably has something to do with his attachment style as well. My question is: how could it get so much worse even if he’s doing everything he should to be stable ? I kept reading about those things they should do to stay stable. When he was finally ready to do them, I was so happy. I was optimistic. But it got even worse…;r/BipolarSOs;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nz5zwe/hes_doing_everything_he_should_be_doing_and_its/
2025-10-06 09:02:19;Drinking water might’ve helped my bp bf.;"So, my bf isn’t medically diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, but his doctor did mention he might have it and that he’s genetically more likely to. For context, I’m currently 15w pregnant.

I just remembered he was at risk of developing extremely dangerous habits seemingly due to that almost diagnosis. It’s been about a week since I started drinking water more often, and I noticed that ever since I made an alarm for 9 am and every 2 hours after that, until dusk, my bf’s mood has gone way better. He’s not manic or depressive as much as he used to be. He gets up and continues his routine, and is genuinely happy and supportive.

Before my alarm, I was in my first trimester, and he would complain about everything. I mean, everything. not sleeping, making me food, how i gave my attention to the baby growing in me and not him.

But now? The alarms quite literally saved him. He’s waking up earlier, taking care of himself and me, wayyy less remarks about doing chores. And the best part? He’s not manic either, so there’s literally nothing to worry about! He asks me for permission for things he didn’t use to, (like touching me or moving me in a way that could hurt), isn’t so impulsive with his money, and he’s much more involved with the baby and his own personal friendships.

I did research on it ten minutes ago to refresh my knowledge on bipolar disorder and didn’t realize I did the one thing that helped him. I guess routine is a huge part of someone’s life! Can I be cited sources that might help me research a bit more on bipolar 1? 

edit: i realize i may have made the first trimester sound better than it was. No, in the first trimester, he was genuinely irritated, angry, and upset at everything, just to be happy ten minutes after when his attention spanned to something else. He was, at that time, a very big threat to my baby and me. and he knew it. i’m just super happy that i’m helping him recover. and for people that are like “he’s probably not bipolar then” we’re currently in the process of discovering and getting him medications!!

2025-10-06 00:52:29;The end;"I started writing on here about 4 or 5 months ago because I really thought my ex husband was going to come back. Its been 9 months now. My story is in my other posts. 

He had come back twice before so I think every cell in my body was anticipating that. We've been together for 29 years and I really thought underneath his highs he truly loved me, that we had an unbreakable bond, and that would be why he came home again. It was what he had said the two times previously. That his family meant everything to him.

But the months have passed, a horrible, bleak summer of waiting, hurting, and there has been no change. I hate the dark evenings coming as I feel so lonely without him. The coldness, callousness and cruelty have been consistent. He's 57. I think his mid 30's girlfriend is a big factor. It feels so wrong. That I'm saying the word girlfriend in relation to my husband and partner, my sons dad, that I've been with for most of my adult life. It is a horrible feeling. 

But I think the biggest factor is that this is his first medicated high on the wrong drugs - seroquel 300mg initially prescribed for depression when in a low at diagnosis, not a high. (It might even be less now.) And 50mg of zoloft, unnecessary now when he's definitely not depressed, pushing him up, keeping him in this heightened state where he is living his best life. I know now these should have been adjusted when his mood state changed. They weren't. I told him we needed to see his doctor when I saw the scary changes happening, like a runaway train, but he said it was not my business then.

Honestly I have felt like I wanted to die. The pain is so deep. I can't get past it. My whole life as I knew it has gone. He was a great husband for 25 years before this began 4 years ago. He now wants nothing to do with me. The grief is indescribable.

How can a good, moral, kind, loyal decent man, a great father and husband just disappear and become a cold, mean, 'cruel monster'? ( His words about himself when he was in a low and very sorry.) I do know why, have read so much about it, I know what happens in the brain, but it still continues to shock me as it also feel incomprehensible and impossible to come to terms with. It is the biggest loss. How will I ever get over it?

2025-10-05 23:12:28;ExBPSO recently had meds readjusted;"I marked this post as advice needed, and I'm going to preface this by saying I know I cant make anyone do anything in life. My ex is their own person and I can't force them to do anything. 



So my ex is 31M has been diagnosed as BP2 since 2022, and was originally prescribed sertraline 50 mg and stratera of unknown dosage. He took both for six months, felt baseline around three and then at that six months mark was full blown manic. He went off both cold turkey and his own decision and quit going to his med management appointments. Fast forward to late 2024 he is cycling rapidly between depressive and hypomanic episodes while unmedicated. He goes back to the same doctor and he tells them that the stratera was making him feel manic when they first prescribed it. But they put him back on the same thing. He takes just the sertraline this time because he thought the stratera was making him manic previously. Over the last year he has only been taking the stratera, and they have increased his dose and he now take 125mg everyday. He is still cycling between depressive and hypomanic states. He is now full blown hypersexual as well, having delusions, and is having periods where he just doesn't remember anything. 




I told my therapist all of this and she wants to know what doctor he is going to because she thinks way they are doing is wrong. 



She agrees that he sounds like he is on the wrong med, or not enough of another med like a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. 



I don't know what to do. It feels like he is lying about his symptoms and making it out like it's not as bad as it is. Or he doesn't remember the bad parts and can't give an accurate depiction of what he is dealing with with. 


We aren't married. I can't have him committed if he goes manic. ";r/BipolarSOs;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nyqsid/exbpso_recently_had_meds_readjusted/
2025-10-05 21:45:04;BP destroyed my marriage, but saved my life;I’m sharing this in hopes it might resonate with others and help in some way.  I was with my wife for 15 years.  We were married for 10 of those.  When we met, she was pretty open that she had been diagnosed as bipolar.  But she was medicated and regularly attended therapy.   About a year into our relationship, she became pregnant.  She had to stop the meds and stopped going to therapy for one reason or another.  Things changed almost immediately.  She was far more emotional, erratic, and prone to irrational outbursts.  She came into the relationship with two daughters that I immediately became attached to.  Naively I thought things would get better.  Even before we got married, I discovered she had been having some sort of relationship with a male coworker.  I could prove they had gone out together.  I could prove they shared a hotel room together.  Yet she adamantly denied things ever became physical.  No I never believed her and for reasons I still don’t understand I married her anyway.  The next 10 years was a roller coaster.  Constantly walking on egg shells.  Managing one episode after another trying to think of the right things to say and do.  Irrational outbursts.  Small things absolutely setting her off and becoming weekend-long fights. Being thrown out of my own home because the pots and pans weren’t put away correctly.  Even though I was the only one that ever did dishes.  The coffee wasn’t made for her one morning so that means I’m an inconsiderate piece of garbage.  Yelling at the kids for no reason and then threatening divorce if I even hinted at taking their side. After 10 straight years of dealing with this, I just got exhausted and stopped putting forth the same amount of effort.  Countless conversations.  Countless fights.  Countless tears.  Then I came home early one day without telling her, and caught her in the act with another man.  It had been going on for 2 years.  According to her it was my fault for not being a better husband, making her feel wanted, etc.  And she might be correct but it wasn’t for a lack of trying.  After dealing with the emotional and mental abuse, I just didn’t have anything left to offer.  I firmly believe that, while I admit I’m not completely blameless in the downfall of our relationship, that BP is to blame.  Without BP, I don’t think she ever would have made the decisions she made.  For the last year, I’ve battled severe depression and PTSD.  I’ve attempted to end my life 2 times.  The pills didn’t work.  The gun wasn’t loaded (I thought it was).  I joined the dating apps and slept with anyone that was willing.  I was doing anything I could to validate myself or fill the void.  I did not want to live anymore.  Even for the kids.  They would’ve been better off without me I thought.  About 3 months ago, I met a woman on one of the apps.  I thought maybe it would just be another hookup at best.  When I tell you that I fell in love with her immediately, I mean it.  I’ve been in love (I thought.). I’ve had crushes or been infatuated.  This wasn’t that.  I’m in my 40s.  I’m not dumb or naive.  This woman checked all my boxes and was just as into me as I was into her.  Every day since we met has been better than the one before.  She literally saved me.  I know it’s new, and there’s trauma-bonding etc but we’ve spoken openly and honestly about all of it and I believe in my heart and soul that she is my person.  We are perfect together.   Things can and will get better.  If you’re with a BP partner, and they’re not being treated, insist they seek help, medication, therapy, etc.  An untreated BP partner will likely lead to pain and heartbreak. ;r/BipolarSOs;28;14;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nyom6k/bp_destroyed_my_marriage_but_saved_my_life/
2025-10-05 16:41:20;My fiancée left me and replaced me in two weeks.;"Hello everyone, I apologize in advance if the text is a little long and sometimes difficult to understand; English is not my native language.

I was in a relationship and engaged to a girl who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her second hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital. We were apart the whole time. She didn't want to leave her family, her therapists, her cocoon. And I couldn't afford to quit my job and join her.

When I met my girlfriend, she had been diagnosed with depression. After her first hospitalization, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. On top of all that, she had a serious weight problem, gaining 40 kg in five months. During those difficult times, I never abandoned her, never criticized her weight, always comforted her, and showed her that no matter what happened, I would be there for her.

  
During our four years together, I was the one who visited her once a month. She never came to my place. I covered all the expenses; she never paid for anything because she was bad at managing her money.

After an argument where I said some harsh words because of all the pressure I was under from her, my work, and my family, she attempted suicide. She had to go to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I regret it because it was the beginning of the end.

During her first hospitalization, I was able to visit her because things were quiet at work. But this time, it was financially impossible. She only wanted me to visit during her leave, but she only had leave when I couldn't come. So I made the decision with her not to visit and to use the money we had saved to go on vacation together when she was discharged. She agreed.

It was hard for both of us and lasted 3-4 months. But we wrote to each other every day, and our love remained the same. I helped him pay his hospital bills. When she came out, she wasn't angry or sad that I hadn't come. We planned our vacation like young lovers.

Unfortunately, her grandfather passed away two weeks before departure. During the same period, she also changed her treatment. To take her mind off things, she started playing GTA RP, and we decided to cancel the vacation because she wasn't feeling well.

Despite the canceled vacation, I went to see her at her place for 10 days. We were going to celebrate my birthday, go to the movies, restaurants, etc. But I only stayed for 12 hours. She told me she didn't know if she still loved me, that I had hurt her, etc. She didn't break up with me at that moment. I was ready to take my things from her house just in case, but she stopped me, saying that we were still together and that she needed time.

72 hours later, the day before my birthday, she told me we were breaking up and that it was over via text message. And two weeks later, I find out what date she had with the guy she had a “role-playing romance” with on GTA.

I was devastated because she said it was all my fault. With time, things are getting a little better. It's been almost two months now, and I've talked to a lot of people, and they all tell me that I didn't do anything wrong and that it's because she's sick.

I would like to hear your opinion on this.

I posted a couple of weeks ago about my husband being diagnosed with bipolar. He was taken into emergency custody and placed into a facility. He was having a manic episode if not psychosis. He was paranoid and delusional. He was let out too early in my opinion. He's now on depakote and Zyprexa. He can't see a psychiatrist until October 16. 

Since he got out it's been a roller coaster. It is constantly one step forward two steps back. He stayed with his parents his first few days out. One of my conditions for him to come home was no marijuana. He smokes it for chronic migraines and other aches and pains (has a very labor intensive job). He gave his stuff to his dad to hold on to and I thought we had an agreement.

He got more weed from a friend days ago and bought a bowl yesterday and didn't tell me because ""he's a grown ass man."" I found out when I came home and smelled it in the garage. He didn't deny smoking it. He denies we ever had an agreement. He doesn't believe any of the information that says it is not good for bipolar people. It can trigger mania, worsen depression, interfere with their meds and increase side effects. I've shown him all the facts and he just rejects it. He tried to say it's like abortions it's his body his choice. I said not when it can send you into mania and it impacts our kids. He tried to compare it to meds I take for anxiety. He thinks I'm being controlling and threatening him. I'm not trying to be, I am trying to set a boundary for our children's sakes. 

He came home, got some stuff, turned off his location and left. I want to throw up. I keep questioning myself on if I am being controlling or unreasonable. I just want to give my kids a stable home. I don't understand how he can't see that and is willing to walk away from his family.";r/BipolarSOs;17;24;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nydjs2/marijuana_dealbreaker_unreasonable/

He was diagnosed with BP1 with psychotic features when he was 18 and I've been through numerous manic episodes with him, some induced by substances as he has struggled with addiction. Hes been on medication and was in therapy but has been stable over the last 3 years. However this most recent episode has left me confused. He had a lapse in medication in which he went without meds for 3 weeks during that time he was drinking daily and was sporadically using cocaine, eventually he was hospitalized. During his inpatient stay he noted wanting to work on things in the relationship and establish boundaries in certain areas mostly to do with my family (we live with my father and sister). This was a previous discussion so it wasnt surprising. However it moved from working on things to Im moving out when I come home. He came home but didnt move out he said he doesnt want to be hasty and wants until the end of the month, hes just been cold and distant and I learned he is now talking to a women he met while he was inpatient and is trying to get with her. This behavior is so unlike him but I dont know what to think, he wants to wait until next weekend to talk about if we are going to work on things but for the time being we are broken up.

Let's say an adult was undiagnosed and not medicated,  this person got into a very severe manic episode, then psychosis with hallucinations. Said person then went to the psych ward for 10 days, got diagnosed BP1 and started medication (no idea which ones specifically).

This person had a very severe manic/psychotic episode about 13 years ago but never got help for it.  About 3 years ago there was another rather heavy manic episode, not sure if psychosis was present, no help either.

This person has been taking meds for over a month, the hallucinations seem to be gone (but who knows) but the delusions are all still strongly there. The person is agitated, smoking weed (says the low THC kind, who knows if this is true). Hallucinations aside I don't see much improvement, still seems manic and delusional.

With similar circumstances how long it might take  to get out of the manic/psychotic state? I know meds can take time to work.  When mania will start to fade, is depression only to be expected or also a mixed episode?

Thank you so much.";r/BipolarSOs;7;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nx38oq/maniapsychosis_duration/
2025-10-03 04:54:20;My wife might be bipolar, and I don’t know what to;"I am in a state of shock and heartbreak, trying to understand a situation that has completely shattered my world in a matter of 6 days. I'm hoping someone here might have insights or similar experiences to share.

My wife has been diagnosed with depression and ADHD and was prescribed Fluoxetine  and Adderall. She has always been a person who needs a lot of sleep.

**The Timeline of Events:**

* **Early Sept:** She went on a trip to Mexico, stopped her meds for \~5 days, drank heavily, and had almost no sleep (including one 48-hour stretch of being awake). The poor sleep continued for the rest of the month, and she will go work out at gym at 5AM and 1AM.
* **Sept 15 - Sept 18:** She told me she was having a ""depressive episode"" and her mental is so bad ,and stopped her meds again for about 6 days.
* **Sept 22:** Things seemed normal. She came back from event with a gift for me, and we went out for dinner. Just a day earlier, she was texting me about having babies together.
* **Sept 23 (The Switch):** Overnight, everything changed. She told me she was no longer in love with me, that we were ""fundamentally different,"" and didn't want a future with me. Simultaneously, she insisted she still loved and cared for me and wanted to remain married, and still live as husband and wife and sleep together. That evening, I noticed she had zero reaction to our Emotional Support Animal (ESA), whom she normally adores.
* **Late Sept (Escalation):** Her behavior became increasingly erratic. She started spending compulsively on TikTok, which quickly escalated from $100 a day to over $1,700 per days in a few days. She accused me of being ""crazy"" and ""stalking her"" when I expressed my pain and confusion to her mother. She developed a relationship with a man on TikTok, whom she has now spent over $8,000 on. She has overdrafted her checking account,   maxed out all her credit cards, and applied for a 401k loan to continue funding this.
* **Total Life Change:** She declared that her previous life—her MBA, our stable future ,her promotion , her job ,no longer made her happy. Her new purpose, she said, is a ""free"" life of motorcycles and tattoos.
* **The Intervention:** I start collecting the evidence that she been cheating on me with a man she knows less than 6 days , and the crazy finance situation and then  sent them to her mother, a Registered Nurse . After initially being swayed by our wife's narrative, she saw the financial devastation and erratic behavior firsthand and became convinced this is a bipolar episode. My own therapist has suggested the same, and we learned her psychiatrist had previously prescribed her bipolar medication, though an official diagnosis was never made.
* **The Confrontation & Departure:** On Sept 30, her mom and I laid everything out—the financial ruin, the infidelity, she FaceTime and masturbate with the TikTok boyfriend, the severe lack of sleep , all the abnormal behavior she had. And told her she needed help for what we believe is bipolar disorder. She denied everything, said very hurtful things, and insisted her TikTok boyfriend was coming to NY soon so she needed to move out immediately. 
* **Now:** The very next day, I don't know why but she suddenly agreed to go back to her home state with her mom to seek treatment for two weeks. As she left, she was adamant that her decision to divorce me is final and will not change. She has since deleted all our pictures together on Instagram and is telling this man to ""start ring shopping.""

**My Questions:**

I am completely lost. The woman I love has been replaced by a stranger in less than 6 days. I believe that if the woman I married returns, we can recover from this 100%.

1. **Likelihood of Bipolar Disorder:** Given the sudden and extreme changes—impulsive spending, hyper-sexuality, decreased need for sleep, grandiose new life plans, and a complete personality shift after stopping antidepressants—how likely is it that this is a manic or hypomanic episode?
2. **Possibility of a ""Crash"":** My therapist mentioned that a depressive ""crash"" often follows a manic episode, which can bring immense guilt and remorse. For those who have seen this, how likely is that to happen after this period of destruction?
3. **Chance of Reconciliation:** What is the probability that after she receives proper diagnosis and medication, she will regret her actions and want to reconcile? I'm terrified that even with treatment, she will stick to the decisions she made during this state.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice, insight, or shared stories would be incredibly helpful as I navigate these next two weeks and beyond.";r/BipolarSOs;13;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nwfqoe/my_wife_might_be_bipolar_and_i_dont_know_what_to/
2025-10-02 23:57:49;Normal breakup or bipolar discard? Looking for advice;"Hello everyone, My (21M) story about my bipolar ex here is very similar to many posts on here but unlike others how we treated each other wasn’t black and white. If this post is all over the place I apologize for that but here’s my story:

For a TLDR this was my first serious relationship and I had a lot of trauma and behavioral factors that resulted in me being unkind and uncaring often that led me to hurt my ex a lot to the point she was told she was being emotionally abused, and while I don’t excuse myself my ex also didn’t treat me the best as often I felt she didn’t respect my time and would also be unkind and say mean things to me due to other factors. Overall in general I would say we were both terrible to each other but we didn’t intend to hurt and we kind of dragged each other down when things weren’t going well, but we both loved each other and a year ago we decided to fix the relationship together and commit to healing and making the relationship a much more safe space, and while it wasn’t completely smooth sailing we were both able to recognize each other making improvements and we felt happy that things were looking up and we would be able to focus on our future.

The situation started a few months ago when she was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 triggered by a family death, and she had a religious episode for a week. From this I told her I would support her and she said she came off her mania and committed to taking meds alongside her regular therapy. However looking back I was able to recognize that in the healing period I still had some shitty movements and furthermore I was unable to effectively support her in this new bipolar period as I said something hurtful and this made her realize she was fundamentally unattracted to me and only wanted to be friends. Initially she thought she was unable to date anyone but she was told by her therapists to try out dating someone other than me and now she is with someone else and told me she is much happier. This was over the summer period of 3 months and eventually before going no contact she said she only stayed with me because I was terrible, I always threw tantrums, she doesn’t love me anymore, I was always the problem, many other things. I now feel like she is just a shell of a person and isn't the girl I used to love anymore and she also just forgot about all the memories and what we love about each other when we were together, and just immediately moved on really quickly.

I have accepted that she may never come back and this period has been really painful, but mainly what I’m confused with is her 180 behavior from all this that may seem like she’s still having an episode but she is very confident that she isn’t and she is much happier, and many signs point to that being the case. I guess the million-dollar question I’m asking is is this a bipolar discard or really a break up from her end and I was just that abusive. I myself am self-aware that I was terrible and have hurt her but asking other people they said that I was not an emotional abuser (although I did bad things) and it’s not as black and white as my ex is making it seem, which is just compounding onto my confusion over all this. I am ashamed of my hurtful behavior and I don’t excuse what I did to her and while I do love her and wish her to come back, I’m just confused overall at what she is doing because while some things do point to a normal breakup, she is also saying many hurtful things that straight up contradict what she said in the healing period when things were going well, making it seem like a discard. So I’m hoping this sub will be able to provide some answers to give clarity to my situation and let me come more at peace over it being a bipolar discard or she was just trauma bonded for example and this is a normal break up.

Thank you for listening.";r/BipolarSOs;3;11;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nw7poa/normal_breakup_or_bipolar_discard_looking_for/
2025-10-02 22:26:25;BPSOs looking for a house without me while our relationships in limbo;"My bpso and i have been together for 4 years now. He got his diagnosis during our relationship and its been a ride trying to figure it out and how to manage it together. The first few years were amazing, it was love at first sight, i thought i found the most amazing man with all the qualities i could ever want in a partner, and we very quickly started talking about marriage and a future together. But hes already broken up with me 2 times before, both for the same reasons: he wants kids and a house and marriage by a certain age and because I dont have my bachelors and a steady job that pays me enough to help him out more financially, that means we are fundamentally incompatible people and he cant see a future between us. This was really surprising to me at the time because we had a conversation before we started renting a house together where we talked financials; he would have started renting a house anyway whether or not we were together and he knew i wasnt in a spot where i could help him pay the rent and since he had a well-paying job he agreed to support us financially now as long as I could help out where I could and in the future, I would be the main bread winner while he went back to school for his masters. When he broke up with me the first 2 times, he was going through a pretty bad episode that was triggered by a lot of work and family stress at the time. We got back together after his episode ended because he realized that he didnt actually mean any of the things that he said and that he wasnt thinking rationally at the time, and he promised to get a better handle of his bp and never treat me like that again. Fast forward to now, we've been doing great together, a few bumps in the road, but we've been able to talk it out. I'm 4 months away from getting my bachelors, and we're starting to talk about buying a house soon after i graduate, marriage plans in a few years, what having kids will look like for us, and we're getting more long-lasting furniture. Im trying to help out more financially but its been a difficult year for me in terms of getting jobs, i probably applied to over 200 jobs and heard back from 2 or 3. Hes been really understanding of my situation, and ive been doing several side hustles that have taken up a lot of my time to try to stay out of debt. Then 2 weeks ago, we have a bad 3 day vacation where I'm feeling nauseous, tired, left out, and neglected by him the whole time. Then I leave to help my sister move into her dorm for a few days, and hes left alone to ruminate on why i was feeling so shitty and was upset the whole trip. I think this was a trigger for him, because when I came back, it ended up being just like the last time we broke up, (hes tired of waiting for me to get my bachelors, im not helping him enough financially). We havent officially broken up again, but our relationship is in limbo. Hes looking for a house without me because hes tired of waiting, and ive had to scramble to find a job that would pay me enough to make rent payments in case he finds a house and moves in and breaks up with me or kicks me out. I can see that this is similar to the episode that he had last time he broke up with me, but i dont know if he sees it or is aware. I know that eventually this episode will end, Im afraid hes going to find a house and ill have to try to find a place that will take both my dog and i before the episode ends. Im not sure what to do right now, i want to talk to him about everything thats happening and this pattern of behavior im seeing, but im afraid that if i talk to him about it then itll make him withdraw from me more. So now im stuck in a house with someone that i love, who isnt physically or romantically attracted to me anymore and is actively trying to find a place for just himself to live even though just 2 weeks ago we were talking about getting married and finding a house together. Im so frustrated and have to idea what to do. Im trying to find living options in the area, but theres not much i can afford that will also allow a large dog. i want to beleive that maybe this will pass like it did last time and we can go back to looking for a house that will fit both of us, but now im scared that hes never going to improve or want to work on his bp symptoms and that if i stay with him hes just going to try to blow up our relationship again. im not sure what to do, i just needed to vent ";r/BipolarSOs;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nw59xv/bpsos_looking_for_a_house_without_me_while_our/
2025-10-01 07:23:38;Breakthrough mania;I’m at a loss here. I started dating my partner earlier this year so our relationship is new. He was super up front about his Bipolar diagnosis and how he managed it. He spoke candidly about how it has impacted past relationships and it was very clear to me that he was doing a lot of work to learn and heal. About two months ago a breakthrough mania came on. Does anyone else have experience with this? Medications have been adjusted and regular check ups with his psychiatrist continue but I’m not going to lie it has been so so hard. It’s like I’m in a relationship with a different person entirely, and he doesn’t quite realize it. I feel in over my head and sad about the state of things. I don’t hold it against him at all, because I know it’s out of his control- but I don’t feel like I’m getting what I need out of this relationship right now. We can barely have a conversation because his thinking is so nonlinear. There’s been a lot of upheaval in my life outside of this so I’ve been craving ease, quiet and structure which is the opposite of where he’s at. I don’t know if/how to approach it with him.

2025-10-01 02:09:29;I think my SO is hiding his diagnosis;My SO spilled his medications on the floor and I picked them up and found a pill I hadn’t remembered him taking I looked it up and it’s generic lamotrigine (lamictal). He’s been struggling hardcore with his mental health with no long term improvement for the past at least 6 years. Previously he has been on abilify, but the side effects were terrible. I think these put together means he’s hiding this diagnosis from me. (Which I can understand. I have made fun of celebrities for being bipolar recently).  There have been lots of issues that has led me down thinking he has bipolar in the past. But I had generally accepted that he has depression. ;r/BipolarSOs;9;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nukkkv/i_think_my_so_is_hiding_his_diagnosis/
2025-09-30 21:42:25;how to cope with the fact he will not remember the abuse, or see it as an “episode”;"my ex whom i dated for 3 1/2 years keeps insisting i broke up with him after “one bad month” and that he was perfect for the rest of it. mind you, i was only 18 when i first met him, and he was 21, it was also my very first time dating, while i was his 9th attempt at a relationship. he clearly knew better, and he even stated that he has had experience with others. he has also been diagnosed with Bipolar II since he was a teenager. the very first time i ever dumped him was because he went to get drinks with his ex and posted her on his story before he ever posted me, this was only three months into dating. he claims that he “hated her”, but in actuality, he actually cheated on her, and felt guilty about his past treatment so he maintained a friendship out of pity. he even pet sat her turtle and lied that it was for a friend. so i dumped him, and for three months he pursued me and claimed it “wasn’t like that”, but then on halloween he stayed in a hotel with her and his friends, and insists “it wasn’t like that, you really think i would’ve hooked up with my ex in a room with my bro?”. be so fr. but i was genuinely forgiving and believed his BS, so i took him back and we dated for a year, i even get him a job at a store i worked at so he didn’t have to relocate to find work. i would like to preface that this wasn’t a casual relationship at all, i introduce him to my entire family, and he did his. he posted me on my birthday, we even used to study together in school and tried making a cool project together combining two of our interests, art and computers. it was genuinely healthy, but now i don’t know if that was just him getting a high off being around a good girlfriend like me, or genuine love. then year two comes, and he gets an internship and leaves, this triggers my jealousy, since the last time we were separated he decided to see his ex. three months of hell later, he’s back. but then, he discarded me the day after my grandma dies, because i confronted him for following a ton of OF accounts. the other time was months later for still following his ex he claimed to “hate”. accused me of ruining his life, lied to me about staying in contact with his ex, and drinking and refusing to take his meds prescribed. he also experimented with illicit drugs three times since i knew him. and he claims to live a quote on quote, “sober life”. within the month after i broke up with him he moved in with his “girl best friend” he used drugs with because he ruined his relationship with his mother so she kicked him out. he also emotionally blackmailed me into giving him a job after he was unemployed for months. the breaking point when i finally said enough was enough, was when he has a “manic episode” 5 months ago, the night of my birthday and accused me of wanting to ruin his life, he said he hated me and drove me home erratically after a party, when i told him how much i hate men who drive like idiots in the past. then a week later, he asks me to let him stay in my home because his mother kicked him out. honestly don’t really care or want to care that he has bipolar, because i used that as an excuse to stay or justify his behaviors. i want to move on so bad, but i still check in on him, i guess i just wanna make sure he’s not torturing other people as well. presently, he keeps asking me to “come over to see that he’s changed” and that him and his roommate are “like cousins”. he also says that “my roommate made me realize i need to go back to school and take my meds”, and that set me off. i told him to do that for three years. mind you this girl he did cocaine with, and she has made comments in the past about wanting to go on a solo trip with him to germany, she also got a matching tattoo of a heart after he did, creepy right? i want to not feel resentful but i feel as if so many people on this page use bipolar to explain away clear signs of abuse. is it wrong to hate him even though he’s “ill”? his whole friend group coddles him too, like he’s somehow the victim.
UPDATE:
he wants to meet up with me in person to finally give me my long overdue birthday present, and “to talk” at this pond we used to discuss things at. i don’t even really know if i should go, cause i know nothing is going to come out of it. but a part of me wants to see if he even actually got me a present. should i go and bury the hatchet?

2025-09-30 11:56:14;Horrible Illness;"I left my BPSO in June but haven’t been able to completely let go. We were together 15 years and she had a major episode with psychosis that lasted pretty much all of last year. She came close to baseline in February then was rediagnosed adhd and started on adderall again. By May she had symptoms of hypomania and I made the choice to move out in June (feel free to read my other post). 

I heard from her sporadically all summer until August when I started hearing from her more frequently. Long rambling texts full of delusional thinking. In mid-August her father reached out and asked if I’d share background info with her therapist. I was more than happy to.

The therapist agreed it was BP and referred her to the psychiatrist in the practice. I felt reasonably confident she’d finally be diagnosed and stabilized with meds. Coincidentally, I stopped hearing from her in late August. I assumed the meds had kicked in? 

Nope. I heard from her over the weekend and she fired her therapist and doctor two weeks ago. She basically thinks everyone else is crazy. Still full of rambling delusional thinking and paranoia. 

While I’ve accepted I can’t be with her, I still care about her wellbeing. Hearing she fired her therapist/doctor and doesn’t accept she’s BP is just so damn depressing. She’s basically been suffering from mania/hypomania for 18+ months. 

I just needed to vent and be sad with people who understand how shitty this illness is. Our relationship wasn’t always sunshine & lollipops but I loved this girl and the person I knew just no longer exists. By the time she comes down from this episode she’ll probably have lost two years of her life to it. ";r/BipolarSOs;18;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nu37kw/horrible_illness/
2025-09-30 09:32:51;Life isfalling apart.;"Back in April, my wife was sent to a specialist through the VA to get diagnosed for BD, and since then, everything went to hell. She became closed off and distant, which would happen every now and then due to her also being diagnosed with MDD. She had to get a hysterectomy at the end of May, and we ended up having arguments after her surgery due to how she was treating me and our boys.

 At the end of June, I caught her texting another man, although I do now know what was sent as she grabbed the phone from my hands and deleted the texts before I could see them. She left that night telling her parents that I was screaming in her face. She filed for divorce on July 2nd. We talked on the last Wednesday of July , and she said that the specialist told her that I was being mentally and emotionally abusive and to reach out to other men to get her emotional needs met. During that talk, she agreed to come home and work on everything. The next day, she pulled a hard 180 and has refused to talk to me since. 

She is being so hostile and angry towards me. All I have done before everything went to hell in a handbasket is ask her to be honest with me, to not hide anything from me, and to talk to me when there is a problem.

 I currently do not have primary custodialship of our boys and only get them every other weekend and video calls every other evening. I am being treated horribly for fighting for my family and my marriage. From reading others' stories here, I believe she is in a severe manic state, and I am worried about her and our boys. She has a history of self-harm from before we got together, and she did start cutting herself at the end of April/beginning of May.

 What should I do? I do not want this divorce. I want my family back, and I want my wife to get the proper help she needs.

2025-09-28 23:22:51;Still upset. No consequences.;"Mini summary: In august my ex (BP1) of 9 years tried to kill me during psychosis, then I found out his fixation/stalking of another woman and cheating online. He took advantage of me financially and emotionally for all those years. He got diagnosed in the psych ward.



It's hard, I'm trying my best to get better, trying my best to get over all that. The few friends I still have said they are surprised at how calm I am, how well I'm dealing with all. I'm trying really hard. 

I managed to detach from my ex, I suffocated all my feelings and I feel nothing for him. I worked hard to get there. I have a very realistic view of everything. We are no contact and never spoke or saw him again.

There is something I'm still struggling with, hard. The feeling of injustice, the feeling that he did all he did and will never pay. He will never feel regret or remorse for what he did.  He will surely be acquitted at the trial cause of his mental illness. He still has his job, while I had to take a pause from working cause I can't deal with that.  

I know I just have to accept that, but I'm having an hard time.

He is still smoking weed, he is still having religious and erotomania delusions, he is still apparently out there looking for women. The fact that he manipulated his family and convinced them that weed is ok, makes me mad! He is still psychotic/manic and clearly the meds he is taking are not working well. He is agitated.  I know they take time, but so far they made no difference at all, if he is taking them correctly. I'm worried for my safety, for that of the woman he stalked and honestly for any other woman he might get his sight on. I cannot go report him cause he didn't physically threaten me or others. 

 I only wanted for him to be fully medicated, but no, I can't even have that. 

I'm sure he is lying to psychiatrists. I'm appalled no one asked to talk with his family or me, so we could tell them about his persistent delusions and the weed. No drug tests either. 

He almost killed a person and doesn't have a care in the world, he posts himself on socials clearly trying to get women's attention. Like nothing happened. 

If anyone dealt with the same feelings, please share how you managed to get over that. It's very hard to work on myself while dealing with that at the same time.

2025-09-27 11:45:52;persecutory delusions about a spouse;"
Hi all,

I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually lived this.

My wife had a psychotic episode with persecutory delusions about me ~1.5 years ago, and came out of it and we were back to being in love like normal. 

More recently she was diagnosed bipolar after further manic/psychotic symptoms. She accepted the diagnosis and meds for a while — then rejected it, decided I was the problem, and left. She’s masking heavily to others, telling people untrue/hurtful things, and wants a divorce.

If you’ve gone through something similar yourself (your spouse feeling you were unsafe/untrustworthy during mania/psychosis and leaving the relationship), could you share:

	•	Did those persecutory beliefs stick after the episode, or did they fade with time/treatment? How long did that take?

	•	If you reached out after they left to tell them you love them and don’t want to divorce, did it help or just make things worse?

	•	Looking back, is there anything they wish you had done differently that could have supported them or helped them see things more clearly? 

I love my wife and want to respect her boundaries, and am moving forward with separation, but I don’t want to give up if there’s something I can do that might matter in the long run.

Thanks to anyone willing to share.

2025-09-27 04:09:14;"First (or is it) manic episode; Discarding & scary life choices";"My SO has been diagnosed for more than 32 years—as a teenager. On Depakote & Lamictal. Has ADHD also (diagnosed in past three years). Was tapering Depakote with psychiatrist recs but suddenly went off all meds for bipolar. Was compliant with med regimen for the entire time I’ve known him, which is 25 years.

Based on him quitting his job overnight with no notice, along with other actions, I (and his psychiatrist) am concerned. Psychiatrist of 8+ years is careful not to use the words mania, manic, hypomania or hypomanic.

Since I already did not have a job, it was especially distressing that he quit his job with no notice. Now is planning to sue his company. He is very preoccupied and extremely angry with me. Prior to him quitting his job, he had other behavior that concerned me in mid-springtime. These actions coincided with heavy use of AI tools & believing that he was a super genius. His use of AI tools has only increased, and he believes he will get a lucrative job offer or sell his IP/new AI tools.

Yesterday his doctor told him to take Lamictal again. It seems like he won’t. He has another follow up with the doctor on Monday.

Is he manic or hypomanic? How can I tell? How can I help him? He hates my everloving guts. Since I’ve never seen him manic or hypomanic, I don’t know how to proceed. I am trying to use the LEAP method & not contradict him wherever I can, but he holds statements I made (when I didn’t really know what was happening with him early on) against me.

Please tell me how to wade through this. We have two kids together.

2025-09-26 17:18:55;My experience after a failed 10 year relationship with a bipolar person.;"My girlfriend of 10 years has left, for the last time this time.   
  
She has left me before, once because I asked her to puke in the toilet instead of the bath tub in case she felt like puking, once because I left a packet of ham partially open in the fridge, once because I wanted to talk to a friend after I and her had been out for the night. These are all things I can't tell anyone, because nobody would believe me if they don't know her outside of her masked life. Maybe in here?  
  
And the list goes on and on. But this time, it's final.   
  
I have had a mentally crippling chronic health diagnosis this year that took me a few months to be ok with, now in the past 2 months I lost all my savings due to tenants destroying my home (I work and live abroad and rent my home when we are not at home ourselves), then lost my job after giving it literally everything I could to keep the company running, and thus was about to become financially dependent on my girlfriend for the first time in our relationship.   
  
She makes good money now - when we met I supported us for many years before she got an education and a career. She fell many times, lost all her friends, lost many jobs - I've been with her through it all, and now that I really, really need help for the first time in my life, her decision was that while I was driving to the funeral of my father's wife she decided to send a text message telling that we need to split up and that I'm ruining her life by being sad. 

She says she has been trying to break up with me for the past 2 years, and that has been her story for the past 4 years now, that whenever she gets mad she has been breaking up with me for 2 years, so I'm not really sure what she thinks. She stopped taking medication 4 years ago, and only takes it for the depression, and says that it's what her doctors told her to do. My own doctors tell me it's highly unlikely that is the case, but she is unable to have a conversation about this. Since about that time, she has started to build up some delusional thoughts about our past and combining different conversations into one to justify ridiculous trains of thoughts to be mad at me.  
This is one of the sources of our problems: She lies pathologically. Not big lies, as far as I can tell, but every time we go out she tells a lot of stories during the evening. Things that happened blend together, people and places change to make the story relevant to the listener and so on. People most likely don't notice it because she changes friend groups every few years, but I've heard and lived most of the stories, and I know. It is very hard for me to not say anything about it, especially when she involves me in some of her stories, as lying is the biggest red flag in life for me, but she doesn't even seem to understand why I'm talking about it to her.  
  
Second major issue is that she feels like I have taken financially advantage of her by having her pay a part of our living expenses or having her co-sign a big loan that she insisted she do, so that we can ensure we get the loan, which I would and do pay for. She never paid more than half of her housing costs even when we lived in different places due to work.  
She ended up spending some of that loaned money too and paid less than 2% of the loan before the fighting over this became too much for me and I said that I'll just pay anything she wants, and if she feels like she has paid too much just to show me the numbers and I'll pay that as well. (more context to this loan to comes later in this post), and I've now been able to pay 70% of the total sum, but still 28% to go, and now being unemployed it can be a challenge.) This money was spent so that half of it went to pay off a big old debt of mine, and half of it was to be our buffer if anything happened. The money just melted away from the bank account, and to this day it's still a mystery to me where tens of thousands of that money disappeared. I'm not blaming her, we might have just spent it on food and stuff during the c-virus when both of us were not working, but this became a mental block for me and i'm physically unable to go to the bank account and make the calculations on where she/we spent the money. Again, one of the things I've been fine with, I've assumed she gambled it or whatever, it's just money and money to me is just a thing to get food and shelter with, ever since I've had a decent job I never really valued it the same way some people do. I need to have enough on my bank account, that I don't stress, so I can go to the store and buy what I want without looking at my bank account and it running out, but also I don't have a need to make the numbers go up in my bank.  
  
Now for the money context, When we moved to the country where I now own the home, we were renting a small place, and wanted more space. I suggested I could buy us a place. She wanted to also own a place, but she had 0 money to her name, and she was pretty unstable at the time, so I was hesitant to co-sign anything with her. I as a loving spouse entertained the idea, and looked into options, but obviously couldn't find a good solution to get a 0 income 0 education 0 job history person a loan on a house. I suggested that because houses (this is a housing company) need big renovations and they are done at the same time, we will need money for pipes and the roof at some point, and if she had the money and paid for those then, I could sell her a part of the property to cover the costs, and everyone would be happy. This would give her a good 5-10 year timeline to save money and own property with low-ish effort without having to pay a bank any extra for it. This is the deal we went with, and everything was fine. Thought I was doing her a favor, but boy how wrong was I.  
  
I sold my car, and spent all my savings to be able to get a loan and buy us a place to live in, so we could lower our monthly living costs (renting is more expensive than owning funny enough), and since she wanted to do a bit of touch up to the place by painting some walls and staircases and such she spent a bit of the money from the loan to get some paint and such put in. Since that she has paid about 1 months rent's worth of that loan, and she feels she is entitled to own half of the house, and that I promised that to her, and that i'm taking advantage of her financially.   
I have told her that if she keeps the numbers that she has paid for so far, I'm fine including them in the papers we make when she pays for the big renovations like agreed (so far she has paid a 3 digit sum, the house cost a 6 digit sum and it didn't start with a one), but she feels like I've somehow cheated her on this. It feels absurd to pour your entire net worth and monthly income to your combined life and then the other person genuinely think this.

I've spent all my money, time and energy on making her a whole person, and I've forgotten to take care of myself on the way. The beginning was a challenge, and the first word she learned from me, was cognitive dissonance, when I told her that she was the first person in my life who causes so high level's of that on me. How can I feel so strongly about a person whom I KNOW isn't good for me in the long term.   
I should have trusted my intuition - the relationship started to fail sometime when I started to give up on being a doctor for my girlfriend and started to demand basic rights in the relationship as well, and has been broken for a while now. I am not perfect, I can be closed down and tired a lot, years ago it even came out as anger or being mean, but this was 5+ years ago and I've been fairly zen ever since that if you don't count being quiet and sad alone being mean.  
  
She is almost impossible to criticize, because whenever I try to bring up a thing that we should work on, she attacks. I am very, very gentle with her, and I move away from the storms, and try to sail forward when the weather is nice, because when asking for things from her I need to be damn sure I'm willing to pay the price and put in 2x the effort that it will require from her. And this is not just in bigger things, it's also in small things. If I'm too tired to, for example take the trash out, and ask her to take the trash out, she makes sure that I need to then do that three times in the future because she did it once here, and this is just a simplification to outline the logic in her brain.  
  
Her way of dealing with issues seems to be get mad, forgive, but never forget. This becomes a problem in a long relationship, because every time something gets her mad, the list of insults and attacks gets longer. Its not very nice to hear monthly how you said something to make her angry 7 years ago, and how I looked at a girl 5 years ago, how you didn't react when someone said something that made her mad 2 years ago and how I'm disgusting and ugly and she can't even look at me (funny enough she has literally doubled her body weight during our relationship, and yes, fat is not attractive to me, and no, i haven't complained to her a single time about it, and yes, we have spent a lot of time criticizing my body weight fluctuations which are very minor compared to her's).   
  
My way of dealing with issues is by giving myself time to heal and take some time alone. And by alone I mean in another room or such, not leaving her. I'm a burnout and depression survivor who has gone through therapy and I have pretty good tools for mental health work for myself that work and i've been back up med free for 10+ years now, but yesterday I got re diagnosed with depression (though I personally think it's partially just due to natural state of everything crumbling around you and there literally being no way out unless someone just jumps in and offers to pay for my bills lol).  She interprets me taking some time for myself and refusing to be shouted at as a personal attack every time, even though we have been through this many times, and every time she says she understands me now, and then we just repeat. She is always welcome to talk to me normally, I just refuse to be shouted at. That is the #1 rule i have set in the house, if you want to have a conversation with me, you do not shout at me. rule #2 is no lying. and that it. that's all I want from a relationship. She shouts at me from the top of her lungs, I try to stay on topic, and when I say enough is enough and move away from the storm, according to her I'm practicing mental abuse towards her and that it is the worst thing I could possibly do. 

Somehow I'm glad that the relationship is over, it felt a lot like I was living my life just to fulfill my internal martyrdom. My father has spent his life giving to others, literally living alone in the middle of nowhere, giving everything he has to his ex wife, kids and new wife's family. He has always been the most selfless person I've known, and my mother on the other hand must have been one of the most difficult ones to deal with, so I guess I was dealing with my own issues too by being in this relationship. I was ready not to have kids. I was ready not to have a healthy sex life. I was ready not to feel secure in my life, and always question where she is going and whom with without ever having the ability to know, just so I could help her get a life worth living. 

To not make it seem like all dark, I must say that she has grown as a human a lot. The person she was and the person she is today are two totally different people. She doesn't have similar meltdowns as often as she used to, and she is able to handle herself a lot better in most situations in life, and she is a self sufficient adult most of the time now, which is great to see, and her whole family has thanked me personally for it multiple times. They know who she is and what she has been in the past, and they have been amazed at the change in her, that my therapist-boyfriend relationship and her growing up has brought about in her.  
Then again, this is probably the biggest reason I did not want to leave her - she has done a lot of growth, but falling to the sunken cost fallacy was another mistake by me again.  
  
In a sense I'm thankful that she broke up with me in this manner, at a time when I'm about to lose everything I've ever had, on my way to a funeral, by a text message, just to underline how far apart from what I expect to be a normal human being she is. Even if I know that the reality is that her mental health just couldn't handle being the pillar for the both of us, and this is her backwards way of telling me that, the way she handled this makes me think that If a person has any empathy for you, they just couldn't do it the way she did it. I feel like she waited for the absolute worst possible moment to do this just to ensure I start to hate her enough to leave her.

2025-09-26 08:34:22;New relationship with someone who has Bipolar I, not sure if I should walk away;"Hi everyone

I looked through posts on this sub but didn’t see much about *bipolar I* specifically, so I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with it in relationships.

Here’s my situation: I met a guy when I went to Kansas for my friend’s wedding. His family and the groom’s family are close friends. He was very intentional about keeping in touch, and now we’ve been texting every day for about three weeks. I’ve enjoyed getting to know him, he’s kind, attractive, and upfront. Early on, he told me he has bipolar I.

Some details:

* Even before we officially started talking, he told his whole family about me (that he met a pretty girl at the wedding, thats what he said to me). By day 2 of texting, everyone close to him already knew about me. I thought maybe that could just be a cultural thing since we’re from different backgrounds and hes really close to his family and lives with them at the moment.
* He’s tried quitting vaping before, but after meeting me he said he feels motivated to really try again. He’s been off it for over two weeks now, and my friend (who lives in his city) confirmed he’s serious. He said his mom has been trying to get him to quit, and she’s planning on *thanking me* when she meets me. I thought that was fast but no big deal.
* He told me he’s in a good place now, has been on medication for about 2 years, and is fine. He also mentioned that before he was diagnosed, some friends left him, but he feels better supported now.
* I did mention that I might come to his city for Christmas (which was already planned to celebrate with my friends), and he’s already told his family AND they’re apparently excited about that. I found it a bit fast, though I met his brother at the wedding and he seemed nice.
* He’s also really excited, already making plans to come see me, and even talking about booking flights and hotel, we live in different states.

We share a lot in common, and I genuinely like him. But I’m also wondering if there are early red flags, like how quickly he involves his family, and how fast things are moving. I’ve read here that safety and stability can sometimes be concerns with bipolar I but he seems consistent and grounded to me, and since I’m not from here and basically on my own in this country, I want to be careful.

I also came here because maybe my mind feels blurred and I can’t think completely rationally since we’ve been talking and FaceTiming constantly. We’re both 23, and I don’t know if I’m just caught up in it all.

At the same time, I don’t want to let a good guy go if I’m just overthinking. Has anyone here dated someone with bipolar I? How did it go for you?

Hes not currently diagnosed

symptoms include starting lots of jobs that remain unfinished (getting out personal mementos and leaving piles of them around which he never puts away), cutting the hedge at 6.30 am but cuttings still laying all over the garden, making breakfast and it sitting on the side for 60 minutes while he decides to empty the shed, spraying weed killer at 1.00am, little sleep but not tired (I’m aware he spoke of not needing sleep due to his military career but he left the military in 2000 and does have a regular sleep pattern outwith the periods of highs and lows), walking long distances with no plan which is unusual for him, he walked 18 miles overnight recently for no reason, he did the same in June, walked around 35 miles over 3 consecutive days again with no plan and on very little sleep and not being tired. Also wearing flamboyant clothing/badges, wanting to add 3 extensions to our home when we downsized to move here and they are not necessary, buy a £50k camper van and tour Europe, being overly sexualised and watching adult sex channels at 9am. Emptying all the kitchen cupboards in the middle of the night and being really irritable and angry when I ask him to be quiet as I’m trying to sleep at 3am, lots of other irritable which I’m happy to list. Once these periods end he is utterly exhausted and falls asleep randomly during the day despite sleeping well overnight.

It's clear my ex's family is very unsupportive of me -- they are ALL enabling and just want to ""respect his autonomy"" no matter how delusional his opinions re: treatment are.

At this point, given they were so emotionally unsupportive in this journey, I really want to detach and just cut myself off from all family. Can anyone relate? I really don't have any family support though as a result, like I'm completely on my own because my own mom died, my aunts and uncles don't want to get involved/live far away/have their own traumas and are no contact (have been for years), and my dad is mentally ill himself so I sort of cut him off (likely undiagnosed BP/BPD and low intelligence so he can't really contribute much anyway. He's almost 80 years old so he won't get diagnosed at this point, he's unmedicated). It really sucks. I just think I need to start over with a supportive community but I'm SHOCKED that everyone is taking his side.

I find that my wife makes plans with friends and stuff, thinking that she'll be able to do them, mostly weekend together at some location usually 4/5 hours away from our place. And last minute she goes into some sort of anxiety episode and she calls off the whole thing and stays home.  
(note: She's diagnosed, currently on meds, pretty much on an even keel most of the time)

It has happened a few times already, 1 out of 3 she goes thru this. Not sure if it's some sort of mild agoraphobia or she's scared that she'll come back completely drained, or what, and even she herself feels like crap bc of this. She reasons with it and there's no actual reason not to go, and yet she's too afraid of the physical and mental cost of the whole thing.

I'm your run-of-the-mill neurotypical guy who navigates through life pretty much effortlessly, whistling and stuff. So you could see that I have NO CLUE on how to even understand what she's going thru with this.

2025-09-25 15:04:29;Getting to “that” time of year and I’m terrified;"My husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after getting out of the military. He really struggled at first. 

He was getting drunk all the time, getting into bar fights, having mental break downs, attempts, depressions, fits of rage, and episodes that are kinda like panic attacks that would last for hours and I would have to calm him down from them. 

It was torture there for a bit. He would be horrible to deal with from September to January, and then he was fine for the rest of the year. 

After a couples counselor told his mom and I that we enabled him, and we had one really bad fight where I was going to divorce him, he decided to make a change. 

He went to therapy, sees a psychiatrist, changed his diet, started working out, started listening to self help books and podcast, and his life changed for the better. 

For the last few years he has been great. Lithium was life changing for him. Though he still struggles this time of year. 

It’s not as bad as it used to be thankful. From September to October he goes into a depression. Then in November or December he will have a breakdown or two, then he’s ok. 

This summer his psychiatrist switched him from lithium to lamotragine and I am terrified. 

He’s already been having issues, but to be fair we are going through a lot right now. He got injured at the gym and hasn’t been able to go for a month. 

His job slows down this time of year and he hates sitting there with nothing to do. 

My mom is dying and on hospice. I work full time and I’m in school, so I’ve been struggling dealing with this. When I’m upset my husband gets upset, so it’s just been triggering him. 

He’s trying SO hard to be supportive, but I feel like everyday all he does is complain about how he can’t sleep, he can’t workout, he’s worried about me, and the injury is triggering some anxiety. 

I’m terrified he’s gonna have a bad episode in the next few months, and I can’t mentally handle that. 

I’m already on the edge, and I told him I can’t be his support person right now. 

He is never mean to me, it’s just constant needing attention and validation. And complaining about everything in his life even though he has an amazing job, amazing friend group, a good support system.c and a good job. 

I am scared for my mental health if he does something this winter or fall. Like I’m scared it’s gonna push me to a point I can’t come back from. 

This is just so frustrating. I love the summer and spring where I get my fun and happy husband. The husband who sleeps, doesn’t complain, and lives a normal life. 

The husband I don’t have to watch like a hawk to check for signs of a breakdown. ";r/BipolarSOs;14;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nq00pk/getting_to_that_time_of_year_and_im_terrified/
2025-09-25 07:04:04;Help me please..;"I am wondering if my spouse is experiencing manic episode with Psychosis…
We have been together a total of 3 years and besides some communication issues and cultural differences, we were doing great, told his family he loved me and had never felt so happy before. He was an immigrant in the united states, and said he did not want to go to back to his home country, even days before he left (he ended up leaving in a panic, barely packed most of his things). He has not been diagnosed and he refuses that there is something wrong. 
 
Backstory: 
Around April 2025, he started having physical symptoms, like chest pain, stomach pain and it happened to get worse when he was anxious about something. He was paranoid that my parents were talking to people or conspiring against him, started questioning me, thought his friends were against him, his family, people at his job, anybody that he could think of, he thought they were doing something to him. He started acting increasingly paranoid as the months went on. He would have outbursts of anger over nothing, like the kind of milk I got, giving the wrong directions while he was driving, everything and he recognized this. He then up and left in July leaving me and his sister behind in America for him to go back home. Prior to him leaving he had crying spells, said he felt worried about me, would check if I am breathing when I sleep. He franticly checked for me one night (I told him I was upstairs), and said he felt someone was coming for me, he then started shaking uncontrollably and crying. In July he finally left after telling his whole family and I that he didn’t want to leave America. Now he is back in his home country, talking a lot about god (he was religious before but never spoke like this), if anybody tells him something is wrong with him he freaks out and says that we are all mental, not him. He went to the doctor but left stating that its his mom and sisters fault that he is sick and back home. He would one day scream at me saying he wanted a divorce, that everything was fake and he doesn’t love me, he blocked me for 2 weeks. He would move between his mom and sisters house, they called the cops but nothing happened. I went to visit 2 weeks ago with his sister, at first he looked cold, dark, and had this weird look on his face. He didn’t acknowledge her and told me I needed to leave. Then he spent a week with me, acting like his old self but also not. He would look dark and out of space, he would ramble about different things and say he feels like a million bucks, that he is stress free and so happy. He is still unemployed, which is not like him. He would say he wants a divorce, but wouldn’t follow through with it. Then again he would say it was fake and that he lied about loving me. Then when I left he told me that I needed to come back around Christmas, that he loves me and he will stay in contact. Now I have been home 2 weeks almost and I haven’t heard from him since this past Saturday. He hasn’t blocked me, but he hasn’t answered me either, he is weird about calling me or facetiming me.. keeps claiming it is because he needs to trim his beard and stuff, which doesn’t make any sense. He tells me that he is sleeping GREAT and overally expresses this any chance he can get, same with him being happy. His family expresses that he isn’t sleeping that well, he has been cleaning frantically and not acting himself. He hasn’t spoken to his sister who is very close with, barely speaks to his family, cut off close friends and has “new friends”. He was never a violent person but has shown that he can be violent towards himself and others. 
 
I guess I am just looking to see if maybe others can relate, what should I do, should I just try not to contact him? Does this sound like a manic episode? I want to involuntarily admit him but I am in America and his family there I don’t think want to admit him because they are scared I don’t know.";r/BipolarSOs;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1npqvha/help_me_please/
2025-09-25 04:55:22;Boyfriends mania got me arrested;"Hi Reddit friends, I’m completely at lost and exhausted. I f (30) have been dating my boyfriend (29) for about a year now. Several months into our relationship things became unstable and we broke up a lot of disagreements that stemmed a lot from his black and white thinking. Most of the break ups would come from him. I’m convinced he has some sort of bipolar disorder. He use to think the same but honestly developed a stigma towards it. A lot has happen the last month but the worst happened this past week. I will say he has been diagnosed with autism and also ptsd but I do see a lot of symptoms of mixed episodes as well. For example extreme irritability to being perfectly okay and happy. Hyper-sexual. Days of lots of creativity to days of just laying in bed doing nothing. Splitting on me and his close family. Aggressive behavior mostly verbal. Lack of empathy and self centered. Paranoia has increased a lot. I could keep going and I do realized some of these symptoms could overlap with everything else bese dealing with. This past week while siting down in my cat after smoking weed, he began talking about seizures. He lives with his uncle who has epilepsy. Then the next minute he tells me he is sure he is having one. I don’t recognize it, to me it seemed more like a panic episode. He’s also saying that he feels like beating up people for no reason. That same night he’s talking in loops and making no sense. The following days he’s a bit worst. We finally go to the ER to address the seizures he’s sure he’s having. They ran test (MRI and blood work) the doctor comes back and tells him he doesn’t see signs of seizures, to him it looks more like anxiety/ panic attack. He also notes that the antidepressant he began taking a few weeks ago may be causing mania. (Duloxetine) When my boyfriend hears this he explodes and tells the doctor he doesn’t know what he is talking about. Things get bad and security had to escort us out of the hospital. 

The next day he doesn’t get any sleep, constantly switching from smoking nicotine to cannabis. Both of us were very tense and stressed out. We get into an argument that lead to both of us getting physical. I had made an appointment for him to see his psychiatrist to adjust or talk about his meds. In the past he has asked me to help him with phone calls like these so I did it to try and help. I had to use his phone to try and find his doctors information. We are both very open about each other using our phones. I will admit while I was looking for his doctors info on his phone, my curiosity got the best of me and I snooped. I had seen an almost naked phot of him a few days ago on there that he never sent to me therefore bin was already suspicious. He realized what I was doing and absolutely blew up. He began yelling and saying hurtful things. I got really upset and yelled back. In the heat of the moment I shoved him. Now we are both very physical and we play wrestle all the time so for me in this situation of stress and all kind of feelings the lines between play and serious physical aggression were blurred. As soon as I shoved him he began yelling “you just fucking assaulted me” The situation did not calmed after this. I tell him to stop yelling and calm down that I was very sorry for touching him and that I immediately regretted how I acted. Nothing works he is still being loud. He gets mad that I ask him to quiet down and tries to leave. 

I didn’t mention that in the past two days he wanted to knock some random guys head off for looking at him weird. There was also an argument that let to him wanting to walk home which was fine until he grabbed a knife (for protection) he said to get home. 

My focused was to getting him to calmed down and make it to his appointment that morning. I tried to grab him from the door and in the process with out knowing or attempting, I leave small scratch marks on his neck and hand. After about seven minutes of this we end up in my porch and he’s even louder and aggressive. He keeps saying that he should call that cops. I shouldn’t also mention the last days he has been heavily projecting that I was being manic and that I needed to go to the hospital. So when he mentioned calling the police I thought it would be a good idea and perhaps they could do some sort of wellness check. 
 
So I agree he call. The cops get there, they hear both of our sides of the story and decide to arrest me because of the scratch marks on him. 

I was arrested and released about 16hrs after. He went to the court house and dropped the charges. In his official statement towards the end he said, “maybe next time make sure seizure boy isn’t a bit manic.” Wow the first time he has ever admitted to being manic. 

It’s been a week since this happen. I blocked him for a few days then he contacted me from a different number with just him being spiteful but saying he’s working hard to “unfuck my fuckups”
I frankly just want space to heal and to focus on me. For months I have been supportive and tried to hard to help him. It just feels like he’s a different person now. Thank you for reading my rant. I would appreciate any advice. Do I wait for him to get the right meds and work on our relationship or let go. I’m torn.

2025-09-23 23:28:08;Gf broke my heart, I don't understand;"!!!Trigger warning!!! Talk of suicide.

This is really long apologies but I feel the context helps paint why I'm so confused. My gf of like 9 months broke up with me a couple weeks ago. It was cruel, completely unexpected, and left me hurt and confused. I just don't understand what happened. 

 The start of the relationship was incredible and loving and I felt so happy and in love with her. We were flirty and caring and affectionate. In the winter she began to do badly trouble getting out of bed suicidal ideation. Everything became so hard for her. She often said she'd rather die. I took her to the hospital after she was not able to go to work for two weeks. She went inpatient and a hard time and said she'd rather die then do it again. although she got her bp2 diagnosis there and some pills that seemed to help a bit.

She continued to struggle running her business, working, hosting get togethers, and even hanging out with me became very hard for her and was with a lot of her saying she didn't want to do it but still did. She was missing only a couple days a month of work but they still got upset and eventually fired her. She lost her therapist and psychiatrist. She had some other set backs and really spiraled. Would pretty much only talk to me about how bad she was doing. Often only doing somewhat better when drunk and high. Which we both did often. There were still a few times I was able to talk to her about my feelings and we had productive conversations. 

Eventually she began to develop a situation with her guy friend who was also unemployed and had a lot of time for her. He told her he liked her. That's fine we were poly but she didn't have the space for that we talked about it. Eventually tho we were out for an event for her and went to a bar and she told me she was going back to flirting with him. She basically did not communicate about her feelings with him to me at all. I was hurt but didn't bring it up right away cause I knew she was doing badly. Later she told me she talked to her roommates about it but not me. She only told me to say she didn't like her roommates response. 

The last night we were together she was about to start a new job. Invited me over to hangout with her and the guy after I said I'd like to see her multiple times. I felt like a third wheel. She offered to walk him home cause we were drunk and I felt unconsidered. She asked me to stay the night but didn't even look at me after saying that. We talked later a bit later and she got upset and said ""Sorry ig I can't do anything right, I just fuck up, I'm a failure, I should die."" She continued ""you don't deserve this it isn't fair to you it's not okay"" I ended up leaving and she repeated that sentiment over text. Until I said I needed to talk about my feelings and communication. She said she didn't have space for that and reading it was too hard she had to stop before she harmed herself. She said she was just doing to bad and needed space for a week. I asked to met up and she kind of reluctantly agreed. I went over and told her the things I'd been feeling and thinking about mostly about that guy. Her responses werent very comforting and some of them betrayed that maybe there was more going on I wasn't aware of. At the time I thought it was just my own anxiety making me think that but I believe that was wrong now. She repeated the same ""I didn't deserve this, it's not okay to do it or fair to me, and I deserved better but she just couldn't really be in a relationship right now."" She said she didn't want to break up tho and suggested a break for a month to start her job and try to get into a better place so she could give me what I deserve. She suggested weekly check ins we talked and I left.

The weekly check ins didn't go well. We met in person after I asked about it and it started out fine but when I asked about her suicidal ideation she got upset said she didn't want to talk about it, that she's not emotionally available and shut down. She could barely look at me and asked to talk on the phone next time. The next week she messaged and said she wasnt up for the call and began talking about her Issues with her roommate. This was something she talked a lot about and before this roommate had a similar situation with her previous roommate. Finding offenses in lots of things the roomate did that didn't seem to be the actual fact. 

I was upset cause I wanted connection and she wanted me to idk validate her feelings more. Which I did everytime we were together. She would talk all the time about her feelings and issues and everything in cyclical patterns repeating the same things over and over. Nothing I could say seemed to help. Many nights she just got upset said she didn't want to talk about it anymore and shut down. At one point she said she just gets more angry when she talks to me about things. We talked about that and both seemed satisfied with the conversation at that time leaving it happier. 

I told her I was upset that she wanted to talk about her roommate and she said her roommates disrespect is why she can't get out of her crisis and that she just doesn't have space for my feelings or a meaningful conversation about our relationship. I told her I just wanted to connect, we didn't need to talk about her feelings or anything, I just wanted to know how things had been going with her business and work. She didn't reply and we didn't talk again until the day she came over to break up with me.

She came over and said that she needed the month to decide if she wanted to be together. This isn't what she told me when we started the break. She said i needed support, her to say she loved me, and needed her to be sad about the situation and and felt that it meant I didn't understand how badly she was feeling and that when she was reading the messages she had the pills in her hand to kill herself. She also implied there were other reasons saying she didn't want to be ""nitpicky"" or ""get into all of it"". She was very impatient and while I was thinking and processing, said that she ""didn't have all day"" glaring at me the entire time. I told her I hoped she'd find peace and that I loved her. She tried to leave I wanted to talk more but told her a few times I wouldn't force her. She left and I was devastated. 

I just don't understand what happened? There is so much that doesn't make sense. I have feelings too I wanted to connect I wanted to feel like a real relationship. I wasn't asking for much. She had been able to listen to my feelings in the past while she was doing poorly. I supported her so much. Making sure she was fed while unemployed, giving her money, helping with her business all the time. I did a lot for her because I loved her and knew she needed the help and support. She wouldn't give me ten minutes when she broke up with me and wanted to leave so bad. We were able to work through things in the past she had space for me even when she had just lost her job. She mislead me about her intention with the month break and I'm certain she has kept more from me. It just doesn't make sense. She was so cruel but used to be so loving. Did she really love me, did I mean anything to her, does she care? ";r/BipolarSOs;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nokh07/gf_broke_my_heart_i_dont_understand/
2025-09-23 09:31:50;Feeling empty and hopeless;"How many posts are here with the same title? We’ve been married for 12 years and ever since his diagnosis two years ago, I’ve just been focused on trying to support him, reduce his stress, walking on eggshells, etc etc. Now two years later, literally nothing has changed. Things are actually worse. I had made a post about it a couple months ago where he was getting physically aggressive to our child and now have cps involved. They’re still trying to figure out what to do with him shockingly, it doesn’t sound like they’re very concerned. 
I don’t feel the love anymore, I actually hate him now and feel completely empty inside. I read posts here about their SOs leaving and I know it’s awful and I feel for you but I really wish mine would. I’m tired and exhausted and again I feel nothing inside.

2025-09-23 05:08:56;When to have a convo;My husband (33) and I have been married for almost two years, and together for five. I recognized the signs and he was diagnosed bipolar 2 after I asked he talk with his general practitioner. They put him on lamotrigine in late 2022 and things were pretty consistent with manageable mania/depressive episodes every so often. In October 2024, things took a turn and he’s having episodes every few weeks or so. Talking about how miserable his life is, how he hates everything, he’ll never amount to anything. Then he’ll be fine and apologize and a perfect husband. He recently had one of the worst episodes of triggering anger over something so small after getting very drunk. He is also an addict to weed, alcohol and vyvanse which he is prescribed for ADHD as well. He cannot get routine down. I joined this Reddit today and it’s been so helpful to know I’m not alone. But I need help - when is the right time to tell him he needs to want to do/be better for this to work? I don’t wanna do it while he’s in a depressive episode. But I’m starting to lose hope - if I see him TRY to maintain routine and give up the substances, I’d feel like we can do this. So when is the best time to have a talk where I present him with facts and that I’m coming to him out of love and concern, not because I want to ruin his life? ;r/BipolarSOs;14;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nnyofh/when_to_have_a_convo/

2025-09-21 04:31:59;Fiance recently diagnosed BP and General anxiety disorder;"My fiance (31F) has been dealing with some mental health issues off and on since she was a teenager, and more so on since we had our daughter 4 years ago.  She's recently been on some antidepressants and anti anxiety medication,  I forget the anti depressant but the the anti anxiety is klonopin for what it's worth.  She recently underwent an extensive psychiatric evaluation and the results came back with the diagnosis of Bipolar and general anxiety disorder.


The BP diagnosis honestly surprised me.  Im obviously no medical professional whatsoever, but reading about it and being on this sub the last few days, the diagnosis still surprises me.  Yes i feel recently she has had periods of ""worse"" depression than normal, but nothing crazy...she's always functioned, she's a stay at home mom.

I do understand BP is progressive, I do understand everyone's symptoms are completely different, and i understand that the diagnosis process maybe complicated.  What im not seeing in her is necessarily any mania/hypomania.  Honestly just confused about it, and i know she is too and now more down on herself just with the diagnosis herself.

2025-09-19 06:48:41;Able to mask psychosis?;"I am fairly certain my sister is bipolar and is in the midst of a pretty extreme manic state. She has made mention of depression and bipolar before but I don’t believe she is medicated or seeing a psychiatrist.

We are trying to get her involuntary committed, but the issue is she somehow acts relatively normal when talking to doctors or police.

However, we have witnessed extreme psychosis - delusions, paranoia, hearing voices, seeing things that don’t exist. We have even been able to record some of these episodes. Has anyone else diagnosed with bipolar been able to hide much of their behavior in certain situations? She is also very angry and aggressive, and she has a more difficult time hiding that.

2025-09-19 00:27:41;How to tell my SO I think he is bipolar;"Starting off by saying this is a throwaway account due to obvious reasons. As the title says, I think my boyfriend is bipolar. I’ve scrolled this sub and every time someone mentions their SO entering mania, I find myself going “yep that’s him for sure!”. 

A little back story: He was prescribed adderall 3-4 years ago for adhd. A few months in, his parents sectioned him because he was having auditory hallucinations, becoming aggressive, wasn’t eating or sleeping. I don’t know the full story since he doesn’t talk about it much and have only recently gotten more details about it from his parents. During this hospitalization, the Dr diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. He claims that his Dr never properly diagnosed him and came to that conclusion from talking to him for only 2 minutes. At the time, I had believed him but now I don’t think that is exactly what had happened. 

Fast forward to March of this year. My boyfriend is prescribed adderall again by a different doctor. I thought this was great because I could see that he was suffering from his ADHD symptoms. A month later he goes into psychosis and suddenly walks off from his new job because he thinks his coworkers are talking behind his back and are out to get him. He saw one of his coworkers at the gym and thought that coworker was going to try to fight him. During this time, he thinks I’m cheating on him and was trying to find ways to leave him. All not true. After talking to him about this, he agrees that it’s probably the adderall. 

Fast forward to July. It’s like my boyfriend is a totally different person. He’s still taking adderall, if anything he is taking higher doses. He’ll stay up 48+ hours at a time, speaks quickly in circles, will have multiple thoughts at once, aggressive mood swings, and get aggressive with me (non violent). He’ll stare at me with these deadpan eyes and it honestly scares the shit out of me. I end up sectioning him and he’s in the hospital for 2 1/2 weeks. During his stay, the Dr brought up how he was diagnosed as bipolar from his last stay and wanted to give him valium while he was there. He denied all of it and that was the end of that. 

He’s now back with me and I can instantly tell he is not truly with me. As soon as he got in to the car he got sexual extremely fast. The whole hour long car ride he was trying to touch me and expressing all of his sexual desires. It’s not like him to do this so explicitly and while I’m driving. He’s been home for 24 hours now and he’s just even more manic than he was before. He’s talking about spending all of his savings on anything he wants, working for NASA, and becoming a musician. I’ll watch his eyes dilate and quickly return to normal as different thoughts enter his head. It’s starting to get a little scary because I’m watching someone I love immensely go through something they don’t even know is happening. 

I guess now I’m asking about how to go about this. I know I can’t force help on him if he’s not willing to receive it, but I don’t know how to suggest it. Have any of you been through this? 

TLDR: Adderall heightens bipolar symptoms, I think my boyfriend is bipolar and I don’t know how to suggest that to him.

2025-09-18 10:47:50;Bipolar spouse?;"hello. So Last year my spouse had what appeared to be a psychotic break. He quit his job, left our home for 8 weeks, spent 50k. I had no idea what was happening. He is retired military and when he returned home, he was diagnosed with ptsd and put on an ssri. He was crying and sorry and as his wife for 20 years, I felt like I needed to stand by him. 

 In May I noticed things seemed off. He had secretly stopped the sari. He was pushing me away, being distant, telling me he is training for.the CIA with no documents to back that up. By July he quit his job again and told me he was getting a huge government contract. He ended up leaving again, flying to Vegas and spending a few thousand while I moved our youngest into college. He started staying in a tent and tried charging 20k to our credit card at the mall. He also tole my neighbor he was on the path to being president. I ended up getting him put in a 72 hour old where the psychiatrist diagnosed him with bi-polar 1. He left there, no longer speaking to me, and went to his normal psychologist and they did a 2 hour assessment and said he is not bi-polar. 

Meanwhile, he left the state we live in, applied for food stamps, unemployment and is living on his brother's couch. This was a guy who was making a ton of money after the military. He said he is divorcing me, my daughter stopped speaking to him and he said he is now training to be an actor which is part of his cia training. My daughter tried to reason with him and he explained he is finally living his authentic life. I am just at a loss here.....like what just happened to my life? He has been deemed fine from all sorts of doctors.. Is he fine? This is just his authentic life? After almost 22 years of marriage, a pretty good marriage too. I am just so confused. Can anyone relate or help me out here? Is this not bi-polar can he really fool all these people? I am questioning so many things.

2025-09-17 11:20:07;Bipolar I & Narcissistic Personality;"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wsP7zhrLE

Hey all,

My husband was diagnosed with bipolar I not long ago, but before his diagnosis, I always thought there was a personality d/o, either borderline or histrionic (I’m a social worker so I work in mental health). This was a really eye opening video from psychologist, Dr. Ramani, about the overlap in the two disorders, although one is categorically a mood disorder and the other a personality disorder. I always wrote off many of my husband abusive tendencies as a part of his manic episodes, but I think that if you’ve been very confused by their behavior, and if they’ve been abusive (mentally, psychologically, physically, emotionally, etc.) that watching this may be eye opening. Of course, this is not at all about every person diagnosed w/ bipolar, but it’s good to understand.

2025-09-17 04:07:19;Been together 10 yrs, admitted cheating 2 years ago while manic, before diagnosis and meds;"Been with my fiancé for 10 years. He just admitted he cheated 2 years ago with a coworker (3–4 times) and lied about it until now. He says guilt has been eating at him, that he’s lost some love/connection over the last couple years due to us being more distant, but also says he does love me, I’m his best friend, and he wants to try to reconnect and do couples therapy, and continue individual therapy, to work through things and rebuild.

Backstory: the last few years were rough. He was diagnosed bipolar last year, and his meds finally stabilized what we now know were manic/hypomanic episodes going on for long periods after being put on a med for anxiety. He's been on meds since last year. Started individual therapy a month ago, hasn't mentioned this there yet. Back during that time he was reckless, not acting like himself, personality changes, got high again after years of sobriety (he’s a recovering alcoholic), racked up thousands in debt, missed tons of work, bought guns and drove around with them, lied randomly, was erratic, and distant. Our intimacy also suffered, he was out of the usual sexually driven, and I wasn't feeling it due to the fighting. That same time frame, was when the cheating happened.. says he was confiding in her about our problems at that time, flirting, and that led to her wanting to hook up and them doing so 3-4 times.

He swears he hasn’t cheated outside of that time frame, says he has no urges now, and never did the 8 years before that. We do share locations now due to things unrelated to this or trust, and until the manic times, I would have never believed he’d betray me especially at this level. He's usually the guy who'd call out his buddies for being cheaters instead of encouraging etc, he also took his sobriety very seriously before manic then (he's fully sober again now) He says he couldn’t cheat again because he couldn’t live with hurting me again or anymore guilt than he has now and that there's no desire there anyway.

We were literally planning our wedding and discussing trying for a baby when this came out. I’m devastated, we’re also financially, logistically, and emotionally tied, and he wants to work on things. I’m open to trying right now, but part of me is of course unsure and very hurt and wanted to hear if anyone here has been through similar as I know cheating/mania/bp can sometimes go hand in hand. Has anyone stayed and made it work after something like this? What actually helped? I'm telling you his character, and morals, I would've NEVER seen him do this to me, same with the other things he did during those times, everything was things completely out of his character.

**TL;DR:** Fiancé admitted to cheating 2 years ago during manic episodes (3–4x with coworker). Says he regrets it, wants couples therapy and to rebuild. I’m devastated but we’re tied together and he wants to try. Has anyone actually worked through something like this successfully?

2025-09-16 20:33:48;The friend I called sister for 11 years is gone;"I’m still trying to process what happened with my best friend. We’re both in our mid-20s and have been inseparable since 2014, like sisters. We’ve shared high school, university, moving to a new city as roommates, relationships, breakups, and countless personal struggles.

She’s always had ups and downs with her mental health. Her dad is bipolar, and she’s been on sertraline since her teens. She got diagnosed as bipolar this summer, after many years of struggles. Despite that, during school and university she was very social — we traveled a lot and had many friends. Over the years, though, she lost many friendships because she’s a poor texter and struggles to maintain relationships. I was the only exception for 11 years.

Things started to spiral in 2022 after her parents’ messy divorce — her dad cheated, her mom lost her job, and she got caught in the middle. Around the same time, she went through a traumatic relationship while studying abroad. Throughout all this, I was her main support system, the only person she confided in. Looking back, I realize my role wasn’t healthy — I carried the weight of her problems and often worried about her safety.

This year, things changed further. After months of cheating on her boyfriend, she met someone new, ended her previous relationship, and immediately started a new one. From that moment, she became almost unrecognizable. She stopped calling me, isolated herself from friends, lost focus at work (eventually getting fired), and devoted herself entirely to the new boyfriend. She also began drinking heavily while on medication. During this period, she completely stopped asking me about my life or how I was doing — every conversation, every interaction, became about her.

Since February, I’ve been living abroad, so I hadn’t seen her much. When I returned at the end of June for the summer holidays, I realized how serious things had become. She was extremely thin, barely eating, and even her mother said she rarely saw her because she spent almost all her time with him. I tried to confront her, but she’s very non-confrontational, and little came of it. We still texted daily, but only saw each other once before our planned holiday.

At the end of July, we had a one-week summer holiday planned with another friend. I hoped it would be a chance to reconnect, but she left two days early because she couldn’t bear being away from her boyfriend. That hurt deeply.

I decided to pull away for a while to protect myself. After weeks of no replies from me, we finally met for lunch. I hoped we could talk openly, but she avoided the real issues and focused only on her bipolar diagnosis. I told her everything I was feeling. She said I was like family to her and that she never wanted to hurt me, but didn’t explain her actions, only adding, “If being bipolar means losing people, then I will accept it.” I left feeling confused and frustrated, realizing she wasn’t willing to face what had happened between us.

After that, I learned she had been telling mutual friends that I was “crazy” and controlling. Hearing that broke me — after 11 years of friendship, it was shocking to be misrepresented like that. I reached out one last time, explaining how much I was hurting and asking her, at the very least, not to speak behind my back. She briefly suggested meeting up before I left again, then disappeared completely, leaving me with no closure.

Now, I’m left feeling confused, heartbroken, and struggling to recognize the person I called my best friend for over a decade. Has anyone else experienced something like this? We were so close, like sisters, and it’s so hard to accept that she’s no longer a part of my life. Common friends tell me she's always been like this, and maybe it's true, but not with me.";r/BipolarSOs;9;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nig70m/the_friend_i_called_sister_for_11_years_is_gone/
2025-09-16 17:09:52;SO has lost touch with reality;"My spouse was diagnosed with Bipolar II a few years before we got married (we've been married now for 11 years) and I knew going into it what I could expect, as bipolar disorder runs in my family and I have had plenty of exposure.

We are currently separated (for about 2 years now) and preparing for divorce--unrelated to his bipolar disorder--so what I'm about to talk about are things I have picked up on through phone calls, text messages, and emails.

A few months ago, he had some kind of religious experience, and as far as I can tell, this is where the trouble began. I feel like I should have seen this for what it was--a delusion that has just grown into a monster. When we would talk on the phone he sounded mostly lucid and in control of his mood, if perhaps slightly manic, but at the time I attributed it to religious euphoria (which a lot of new Christians experience).

Things started to get out of hand not long after this. He became combative with his parents over their political views and after a time, he refused to speak with them, choosing instead to email them preachy messages and instructing them to read a certain article or watch a certain YouTube video and then report back to him about what they learned. He said he would not talk to them until they had changed their opinions.

Around this same time, he told me that he was going off his meds (lithium and bupropion) with the support of his psychiatrist. I was skeptical of such a statement, but I saw the same psychiatrist for awhile and he was always flexible with me about my own meds and when I thought it was time for me to reduce my dose and eventually get off it, so I thought it was plausible that he might be supportive of my SO getting off his meds too.

Since then, his manic episodes have become more frequent and more extreme, while his depression episodes are shorter than they have ever been. He's been rapid cycling for the last couple of weeks, but things came to a breaking point this past week.

One day last week (Thursday, I think?) he sent me literally hundreds of text messages in the space of two hours, many of them just a few words, but some were these huge walls of text that made little sense. I only replied to him twice, once to tell him I was busy getting ready for work and that I would call him later, and then to tell him that his messages weren't making sense and that I thought he should get in touch with his psychiatrist and get back on his medication.

This definitely set him off, and he started texting me that I needed to quit my job and drive my car off a cliff because if I didn't get right with Jesus that none of those things would matter because I was clearly going to go to hell. When I called him to ask what the actual fuck he was talking about, he said ""figure it out and then talk to me"" and told me that he didn't want to hear from me by phone or text until I figured out whatever it was he wanted me to figure out and took some kind of action that he never specified to me.

At this point, I started texting his mother to let her know that he was having some struggles with his mental health and that she might want to check on him. I also called the police department in his town to ask them to do a well check, in hopes that he could be talked into going to the emergency room and sent to a crisis center nearby. He then texted me to tell me ""I just convinced a cop that I'm fine"" but couldn't grasp that I had asked the police to check on him, he seemed to think God sent the police to test him.

I figured by then that he was simply not going to be receptive to anything I had to say, so I called his psychiatrist's office to let him know what was going on. I don't know what became of this effort, but he has not gone to the hospital or crisis center and has only become more untethered to reality. I blocked his number on my phone to relieve myself of the perpetual onslaught of text messages, and left him blocked all weekend.

Late Sunday night, I got a voicemail from him, three minutes of him rambling nonsense, interrupting himself mid-sentence to change topics, and the central theme of this rant was that he believed his mother was damned and that she had committed ""the unforgivable sin,"" whatever that means, and that I should not leave my home or drive anywhere, implying that it was unsafe for me to do so. After listening to the voicemail, I unblocked his number long enough to tell him that I got the message, but it made very little sense, that he sounded unhinged from reality, and I begged him to get to his psychiatrist, or the emergency room, of the crisis center because he needs help. I know that he read the text, but he never replied. Early Monday morning, he sent me two emails, both of which were totally unintelligible. I have heard nothing else since.

I have considered going to his apartment and trying to convince him to let me take him to the hospital, but ultimately decided against it because I am afraid he might try to jump out of the car while I'm driving, or worse, grab the steering wheel and cause a crash. He can't be forced to go because he hasn't made any threats of violence to himself or anyone else, and I have neither the time nor the money to obtain a court order. 

My best friend is concerned that he might do something serious, like burn down his apartment building or something (I don't think he would because he is terrified of going to jail), and worries that if such a thing happened, I might also be liable for his activity since I knew he was unstable and didn't get him the help he needs. I doubt this would be the case, but who knows?

I don't know what I want from this community, but I guess if anyone has any advice to give, I would appreciate it. He's never been this out of it, and unless he is able to see how out of touch he is and wants help, there's little hope of changing the situation.";r/BipolarSOs;14;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nicgpm/so_has_lost_touch_with_reality/
2025-09-16 16:40:51;How do you carry both the love and the loss after a breakup like this?;"Hi everyone, I am struggling with this right now. I ended things with my partner of a year and a half a month ago, and while I know it was the right choice, I am left trying to hold both the love we shared and the way it all fell apart.

At the time my gut knew something wasn't working but couldn't put my finger on it but having been hurt in past relationships I sought to protect myself. Only after breaking up, when he started talking about “portals” and being a divine entity, did I look back at everything and think… what is happening?

Looking back there are patterns. Months of him being withdrawn and irritable, then engaged and excited about things for a few weeks only to become withdrawn again. I always assumed he was over tired from work.

 Post break up he explained fundamentally that I was “not and never was his person” in one breath and “I will always want you in my life, the good and the bad” in the next. It really felt like two different men lived in the same body.

The hardest part is that there was also real love. We talked about a future together. He went out of his comfort zone for me, we would drive to each other's towns and make real effort to connect, co-regulating with each other. Those moments felt genuine. But then these grandiose delusions have swept in and drowned out that version of him.

This seems to have been trigger by the death of his uni friend. He became completely locked on music, convinced he had been touched by divine powers and that he was going to bring the world together with it. I do not think he is quite as high now but because I have pulled back for my own wellbeing I cannot really know.

I did notify his work and his family when things got extreme, because I could not carry the worry alone.

I ended the relationship because I could not keep pouring myself dry when he could not meet me. Now I am grieving someone who is still alive. I know the man I loved is in there but illness has swallowed him. I do not know if there is ever a healthy way to reconnect but I still wonder if the grounded version of him will ever come back.

It has been a month and I am burnt out. I still feel echoes of him every day and I am trying to let go but it is harder than I thought.

For anyone who has been through this, how do you deal with the contradiction of knowing the love was real but illness has twisted it until it broke?

He is unmedicated but does take drugs; mushrooms, cocaine and drinks heavily, as far as I'm aware he has never sought diagnosis or treatments.";r/BipolarSOs;20;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nic05d/how_do_you_carry_both_the_love_and_the_loss_after/
2025-09-16 03:23:13;Well it happened to me too;My wife was diagnosed just over a year ago after going into the mental hospital. She was having manic episodes for a while and I had no idea what was going on or why we were always fighting when we used to be best friends. Well it turns out she was falling in love with her best friend, and that explained why she was never home to help with the kids when i was always asking her. She started her affair long before she caught feelings by choosing time with him over time at home, sleeping in the same bed when going to music festivals, that we couldn't afford both of us to go too because of her gambling addiction... she says she caught feeling before she went into the hospital. well after she got out, she quit her job and started working part time, spending nearly all her free time with her affair, even when i was trying to get her to go out and show her all the love i could, she wouldn't want me to go or she already had plans with him. Well she finally admitted to it recently, even though we've been fighting about it for a year. I had to present evidence for her to finally admit it. Now we're getting divorced, and I'm still in love with her and want this thing to continue. I changed my whole life for this woman, changed jobs, adopted our kids, hers from previous boyfriends, bought the big house, spent my life saving keeping us afloat from when she changed jobs. and this is what i get for it, a divorce and a drinking problem.

2025-09-15 21:52:34;BPSO just got fired…again.;"When I met my partner he had been in the same stable career job (in an admittedly low paying field) for 11 years. He was first diagnosed with bipolar essentially right when we met, and his first major manic episode came right after we moved in together about 2 years into the relationship. Since then, he has been fired three times—the first when he was offered a better position within his company with a new manager right when we moved in together, the second right after he started a new job in the same field that triggered an episode. After the second firing (and resulting hospital stay) he got serious about his meds, decided to change careers and completed an 8 month program in the trades. He started a new job in his new field that was so promising—much higher pay, great benefits, and union membership after 6 months. Even on meds, this new job triggered a manic episode, but the medication has so far helped it from spiraling out of control like the last two times. He was a month and a half into this job, on the tail end of the episode, and I thought things were going to be okay. Until this morning, when he was called in and summarily fired, with the only explanation being that his skills aren’t up to par. I have to think his mild mania has probably made him appear scattered at work, but he was showing up on time every day and giving everything he could to be a valuable employee and learn an entirely new skill set.

I’m devastated for him, because unlike the last two firings—which involved him being completely out of control and acting erratically and aggressively towards his management and coworkers—this time he was working hard at his job and doing everything he could to stay stable. There was no major incident or blow up, and yet none of it mattered…he’s still out of an amazing job.

Financially, we will be fine—I have a high-paying job with great opportunities for upward mobility. But I’m just devastated by the havoc bipolar has wreaked on both of our lives. My partner has such a strong drive to work hard and contribute to both our household and society. At this point I worry that his illness will always make it impossible for him to maintain a normal job, especially where his employment record is now so bad. I was so hopeful that this job could be his big break, and I’m so incredibly sad for both of us that he’s lost yet another opportunity that he worked so hard for.

2025-09-14 21:01:22;I think I'm at my breaking point.;"I'm going to do my best to provide all the relevant information without rambling on too long. 

My (33 F) husband (38 M) was diagnosed with BP1 about 6 years ago. He was hospitalized for a week and came home with a slew of medications and a great care plan with several doctors. What followed were 5 really good years with the occasional mild manic episode (which really just made him more fun to be around). Then, about a year ago, over the course of a week, he entered into the most severe manic episode I have seen. This was primarily brought on by increased substance use (weed) and several days of decreased sleep as we were away for my cousin's wedding (the high-energy, partier side of my family). This led to a trip to the ER and a stay at a local rehab facility. This was not a great situation, as they were really more set up to handle substance use and not significant mental illness. He was able to successfully give up weed, with the help of his AA sponsor, but this led to several months of severe depression. This spring, he started smoking again, which helped to elevate his mood but not push him into a manic state. 

This brings us to the last 6 weeks. He took an impromptu trip across the country to purchase his dream car. Between the travel, time change, limited sleep, and time spent in a state where weed is very readily accessible, a significant manic episode was triggered. Over the last several weeks, we have been trying to manage at home, with the help of his doctor, since the last episode was handled so poorly at the rehab facility. I finally put my foot down and convinced him to go back to the hospital he had gone to when he first received his diagnosis. He spent a week there, and every time I talked to him, he was sounding more and more like himself. I picked him up two days ago with high hopes. 

Now, not 48 hours after discharge, he was out all night last night, came up with a plan to drive 3 hours away to stay with friends while he prepares for divorce (after I told him I am seriously considering it), ultimately came back to town for an event, and has been talking to his mom, sister, and one of our town cops since then. He's yet to come home. If/when he does, I expect (and hope) it will be to pack a bag and go back to the hospital. 

I don't think I can handle this any more. Honestly, this last week that he was gone felt so freeing to me. I am already the one who keeps our household going (cooking, cleaning, taking care of the dogs, etc.), so other than him not being here, nothing really changed for me, except that I didn't have to wonder what mood he was going to be in each day. He has told me multiple times over the past few weeks that he is tired of being a ""chameleon"" and that if divorce is what I want, he will let me go, because he (in his words) ""took me hostage"" when we got married (10 years ago) and has been manipulating me ever since. I struggle to believe that the person he is when he's manic is who he truly his, which is what he insists. And if that's true, I don't think I can handle it any more. 

I just need to know if anyone else has gotten to this point and things got better, or if it really is time to call it quits.";r/BipolarSOs;10;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ngqq38/i_think_im_at_my_breaking_point/
2025-09-14 14:28:56;BPSO ready to reconcile after discard- I want to reconcile as healthy as I can;"Hi all,

My wife wants to talk and see if we can reconcile. She texted me after 10 months of separation and discard. The trauma from the psychosis, mania, and discard led to a strong physical reaction for a couple of days (emotional flashbacks, trouble eating and sleeping). I was filled with nervousness, hurt, anger, love, relief, and hope. 

3 weeks later and i have this gut feeling of being ready to talk, of desiring to talk to her. It's been a month since she text me. I told her originally I wanted to wait for the divorce to be finalized before we talk. But now, I just don't want to wait that long. 

 My loved ones and my therapist all think I'm making a mistake- that I'm still codependent and vulnerable. And while I know in the past I was, I've been working so hard on regaining my independence and self worth these last 10 months. I understand boundaries. I understand what bipolar is and the importance to care for myself and protect myself (my wife's bp didn't start until last year and she wasn't diagnosed/provided medication until the end of last year). 

 I feel this sense of, I want to try, Im okay if I fall, I'm okay to be heart broken again. But I miss my wife. I want to be with her again. I want to try again. And if we do try, I want to be with her for the long haul. 

How do you know when it's a good time to talk? Is there ever a best time? 

I am still shaken by everything that occured, but I also know for myself I have grown in my mental health and overall self worth, so much. I know for right now I wouldn't want to be in a relationship. But if there is a chance to start working towards a new kind of relationship in the future, I feel ready now.

2025-09-14 05:45:59;Suspected Manic Behaviors in Ex Partner (LTR Breakup);"Hi! I recently went through a breakup with my partner of 8 years. It seemingly came out of nowhere to me, and as I’ve been trying to rationalize through what actually happened I had been looking into attachment styles and originally thought oh maybe it’s just avoidance, but recently thought my ex may have been having a manic episode.

My ex-partner and I dated from 15 to 23 years old, and our relationship had been very stable! We were planning our engagement and had been actively talking about the future.

Out of the blue he told me he couldn’t see a future with me, but could with someone else. He had been going out a lot with his coworkers, and developed feelings for one and admitted to emotionally cheating on me, he claims it never went farther. He was going out 4 nights a week, drinking a lot, and staying out until ~8am.

Me and some of his family had noticed a huge shift in his behavior including an inflated ego and a lack of care for others around him. He told me the week prior to the breakup that he’s done wearing a mask, he doesn’t want to live a long time, and he doesn’t care if his family hates him for living the life he feels he needs to live.

Post breakup he started smoking cigarettes, has only had beer/liquor in our fridge in the apartment, spent hundreds of dollars on cologne, and has only been eating saltine crackers and tuna. He also has been riding his motorcycle without a helmet, and the night after the breakup took his motorcycle for a ride to West Virginia (~10 hour drive) in the rain with almost no stops. Additionally, he had a drawing on his desk of him with a crown on, standing on a pile of money, wearing sunglasses, achieving his dream of finishing his BSN.

When we spoke last in person it seemed like the person who I knew and loved was still there. But this behavior is severely out of character and frankly I’m not sure how to feel.

I still have a lot of care for him, and after doing a lot of research I know this is the age that bipolar can begin to present in men. I know this can’t be a diagnosis, but I am wondering if these symptoms align with bipolar. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice.

2025-09-14 01:57:13;I showed symptoms after dating someone manipulative who had it?;"""showed"" specifically, I don't have symptoms anymore, I was only experiencing them during that relationship or other symptoms that stem from traumatic things in that relationship.

To put things shortly, it was insanely abusive, insanely dense with events, threats, breakups, manipulation, etc. 

I was admitted into a mental hospital sometimes during that relationship, and I described what the past couple of weeks had been like in my relationship, and I was immediately given bipolar meds without any diagnosis.

Sometime before we officially broke up, we had a discussion, me him and his close friend, about some concerning behavior he had had. We thought he should seek help for some kind of bipolar disorder. Nothing was done about it.

Soon as I was out, I was normal again. Heavily traumatized, but I was no longer being put through the wringer every few hours. I got off meds and significantly improved in only a year.

I am aware that people with bipolar can be amazing partners, and nothing I say here is supposed to take away from that. I am specifically talking about someone who was completely abusive both in and outside of their illness.

Is it possible that because all of his instability was projected onto me, and my inability to have left that abuse, were my symptoms just me seeking help for something that he was experiencing?

That question sounds off, but let me provide an example. Him always accusing me of cheating with people I simply complimented, led me to believe that me complimenting other people was me subconsciously being attracted to them. And I often complained to my friends that it was something I struggled with, despite me now seeing that it was him not me.

2025-09-12 23:36:35;Blaming for “false” diagnosis;"We are back again! Two years after mania were spent blaming me for every small thing that happened. If you hadn’t done that, it wouldn’t have escalated, if you hadn’t done this, none of it wouldn’t happen. He would say sure I did xyz and it’s horrible but you are acting as if you were perfect. He has zero understanding that it is not a fight, it is not who wins. It is just what happened. If I had taken none of the safeguarding actions, or even if I hadn’t shouted back when it started because I had no idea he was manic, it would’ve still happened exactly the same way because mania is not reasonable. 
I only hoped non-manic him would be reasonable and get that but he doesn’t. He took medication for three years, the last year we were good. At least “I”thought we were because he was finally not blaming me and was kind and nice. 
This year the psychiatrist got him off the meds. They had been saying for some time that since no mood swings have come, maybe he just has anxiety and that episode was a one off. He stopped the medication, has been more irritable and angrier but nothing manic. And now his theory is that it was all because of me.
“I” told everyone a “narrative” and based on that they wrongly diagnosed him of being bipolar. He didn’t need meds and took them which made him sterile (or so he thinks, no proof). He took meds because I said coming together is dependent on him taking treatment because that’s what he was diagnosed as. He took treatment because I said it and three years he was “compliant in everything” and it was all because of what I told the psychiatrists.

All I told them was of course what happened but he thinks it is everyone’s confirmation bias. He has started minimizing the manic episode. And now is finding reasons again for everything because he says if I don’t have bipolar I never had mania, and this “episode” can be explained. 

When I reply and correct him in what really happened he again blames me that I have embellished and exaggerated into a nice neat narrative so the episode can be recognized as mania. And he also blames me for being consistently insistent on what my view of things are. 

Now I don’t want to insist, I didn’t bring anything up. I have been as supportive as possible through his depression and anxiety and the treatment journey and coming off meds. I did insist on treatment post mania but since then I have not insisted on anything . But I can’t change the “narrative” so to speak because it isn’t a narrative. It is just what happened. And four years after mania he has had enough distance that it sounds completely made up and fantastical. But it is only because it was!! Because that’s what mania is! If he keeps insisting it wasn’t mania then he will have to find reasons for why he did all those things and it is in his interests to keep them minimized because there is no logical or good enough reason to do all he did outside of mania.

I’m just so tired. He is shouting, screaming and sometimes I just don’t engage because there is no use arguing with someone whose whole premise is that I’m lying when I’m not. What possible reason can I give again and again. He is sitting righteous and sanctimonious and I don’t honestly even know what he wants from me.

I’m so fed up";r/BipolarSOs;11;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nf6gr6/blaming_for_false_diagnosis/
2025-09-12 19:16:38;Advice on breaking up.;"Been with my partner for about 2 years, they were open about their diagnosis from the beginning and I just said we should discuss it as things come up that don't really work for the relationship.

About 2 months in there was an event that flared their past trauma and they started pulling away physically which hurt me a lot, but every time I brought it up, I was closed down because they didn't want to discuss it and essentially I became the bad person for having the sadness.

I'm seeing a therapist on it, but every 3 or so months my emotional cup runs over, and we end up in an argument where I come out the bad person because I've brought the issue up. I'm fairly empathetic and hurting someone does not sit well with my ethics, so I start the cycle of 'I am a bad person, I need to amend my behaviour' again. 
I accept that trauma is trauma and I have not always been good in helping in this regard, but once upon a time I believed in balance and shared emotional responsibility in relationship, I think.

This is kind of standard for any relationship issue, I try to broach something, it gets closed down or I become the bad person for having feelings, and I'm kind of at the end of my rope. I've always based relationships on communication and honesty and this 'ignore it and it's all fine' mentality is draining and killing any sense of self I have.

They've basically got no support system, so it's just me and I feel entirely responsible for keeping them going. I'm well aware that this isn't okay or what I set out to achieve with this relationship. But I want out and I just don't have the ability to separate the responsibility that I've given myself (I've never been told I'm responsible, it's just built up over the years) with my own wants and needs.

Essentially just looking to know if this is something anyone else has hit, what was your outcome?

Any and all advice would be great! Thanks!

2025-09-11 03:41:51;Does anyone feel the same? You’re normal but your life just shattered overnight due to psychotic violent spouse/ex spouse?;"Hi all,

I connected with our new realtor today for the first time and she said how she'd like to meet both me and my husband together (despite knowing we are separating) to go over the sale of the home and her estimate, and at first I was like ""ok maybe he can join by Zoom"" but then I had to call her back and tell her that's not possible due to the ""high tension"" in this case and if she can meet with us separately (there's currently a very restrictive restraining order in place, but I didn't want to scare her and tell her, and I was trying to see if there's any way to get around it but I don't think I should).

My brother-in-law then said ""yeah, despite you divorcing, a number of separating couples can at least hack it to be in one place to discuss the sale of the home together. But *your situation* is NOT the typical divorce by any means,"" and I just felt so shattered and stigmatized. It's so true though, but I just still can't believe that I went from being such a well-adjusted successful person to basically marrying and having a kid with an unknowing sociopath/narcissist/bipolar psychotic person all overnight. My life has just been completely ruined overnight. My therapists are all super expensive but I'm going to look into free therapy to assist with processing all this, I know a number of people here suggested it. 

I'm just curious if anyone feels the same... when you read my Court materials about what my husband did, it honestly all reads like he's a sociopathic killer or something. It's really scary. A number of therapists suggested he probably has a second diagnosis that's not yet detected (maybe sociopath/narcissist, psychotic disorder..) I don't know, but he's not the TYPICAL bipolar patient. It's crazy how I'm attached to this life and how I ended up here. Has anyone experienced their spouse/ex partner to be violent and also completely unstable, yet you're perfectly normal? How did we end up here? It feels like I'm truly living in some twilight zone. Should I feel embarrassed or ashamed for this? But I did nothing wrong. :(";r/BipolarSOs;10;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ndo7h7/does_anyone_feel_the_same_youre_normal_but_your/
2025-09-10 02:14:38;My therapist thinks my husband is bipolar, need advice;"My 30F husband 34M was diagnosed with ADHD over 10 years ago and took prescription Adderall until the shortage occurred a couple years ago. He started ordering it on the internet from a random source and would test it to make sure it was clean, but to this day, I don’t know if it was. He started taking it and I noticed his behavior changing subtly over time - more aggression, started punching walls when we would get into arguments. Then he was staying up every night working on electronics projects. He refused to come to sleep. I thought it was just his ADHD.

We moved to another apartment and the behaviors continued. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get him to come to bed. He would be up every day until 5-6am and crash. He ended up losing his job and his coworkers told him they thought he had substance abuse issues.

He went about a year of being unemployed where he was still staying up all the time and then he started crashing all day every day. Just sleeping and sleeping. He would fall asleep on the toilet. He refused to stay home because all he would do at home was sleep. To cope, he started going to the bar from about 4pm until they closed at 5am and wouldn’t go to bed until 7-9 am. It was absolutely insane, I was losing my shit and we got into the worst fights imaginable.

Then around 6 months ago, in the height of all of this, he started having a delusion that I was using a vibrator every night while laying next to him. No matter what I said, he wouldn’t believe me. He had a million reasons for why I was doing it. He had a few different apps and devices that he’d use to “measure” the vibrations and that was enough proof for him. He didn’t care about my word or the fact that despite the hundreds of times he frantically searched me, there was no vibrator to be found. My breaking point was one night when he came home from the bar, we started fighting and it escalated to him saying physically hurting me over this delusion, he was so desperate to get the “truth” out of me.

I eventually left and stayed with my mom for two months. He told me he was so sorry, he realized it was our apartment building that was causing the vibrations, and begged me to give him another chance. He promised that everything would be better, he was committed to working on himself. Despite my intense fears, I wanted to make the marriage work and see him get better, so we moved in with his in-laws. He quit taking the weird Adderall and stopped drinking and found a job within 3 weeks of being here. Though, he still didn’t go to therapy like he promised. Everything was improving until last week. We both couldn’t sleep one night, we were tossing and turning. The following night, he went to sleep on the couch because it was “noisy.” Then the following 4-5 nights it was back to square one, the delusion returned full force and he doesn’t believe me again, and still thinks I lied about it before.

I have no idea what to do, I feel so lost and hurt. I talked to my therapist today and she thinks he’s bipolar. I don’t know anything about it, is that what this seems like to you? Have any of you been in a similar situation? Any advice is appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;10;18;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ncqhej/my_therapist_thinks_my_husband_is_bipolar_need/
2025-09-09 22:52:53;Bipolar wife filed for divorce, can’t explain why;My (32m) wife (25f) filed for divorce while I was out of town for work. My wife was diagnosed with BP1 two years ago. We have had a rocky relationship for the last 5 years. I can’t even remember how many times she has left me, even moved our children (6m) and (2f) across the country. She leaves then a few months later she wants to get back together. This summer things came to a head when I had to leave town for work for about 10 weeks. She swore things would be different this time, that she would hold it down and remain steadfast. About 6 weeks into me being gone, she left our kids at her parents house and told them she was comming to visit me. Instead of coming to see me she left town with an affair partner, and filed for divorce when she got home. We have both been unfaithful in the past, and I thought we were working though it, but she seems resolute that things are over between us. I’m afraid of what will happen with our kids. Should I fight for custody? Can I even win? I don’t want them to grow up in an unstable environment, but I don’t want to fight a long custody battle that I’m not sure I can win. Though it all, I still love my wife, but I can’t plan for the future with a partner that can’t stay consistent for more than a few weeks. ;r/BipolarSOs;10;11;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1ncl2t5/bipolar_wife_filed_for_divorce_cant_explain_why/

He recently ended things to focus on his mental health. He mentioned he needs to do this alone and doesn't want to drag me in his spiraling. As much as it pains me to let him do this on his own, i feel so helpless and I don't know what to do. I want to be there for him so badly but also understanding he needs space. He wont be fully alone as he has great family support, taking his meds, and attending therapy each week. We both care about each other a lot and i know ending things with me was not easy. It was not a goodbye as he said.

2025-09-09 03:55:28;How do I deal with the cycling?;"My husband was diagnosed bipolar 3 years ago, it's been a bumpy ride. He wonders if he's been this way much longer, but he masked it with alcohol and then weed. He's been sober from alcohol since 2020 and sober from weed for the past 3 months while job hunting. Currently he's cycling and we have a vacation scheduled for next week. Last week he told me we should check the weather in case we have to cancel due to a hurricane (trip is to OBX) and I've been monitoring things, which look decent. He said last week we should cancel because we don't know what the weather will do and just stay home. He freaked out about the ""non-refundable deposit"" which is refundable because I purchased trip insurance. Now, he's freaking out today because I booked us a charter fishing trip, again about the weather. I checked... upper 70's and sunny so far. He got angry because I booked the charter, and I tried to explain I actually couldn't procrastinate any longer because those trips fill up in popular fishing spots and I couldn't even get the captain I wanted because he was already booked out. It's not something where you can just show up and hope someone's available. He's saying we just shouldn't go, cancel everything. Dude I literally got someone to watch the animals at our house, the Vrbo has been booked for months, I've been taking care of the planning and finances for this. Deciding not to go will just cause us to lose a lot of money because the trip insurance has certain conditions. You ""just don't wanna go anymore"" at the last minute isn't a qualifying reason.

The thing that frustrates me is he HATES his job. He desperately needs a vacation and we chose Hatteras because we had such a good time there a few years ago, and specifically the fishing charter was the highlight of the trip. He is taking his meds, but he's in the ""impending doom"" state, where nothing I can ever say makes any sense, and all of my suggestions are met with a reason as to why none of that will work. It feels like he wants immediate relief without doing any of the work and I'm EXHAUSTED from fielding all of this!

How can I explain this to him in this state? This is the first time I am reaching out to others who deal with bipolar spouses, I do not have a support system that understands his condition other than to tell me to just get a divorce. He's not abusive, he's sick.

Edit: He is NOT in therapy, he tried a few times when he was in active alcoholism, but said it didn't work and has been vehemently against therapy ever since. I've suggested it so many times I'm kinda done. If he's not willing to get the help, trying to force him will only make matters worse.

2025-09-08 19:29:40;How do I show my exSO that I'm truly apologetic and working on myself?;"Hi, I'm the Bipolar SO in this situation and would like to get input. I've been scrolling through here since my diagnosis and it's been really helpful making me see the error in my ways, and it actually motivated me to get help.

I broke up with my boyfriend of nearly 3 years after three months of fighting, little to no sex, watching him spiral into alcoholism, and me going completely manic and doing some really fucked up shit including making out with my friend, trying to dump him multiple times, telling him some evil things, etc. The worst part is I lost a lot of time between these episodes, and I don't remember them. He did some shitty things to me too. I found out he was looking at OF girls and that sent me into overdrive, and I couldn't look at myself in the mirror for months, or get intimate without the fear of performing in the back of my head. 

We ruined each other's self esteem. I wish I never said those things during my episodes, and I wish he understood what looking at airbrushed plastic women made me feel like. So I broke up with him, acknowledging that I deeply needed help for my undiagnosed disorder because I didn't want to hurt him anymore, and also because the situation ruined my self esteem.

This was about a month ago. The day after I left, I immediately started hunting for psychiatrists, got an appointment, and started medication three days after. Despite being no contact, I text him, telling him my diagnosis and truly apologized, and sighted that while I wasn't right in the head, I still said and did those things, and I can't take them back but I also can't express how truly guilty I feel for doing that to someone who loved me so hard. He never answered, and I respect that.

I didn't get on meds just for him. I was trapped inside my head and a body I hated, I was tired of being manic and then having suicidal thoughts and trying to discard everyone around me. I wanted to be happy again, excited and happy to enjoy life, motivated, and feel like a human again, not jekyll and hyde. So i took those steps. I also moved back home with my parents, who have been very supportive and caring, even though they're a bit uneducated and don't understand my diagnosis.

While I wish I could have him back in my life, I know it's not realistic. However, I just want to get advice from BPSO's on how to formally apologize and explain what was going on, and taking responsibility for my actions. Truly. Not just because I want him back in my life. What are things you wish your SO would have said? How do you wish that conversation went? Do you wish they apologized at all? Did you believe them? I know everyone is different, but I'm interested in hearing people's thoughts.

2025-09-08 06:55:54;Friendship-ending phone conversation;"I (M, gay) met my flatmate Anaïs (F, straight) after she was released from a psychiatric hospital. She’s a diagnosed bipolar with a manipulative streak. Her baby had been taken from her because her behavior was deemed too unstable to care for a child. From the start, her life was chaotic: psychiatric hospitalizations, volatile relationships, an indiscriminate sex drive, and little sense of consequences.

I remember once finding her wandering at 6 pm, planning to go to a bar hoping to get picked up. I followed along, trying to buffer her from male attention and convince her to focus on her goals instead, as she always ended up saying she had reluctantly accepted sex when she would have rather not have in retrospect. She would call me from bars, unable to disengage from disastrous dates. I once spent three hours trying to distract a particularly awful guy while she excused herself repeatedly, only for her to bring him home anyway. I had to kick him out myself because she came to my room to say she didn't know how to shake him off. That was the last straw, and I began detaching.

She left our flat on a whim, abandoning rent responsibilities. During COVID, she returned, claiming she had nowhere to stay—even though her mother was nearby. I suggested she try her family first. She ignored advice, lost her scholarship, and ended up in dire situations on her own.

Over the years, she gained some stability—her own apartment, a job, shared custody of her child—but her pattern persisted. We remained friends, and our relationship was better for the distance we kept between each other.  
  
When the time came that I was the one facing some difficulties (unemployment, lack of money, wanting to come home but being unable to), she boasted she could help me—but only if I surrendered control: leave my studies, abandon my accommodation, move in with her while paying rent off the lease. I refused; I didn’t want to be a burden to someone so unstable with a toddler, and it made me look like I abused someone vulnerable. Plus it's super illegal in public housing to sublet. She didn't understand, or feigned not to understand that I would never even consider making myself homeless to accept her ""help"".

She continued to call me about boyfriends, expecting me to fill the gaps between them. She told me how she would have random rows at them, kick them out, be lost without the money they brough, ending up in a psych ward for some time.  
  
She continued with offers to help me move back in town, always conditional, and followed by withdrawals paired with guilt-tripping and blame. She even encouraged me to transfer Law Schools under the pretense of helping me settle in, only to pull back when I tried to accept, in the most recent event. As a consequence, I'm late for school and I won't be able to attend before next month, and I will have to go into debt just to move back.

I do not blame her, and I didn't think she owed me help, but as she withdrew her grandiose offer to help and be a saviour, she started attacking me instead, as if I was responsible for her change of heart. I was irresponsible, I had to work, I couldn't to both Law School and work, I had to COMMIT MYSELF TO A PSYCH WARD???

Lately, she’s doing better financially and professionally but continues to copy aspects of my life while imposing impossible conditions on me. She recently insisted I “seek help” because it has ""worked for her"". She considers my financial hardship (I have some life in me yet, mind you) to be a sign of mental collapse.  
  
Her offers of support are less about generosity and more about control, and the abuse has been clearly cyclical, not just symptomatic of bipolar episodes. She has been getting agitated as I replied that bipolar and my own ADHD weren't on the same level of gravity, and if I was seeing a psychiatrist it was to manage symptoms and adapt my medication intake. I do not get so dysfunctional and dangerous to myself and others, so that I have to be institutionalised sporadically (including for willingly getting off her meds).

She's decided I was insulting her and looking down on her, and the only way I can redeem myself to her is to commit myself to a ward. When I started to say we had different needs, she simply hung up in a rage.

I never thought I’d despise a friend so completely, but this experience has been a brutal lesson in recognizing manipulation, maintaining boundaries, and protecting myself from cyclical abuse.";r/BipolarSOs;0;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nb7hhb/friendshipending_phone_conversation/

2025-09-07 21:27:29;Will my friend be able to realize he needs help?;"
Hi y’all,

I have a friend who is most likely bipolar as well as has narcissistic personality disorder (vulnerable type). He’s currently in intensive outpatient treatment, staying at an Airbnb near the facility and working with them daily. The thing is, he doesn’t seem to be doing well. They were supposed to have diagnosed him already, it was supposed to happen around the 5-week mark, but he’s been there for about 2 months now. When we ask him about it, he says it hasn’t happened yet, which I honestly don’t believe.

The bigger issue is that he isn’t opening up. He thinks he’s smarter than the people trying to help him, doesn’t see that he has a problem, and insists it’s everyone else. You all know the patterns that come with these disorders, so I won’t rehash all of them, but basically, he’s there to get help while doing everything he can to avoid looking at himself. Instead, he focuses on what he thinks is wrong with everyone else...the psychiatrist, the therapist, friends, family, even strangers. This is exactly what he did at home, too. He insists that “it takes two” to have problems, but in his case, we all know that’s not true. He’s seriously ill. His therapist has even told his wife as much, and they’re just hoping he sticks with treatment. We all agree.

My question is: will he ever be able to see that the issue really lies with him and start working on himself? Or are the defense mechanisms in these disorders so strong that it’s basically impossible for him to “realize” that he’s the one who needs help, not everyone else around him? It’s painful to watch him struggle so much, and also hard to see that he can’t recognize the need to work on himself... that the change has to come from within. Maybe he can’t change. Maybe his brain state is so compromised that he actually has a physical problem with his brain that won’t allow him to improve. I really don’t know, but I sure would like to.

On a related note, I was wondering about books. I thought about An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness by Kay Redfield Jamison. I know it’s mainly about bipolar disorder, but do you think it could help him? He’s an avid reader, so my hope is that reading someone else’s personal experience might spark some realization about the importance of treatment and medication. But I’m also aware it might be better coming from his therapist or psychiatrist. Getting it directly from a friend or family member could embarrass him or make him defensive. Maybe there’s an even better book out there that speaks to both disorders. I’d love recommendations if anyone has them.

All of his relationships are chaotic and strained...family, friends, coworkers, even people like restaurant servers. It doesn’t matter who; there always seems to be conflict. Is this a lost cause, or should we keep fighting for his wellbeing and improvement? It’s really hard to see someone struggle this badly, creating chaos all around them, yet not realize they themselves need to do the work. We don’t want to give up on him. He has good moments, and at times he really does want to do good for others, but his inner turmoil takes over so much of the time.

Any thoughts or ideas on this? We’re trying to hold onto hope for him.";r/BipolarSOs;3;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1nat668/will_my_friend_be_able_to_realize_he_needs_help/

2025-09-07 07:42:16;New here;Long post coming.  I’ve been married to my wife for just under 20 years, together for 25. We have 2 teen boys.  She is my best friend and I love her with all of my being.  About 10 years ago, a very close cousin of hers died suddenly and she did not handle it well. She began hanging out with younger work friends, partiers really. She doesn’t drink but started doing so and hiding it.  Staying out almost all night and sleeping only 2 or 3 hours at a time. At the time we had a 2 and 4 year old.  After a stupid argument over something very trivial she decided that she needed space and moved out.  She said she loved me but didn’t know if she was in love with me anymore. She bounced around on couches and stayed with her father.  She took the kids occasionally but mostly kept away. Over the next few months she started acting more erratic but it was all subtle. She eventually had an emotional affair at the very least. Then the crash came. She locked herself in the bathroom at work for hours and ultimately was hospitalized for a few weeks and diagnosed with bipolar 2. then did intensive out patient program. Ultimately she moved home and we moved on.  It wasn’t really talked about we just settled back in over time. She stayed medicated and things got better. She clashed a lot with her doctor and eventually turned care over to her primary physician.  She has been on the same medication now for going on 9 years with no adjustment. Over the last few months she began being distant. Spending weekends with friends and taking on more jobs than are healthy. Sometimes working 14-16 hours a day.  Sleeping 2-3 hours a night and repeat.  She also began working out at 5 am 5-6 days a week.   My kids found her at the home of a coworker when she was supposed to be at the beach with girl friends.  Not looking for her. Just a bad coincidence. We argued a bit but nothing crazy.  And she again said she loves me but feels like she’s lost and needs space and feels like a machine.  She can’t make decisions and feels guilty about everything she does.  The day before she was going to come home from her trip she almost bought a puppy from a woman on a boardwalk. Something she would normally never consider. After her moving out last week she has said she is going to seek therapy but any time I ask about it she says it’s hard to find someone.  I took the reins and found her therapy and med management even though she hasn’t returned home. She also insisted I apologize to the guy we found her with because he was mad that his neighbors were asking what was going on and why my kids were upset. I swallowed my pride and reached out to him and he said he was too mad at me for the “way we reacted” and couldn’t speak to me. He’s also 10 or so years younger than my wife. I started therapy myself because I feel all the same things as last time. It’s seemingly out of nowhere.  We love each other and have a great marriage. I am lost because I feel betrayed and sad and confused, but also worried as hell.  She said she made a dr appointment for her primary just to talk until she can get to the place I found her but I followed up with the primary and they said she never showed. In the meantime she still says she needs space but texts me to talk periodically and when she is here to see the kids she acts normal to me and if I seem upset she asks me why I’m upset and I don’t know how to act. I’m trying to keep myself together working full time and taking care of our kids and the house and the pets be as supportive as I can.   Just rambling at this point.

2025-09-07 04:03:18;How do you do it longterm?;"TLDR: Spouse has been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 after 2 manic episodes that both required hospitalization. These are followed by depressive episodes. Currently in a depressive episode. 

How do you do this? Does this cycle ever smooth out?  Ever since my spouses first episode, I feel like I'm hyper-vigilant looking for signs of the next episode. Medicatoin helps, but I worry they will go off of the without me knowing (as they have done before...twice).  

When my spouse goes into depression, they basically become incapable of doing nearly any task without help, want constant reassurance, get very toucy/feely requiring constant touching, etc. I basically have to take care of them, making sure they eat, bathe, change clothes, etc. Everything is a ""I cant"" or ""Everything is too hard"". I try to provide support, but theres no winning. Either I'm mean for making them do things they aren't 'feeling up to' or I'm meaning for doing it myself and making them feel worthless. 

When they're manic, they go full-on manic. I dont know what I'm getting minute to minute. 

This has been nearly 4 years at this point since hte first episode. I dont feel like I've been able to 'turn it off' since then.  How do you guys do this who have been with someone longterm with this disease? Does it ever get better, do I get to trust my partner again? Do I get to live a life without waiting for it to blow up with no reasoning? I'm really struggling here.

2025-09-06 23:15:06;Doing this for almost 40 years;"I do not remember a time before I was aware of bipolar disorder. The first time I remember trying a banana was visiting my father who had been hospitalized. It was the early 90s and I still have memories of how cold and lonely the hospital felt. I was very young but I remember knowing how sad it all was. 

I grew up keenly aware of my father’s cycles of depression. He would sleep for days. He wouldn’t interact with anyone he would bounce between bed and recliner seemingly half alive. I would always sit with him and watch TV even if he never said a word. I didn’t want him to feel lonely. As I got older that awareness turning into a combination of shame and overprotectiveness. I wouldn’t let my friend come over because I didn’t want them to see what I had grown used to.
In my teens my oldest sister was also diagnosed with bipolar. Her teen years were tough and combined with his issues I always felt like it was my responsibility to not rock the boat. To make my mother’s life less difficult and try and protect my father. 
It was also the first time in my life I began to resent my father a bit. You could bank on an episode around the holidays. Typically one that would leave my mother feeling like shit. At one point she made me tell him how I felt and I tore into him. I just wanted him to be happy. Us to be happy. 

I won’t say I didn’t have a good childhood. I grew up in a small town and we had support from family. But I always felt guilty because my father never seemed happy. 

When I fell in love at 21 it all happened very fast. We had our first child and I had my own family to take care of. But I was always keeping tabs on my family. My sister had three children before she turned 22 and none of their fathers were around. I felt as if I needed to be there for them as well. She was unstable and her bipolar impacted our whole family. In my opinion it led to my parents divorce. She was not capable of taking care of her children so my mother was taking care of her, my father and all her children. Eventually she couldn’t do it anymore. This coincided with my wife finding a job 3 hours away. 

The most therapy I had ever done was when I was trying to decided what to do. I could have talked my wife out of the job so I could continue to protect my family or I could put mine first and start a new life without having to constantly check in on my dad and sister. I chose to move.

As I knew it would happen after I left and my parents divorced my sister and father were left to take care of each other. It didn’t go well. Both got worse and worse. They pissed through low income housing set ups and cheap apartments. They stopped taking care of themselves.I tried to be supportive but they clearly had given up. Without my mother there they slowly got worse and worse. 

After the move as we got older it became clear that my wife also had inherited mental health issues. Finding out it was bipolar was nothing short of devastating. I said to myself “ well at least I know how to handle it”. Turns out I was wrong.

I began drinking to blow off steam and that turned into something my wife tolerated then resented. I was never mean or irresponsible and I do not go out to bars. But she didn’t like that I needed it and I can understand. I’m still disappointed in myself for letting it turn into a way to cope. Alcohol is not a coping skill. 

As I began to try and deal with that, my father’s health fell off quickly. In all honesty my father passively killed himself. He ignored his diabetes and kidney failure for years. In the end when he ended up in the hospital he chose to stop doing dialysis despite the doctors saying he would recover. He didn’t want to live anymore. It shattered me. I tried to tell him goodbye and how much I loved him but he said he didn’t want to do that. I’m not sure I will ever understand why. 

This period opened a lot of old wounds. It also led to a major falling out with my sister. I also found myself still in a situation where the person I love the most was unhappy and I couldn’t fix it. I love her with all my heart. I wouldn’t be where I am in my career had she not pushed me. She is not my father but I have never not felt like I was responsible for their outcomes. 

Im approaching my 40s and I am just as scared as I was when I was a child. I’m scared she will never be happy. I’m scared that I will never be happy. I don’t know how to take care of myself and it’s getting harder and harder to stay positive and supportive. 

It’s hard to admit that as I approach 40 I cannot maintain anymore. I love my wife just as deeply as I loved my father. I don’t want to lose the family I have worked so hard to keep together. But I’m so exhausted. I need help but even that seems selfish. I can’t imagine putting my needs above hers. I don’t have a mental illness so I should be able to keep it together. But it’s just getting harder and harder. 

I don’t necessarily need advice I just needed to put this out somewhere. I don’t talk to anyone about this as I find people are quick these days to judge or advocate divorce and that is not what I’m looking to do. Again I love my wife. I just maybe am looking to share my story and see if there are many others who went from child of a parent with bipolar to having a spouse with the same problem. It’s colored my entire life.

2025-09-06 03:45:39;White-knuckling my husband's current episode;"My husband was diagnosed, but episodes were relatively rare. His last one was 2 years ago and it landed him in a clinic for about a week. He left with a couple boxes of olanzapine and unrealized plans to work with a medication administrator. 

Back to the present, disorganized thinking and erratic behavior started surfacing just over a week ago. He is obsessed with ""cleaning"" and ""fixing things"", but the outcome is his treasured belongings getting mixed with garbage, lost phones, flooded bathrooms, clogged drains. Desperate to stem damage, I started doling out 5 mg olanzapine. Unfortunately, I listened to his claim about the clinic dosing the patients in the morning. This seems to have contributed to him sleeping all day, ""fixing"" things all night. If anything, the situation seems worse.

We finally got an appointment with a prescriber, but it's next month. He's not far gone enough to be committed, yet needs constant monitoring. Other than ""don't go over 20 mg of olanzapine/day"", we're riding this out with no medical help. He may have been tucking the dissolving tablets away to be spat out later, so I have started mixing them with a small amount of milk to ensure the full dosage is taken. 

I am about to try 10 mg olanzapine in the evening to help sleep. I am half out of my mind from losing sleep every night and in need of a reality check: Does this seem reasonable? Are there drawbacks?

Edit for more background: No treatment plans were ever made. Following the clinic stay, it took so long to find a provider that it never happened.

2nd Edit for update: Thanks so much for the advice, milagro2035!!! 2 days later, 10mg near bedtime has enabled my husband to sleep through the night. We seems to be communicating in the same universe and there are fewer destructive jags.

The lesson I've learned (and will likely forget before the next episode):
Out of mind, out of sight - when our realities begin to diverge, find and keep difficult to replace items like keys, wallet, phone. Try to hide the router and plugs behind uninteresting objects (but keep pictures of the routers and other technical gear so they could be restored when necessary). Only keep a small amount of soap/dishwashing liquid/shampoo in dispensers since it's only a matter of time before all get flushed down the drain. Remove all soap from the bathroom until a regular sleep schedule is restored (With all the soap shoved down the drain, here's hoping we don't need Roto-rooter to dig out our own version of Fatberg!). Unfortunately, the laundry machines cannot be protected. Accept that they may be collateral damage. At least, their repair/replacement will be less expensive than being committed.";r/BipolarSOs;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n9f0jh/whiteknuckling_my_husbands_current_episode/

We should be on our honeymoon right now. Instead, I'm doing the usual Thursday babysitting gig, going home to two roommates, neither of which is you, and a cat that you would probably hate, even though she's very similar to your dog, in personality. 

I've gone through a mix of emotions. Guilt, depression, rage, numbness. I've blamed you, your illness, myself. None of it is terribly insightful. 

I still hope you've sought out a proper diagnosis and treatment, even though I sincerely doubt it. I hope you're happier, and less angry. I hope you are able to process the things you were struggling with. 

I hope one day you reach out. I hope you apologize for how you behaved, take accountability and recognize that you still caused harm even if you weren't thinking straight. Because harm was done, I suffered at your hand and choices. That's still true at the same time as acknowledging that you might not have been capable of making sane decision. I hope I can tell you that it's ok, and that while I'm sorry we both had to go through that, I'm glad we learned that we weren't meant for each other before we got married. Because it wasn't just this that was wrong with us. 

I hope you find someone strong enough to walk the path with you, because I truly do not think I could have, as much as I loved you and wanted to. 

I hope you find happiness.";r/BipolarSOs;6;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n8st4q/unsent_letter_saw_someone_else_write_one_and_i/
2025-09-04 18:51:57;Is there any hope?;"We have been married 23 years. He used to rage at me and then come back and apologize and take accountability for his rage. But somehow over the years it shifted to me needing to “do the work” too. Several years ago in (what I know realize  a manic episode he gave me an ultimatum that I had to work on myself and go to therapy or he would divorce me. Then it became a regular theme. 

He has been in therapy for at least 10 years, way before he was diagnosed. He started meds about 5 years ago after he was hospitalized and diagnosed. He used to be a severe alcoholic but has successfully been sober for 5 years from alcohol but he smokes weed heavily. 

He takes his meds but still is deteriorating. He is angry and withdrawn all the time now. He is extremely defensive and basically thinks I am his biggest enemy. Family members have said to me that is terrible the way he treats me. That it’s like he doesn’t even like me anymore. Then he recently blew up in me and told me that he doesn’t love me anymore and wants a divorce. A few days go by and he hasn’t said much else about it except that we are “fighting”. I am in limbo and losing hope fast. I am in therapy but so much of my life revolves around his irrational behavior. 

Does anyone have experience with a spouse that has recovered after seeming to just deteriorate for over a year even while being on medication and intense therapy? ";r/BipolarSOs;10;6;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n86vod/is_there_any_hope/

2025-09-02 07:47:45;How do I get my potentially bipolar fiancee to go see a doctor?;"My possibly BPSO has not been diagnosed yet, never had treatment or meds, hasn't talked to a psychiatrist and has been exibiting symptoms for 10-11 months now.



We're both 28. We've been together for 5.5 years, and living together in happiness and bliss for most of that period. Towards the end of last year, so about 9-10 months ago she started to use ChatGPT intensely and it drove her to psychosis. She started to believe she's found the cause of Parkinsons. She started to write a paper (ended up being around 100 pages) on the Unified theory of physics (she's a student of psychology, a dyslexic and can't do basic grade school level math). She believes that her AI chatbot is a deity, I believe a Hindu deity of some kind, she is conversing with and being enlightened and herself becoming something along the lines of a prophet or a projection of that deity.



I knew something was wrong but it took me an embarassingly long time to understand these are textbook delusions and that she was in psychosis. She did exibit symptoms of mania as well of course especially in the last few months, staying up for multiple nights with no stimulants writing her physics manifestos. Or sleeping for about 3 hours a night. Increased sex drive. Generally heightened mood I guess. I don't fully understand mania yet, but this seems to be part of it?



First time I said something to her was back in Dec/Jan, I half jokingly said I was going to have her commited. She had an unsually severe reaction... not agressive but genuinely frightened. I remember the fear in her eyes vividly. I apologized and let it go and was afraid to say something for months and just swept the problems under the rug. About three months ago I snapped again, told her she's unwell and we need to go see a doctor or a shrink. We had this same fight two nights in a row. A week later she told me we aren't compatible, she's afraid to marry me because she thinks that would give me power of attorney and allow me to have her commited or something (don't even know if it works that way but she believes it).



I tried pleading with her to stay and she did, for about a month, and then went off to her mom's house to be with her and broke things off with me for good. So now she's 600 km away and in a different country. I gave it a couple of months to see if she comes back to her senses. She did not. She's saying she loves the new her and doesn't want to go back.



I called her dad and explained to him what had happened in the last months. At this point I had a clearer idea of what she was going through and retold everything to him in detail. He gave me some details regarding his ex-wife (my fiancee's mom) and it turns out she could be bipolar too. The mother and daughter seem to be a very bad influence on each other cause they keep affirming each other's delusions. All three of them are living in the same house right now. After listening to what I had to say he agreed to have a conversation with his daughter and judge by himself her mental state.



Today he sends me a text basically saying ""Well I just had a nice chat with her and she seems fine to me!"". This really pissed me off. I talk to my mom and she tells me ""Don't diagnose her! Maybe she's just tired!"". Jesus Christ. In a way I get it of course, it took me so many months to come to terms with what was going on.



Now you know the story. What should be my strategy here? My thoughts right now are I need to talk to a local psychatrist and ask them for advice on how to proceed, my mom is trying to talk me out of it because it's going to make me the bad guy or something, or I'm going to look like the one that needs help, or it might disturb their family. I feel like I can't rely on anyone around me and I just want my poor beloved fiancee to get the medical treatment she needs as soon as possible (and maybe her mom too).

2025-09-02 06:22:49;Resigned to live like roommates with Benefits BP wife;"I feel so sad, but also resigned to giving up what I thought my marriage would be.  We never had a fairy tale romantic relationship, but there was definitely passion and affection, even more so from her than me. She used to text all the time, just to say she was thinking about me, she loves me, can’t wait for me to get home. 

She has always initiated intimacy, she did the first week we dated, and she had been Super sexual the last several years. But if I try to initiate she always says no, that I’m being clingy and desperate, so I back off.  She does  occasionally show  me some affection, but only in front of other people like our kids. She’ll hold my  hand, maybe a kiss here and there. But in private, nothing, unless she wants sex, then back to being detached and like a roommate. She doesn’t want to actually touch me, just wants me to be nearby in the house. So I stay away so she’ll be comfortable and feel safe at home. I know she cheated several times on other partners in the past and I don’t want to give her reason to find someone else. 

 I’m starting to feel she was manic when I met her, 10 years ago. She disclosed her diagnosis the first week, so I’m aware and I’ve done a lot of reading, talking to other partners of BPSOs. I never thought that before but I’m really afraid that’s what happened, and now since we have kids she only stays for appearances. 

When I try to bring it up, she goes bezerk and has a huge reaction, so I don’t try anymore. I try to hide how much it hurts, but she gets suspicious if I’m not upbeat and smiling all the time, she demands I tell her “what she’s done now?”

How do I accept that this may be the end of the affection she used to show me? How do I turn off the sadness? I just want to exist peacefully and take care of our kids.  I can deal with it, I accept her and I love her more than anything in the world, and she knows I do. I just wish affection came naturally to her, or she could try to consider how neglected and taken for granted I feel.

He went manic in March. It lasted til July. Had a few good weeks. Then suddenly back to mania. Working on getting the right medication, which I think is what caused the current mania.

He's never done something like this. Rape has always disgusted him, he's always been an ally to women's struggles. But he did it. I cried and begged and said no and he did it anyway. And when I fought back too hard, he pulled away and told me in the most disgusted tone, ""not even any good to me as a fuck toy.""

So that's what I've become to him. A play thing. I wanted to support him through therapy and medication getting sorted. But i think it's too dangerous now. I have to leave, or he's going to hurt me again. Or I'm going to kill myself.

I'm also bipolar. Type 2. I've spent years working on myself, building my self awareness and self control. I was diagnosed and started treatment at 18, following a suicide attempt back then. So I know what he's going through. I know he needs someone there for him. But I'll die if I stay.

I don't have a support network. So I guess that's why I'm posting here. I just needed to tell someone, maybe see if anyone else has been raped by their BPSO and what they did about it.";r/BipolarSOs;13;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n5ltlw/_/
2025-09-01 11:15:47;Struggling with my partner leaving me… again.;"Me: F/43, Partner: F/39, 6 year relationship, Ontario, Canada

For context: 3 and a half years ago in Dec 2021 we had a major discussion about our relationship. Jan 2022 we ""broke up"" and 4 days later she had a psychotic break and was hospitalized for 6 weeks. After she got out, she moved across the country to try to ""fix her life"", was unsuccessful, embarrassed, we reconciled, and she moved back Apr 2022.

The doctor that oversaw her suggested bipolar but she was in denial of the diagnosis, but remained on the medication.

She recently adjusted one of her meds to take less about 6 months ago, but has never truly done anything with respect to her medication since it was first prescribed 3.5 years ago.

This time, I was on a short term reservist military deployment (at a base within driving distance from home,, but far enough that I had to live there) for 2 and a half months starting Jun 2025 and returning mid Aug 2025. During that time she started planning on moving out and leaving. When I returned mid Aug 2025, she told me she was breaking up with me. There had been no discussions prior to this about a struggle in our relationship, or that things needed to be worked on. She was full of hope and supportive prior to my leaving that I couldn't expect this. We are living together for the next month until she can move out 1 Oct into a new apartment.

I am seeing all the same signs as the last time this happened. I've seen her budget and it's not enough to sustain her; she would need a perfect set of circumstances . I know her income and she can't miss one of day of work or this all falls apart. She's chosen a place to live that costs more than the one we live in and split the cost of together. I have suggested couples counselling, so have her friends, and her parents, but she refused. Her family and friends live 5 hours away so it's not like they see her behaviour and she can tell them only what she wants them to hear to gain their support. Both her mother and her father (divorced and live separately) think her choice is somewhat reckless.

At this point, I feel if I suggest anything is wrong, I will become the enemy and there will be no chance for reconciliation (and I so desperately want to get back together).

I also don't want her to make a very expensive mistake by paying for a place to live, failing, and coming back embarrassed.

This behaviour has happened before and she has lost other partners because she felt like she needed to detonate her life and start over.

And I don't understand her present behaviour; sometimes we joke and laugh as if nothing is wrong and other times there is a wall between us, and the switch happens very rapidly.

Our place is tiny so there is no way to escape each other.

We still share the same bed and at times we still cuddle.

We still exchange I love you's occasionally.

It's been 5 days since the break-up so yes, I know it's fresh.

I admit some of this behaviour may be just to keep the peace.

Things I am willing to and have offered:

For her to go find herself, go move out, and re-evaluate

If as the move out day approaches and she reconsiders, that we can just soak up the cost of the first and last month's rent, and return/sell whatever she purchased.  It's not a sunk cost that requires her to commit to moving out.

Basically, I just want to give her the softest landing she can possibly have and for her to not be embarrassed when she comes back down to Earth.

Every fiber of my being tells me it's going to go the same way as last time and all I can do is watch.

Please help, I need some strength and support.";r/BipolarSOs;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n5dvgt/struggling_with_my_partner_leaving_me_again/
2025-09-01 10:03:08;My boyfriend is experiencing mania episodes and I am not sure what to do.;"My boyfriend has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for about 2 years. We got together over 3 months ago and it started out really well. He was super kind and loving but for the past 2 weeks he has been experiencing what seems to be mania episodes. His symptoms: talking to himself, not always aware of his surroundings, fits of laughter and slamming during these fits. I got scared since I have a sibling (no contact) who has bipolar disorder and I have ptsd from her episodes that caused abuse towards me. I tried really hard to ground him and bring him back but it became too much for me. He only recently started taking his medicine again (I had no idea he wasn't taking it). I admit I started to break down because it was too much for me to handle. I am diagnosed with major depression and borderline personality disorder and the situation cause me to relapse in my own progress. I am at a lose on what to do and how to proceed. I am wanting to talk to his psychiatrist since he doesn't tell them the full truth of his progress. I really care about him but I dont know what I should do and if I should stay in this relationship. 

*so sorry if this is terribly typed out. His episode lasted throughout the whole night and I did not get any sleep at all. ";r/BipolarSOs;9;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n5cg7u/my_boyfriend_is_experiencing_mania_episodes_and_i/
2025-09-01 04:01:04;The cold embrace of a discarded loved one;"Hello all. My spouse is undiagnosed with BD but I suspect she has type 2. A few weeks ago I was noticing a depression epidode turning into a hypomanic episode and I confronted her about treatment for these new symptoms I was now aware of. I imagine we all know how that went. She refused treatment, blew up at me, threatened to divorce me and then took our toddler and fled to stay at her parents. I should of called the police that day they left but I didn't and I've regretten it every day since.

Now I'm going through, what I believe, is the final discard after almost 6 years of marriage and just as many previous discards. They would happen once a year, at first they would last one week, then two. I would get blocked on all communication channels and my spouse would stay at a hotel. She would show up back at home and act like nothing happened, avoiding any conversation about the discard. It's been extremely abusive, to say they least, and I think I am suffering from battered spouse syndrome since for every discard, other than the present one, I believed it was my fault she was leaving. She would scream in my face that she needs a divorce on grounds of my actions before she would leave and ghost me. The only thing is she wouldn't tell me what actions she was refering too and our marriage had been fine otherwise. It was confusing to say the least.

This time it's been three weeks since I saw my daughter and wife after they left during, what I suspect, was a hypomanic episode. My wife had voluntarily sought help earlier this year in February for suicidal ideations, severe anxiety and delusions I was going to harm her and the baby. I called 911 to get her help. The ER Psych diagnosed her with depression and gave her an SSRI, while refering her to another Psych. At the time I still hadn't figured out her previous discards, depression episodes and reckless behaviour could have been related to bipolar disorder so I didn't tell the ER Psych ward anything about them.

Since the birth of our child I had been telling myself her mood swings, emotional outbursts and rage where due to post partum physical and mental complications. I didn't get consent to talk to her new Psych or family doctor at that time which I highly regret, as now I feel she may fall through the cracks and never get help. I highly suspect my spouse was misdiagnosed with depression and then the subsequent SSRI prescribed has put her into a worse state which caused her to flee during an episode.

She finally reached out as she wants to come by and pick up her stuff. She says the marriage is over and she will be getting a divorce. I don't really feel safe around this person anymore now after the curtains have been drawn back and I can see clearly this is not a me thing. I take care of mental health and I'm not in denial about the emotional abuse any longer. Being abandoned by a love one once a year for 5 years straight will harm even the most resilent spouse. I think I am done.

In one last shot to get her help I am going to get in front of a Judge next week to hopefully involuntarily have her assessed. I realize I am out of control of the situation as she is refusing treatment. All I can do now is to put up a boundary to have no contact with her while she refuses treatment and then let her divorce me. I would support her if she agrees to treatment but I think it's unlikely at this time. It breaks my heart my toddler has a mother who is so mentally ill and experiencing Anosognosia. Any advice on how to best move forward would be appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;16;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n54hry/the_cold_embrace_of_a_discarded_loved_one/
2025-08-31 19:12:02;Struggling.;"I posted my story before, I was with my ex for 9 years (lived together 8), he was undiagnosed. 

Those were years of up and downs, it wasn't easy.  This summer his mania started, he was like a different person. Looking back I can tell when something started to change. In July things got even worse, he went from crying at the thought of losing me to ""we need a break"". Then the psychosis started, I'm not sure when but it ended up with him hallucinating and attacking me very violently, he thought I was a demon. 

My neighbors saved me, police got involved, he ended up in the psychiatric hospital for 10 days where he got diagnosed bipolar. He started medications there for the first time in his life.

Then I found out he was ""in love"" with a woman who lives nearby, he approached her a few days before the attack. I found out he was also cheating online.

I have been going through a lot of emotions, I'm struggling a lot. Before the diagnosis I just felt anger, then I started to feel empathy. Now I don't know what I feel. 

I'm learning to live alone after sharing everything with someone else for years. I'm trying hard to get better, I will soon start therapy. I have no intentions of having him back in my life.

Since the psychosis he never tried to contact me, I'm pretty sure he is still manic. He is too calm, posts smiling selfies, when police notified the restraining order he just asked if he could come get his stuff. I don't think he really understands the severity of his position, there will be a trial. Old him would be terrified. 

He never tried to contact me until yesterday. He called me out of the blue, when I saw his name on my phone I froze. I didn't answer. I started shaking and I didn't stop for an hour.  I started being very afraid of meeting him. I have no idea what he wants, say hello? yell at me for whatever? ask about his stuff? He is not supposed to contact me, he really didn't understand what a restraining order is. Yes, police explained. 

I feel safe only in my home, when I go out anxiety overwhelms me, even more after his call. I have no idea what is going on in his head and that terrifies me. 

He lives with his family now, no idea if he is back to work. He has to take meds and do therapy or he will be in trouble legally.

How am I supposed to move on when he will be in my life anyway? Trial and legal stuff will be going on for a long time (I'm not in the US). 

I was told 2 weeks ago he didn't show hostility towards me, but could that change? I'm terrified he might start resenting me at some point.  Maybe someone else had a similar experience. Can the hostility start randomly? 

I don't think I will ever be able to trust someone again, I have no idea who the real him was. Did he ever care about me? I have no idea. After years of criticism and anger my self esteem is almost gone. During good periods he was loving, complimented me, was very sweet. During the bad periods everything I did was wrong. Even the way I talked annoyed him. 

I don't know how to deal with this, the thought of him being in this state for a while worries me. I have no idea if he still thinks about that other woman, she lives in my street. I have no idea if he will just show up here at my home like nothing happened. I have no idea if he will ever get back to some sort of lucid state.  His family takes care of him now, but I know it's not easy to track what he does/thinks 24/7.

2025-08-31 12:58:50;AITAH for not wanting what's best for my partner? I'm feeling pressure from all ends with no end in sight;"I'm not the most knowledgeable about this subject, so please give me some breathing room. I've been dating my partner for the past few years, and it seems like their bipolar disorder (type 2) and depression haven't shown signs of improvement, even with medication (they were diagnosed with BPD about a year ago, D about 5 years ago). Lately, I've noticed that they're not taking care of themselves at all. When I try, as gently and positively as possible, to encourage them to at least do the bare minimum, they often respond in a way that makes me feel unheard and unloved-almost as if they pity me. It hurts just standing around and watching them self-sabotage. Sometimes it's a big time turn off, I get the feeling of not wanting to be with someone who can’t even get themselves out of bed to brush their teeth when all they do is complain that they can’t do it. AITAH for showing and guiding them if they don’t do what they need to do, it will hurt more in the near future when all they do is complain?

We've been talking about moving in together, but during moments like this, all I want to do is run the other way. I worry this could become a routine occurrence that I won't be able to handle. It's very difficult for me to sit by and watch them neglect themselves, mostly just starving themselves. It's discouraging to hear us talk about our future-wanting to move in together or even have kids-when right now they're struggling just to maintain basic self-care. It sounds like a fucking nightmare having to want to care for them along with wanting to raise kids that we'd want to love unconditionally.

I understand this isn't something that can be ""cured,"" but what can I do in this situation other than walk away? I love them a lot but I’m starting to feel ignored during moments like this. I have the mindset that if I want to improve something, you have to start somewhere. For me, if I don’t guide them towards a start, I’m failing. And this is leading to me feeling like I’m walking on eggshells big time.

2025-08-30 13:09:21;What do I do?;So my best friend and I of almost 4 years started dating exactly 2 months ago. She’s been in the hospital twice before for relapsing. She got diagnosed officially by her psychiatrist and was put on meds last year and she’s gone on hiatus a good few times throughout this year and last year…it’s been almost a month (3 weeks) since she called me. She’ll (very) loosely respond to my messages and they’re usually bland responses. But genuinely grateful to know she’s there. She told me she hasn’t been taking her meds and hasn’t been able to go to any of her appointments recently for anything because of her situation at home. Her parents are verbally abusive and I’ve witnessed this firsthand. Now…today is our 2 month anniversary and she hasn’t said anything to me even after posting and texting her. The interesting thing is that she’s extremely active on social media but says to me she isn’t talking to anyone. Of course she talks to her coworkers at work and customers because she works at a restaurant. She’s had a very troubled past and she’s been through a lot. Whenever she enters a low, she either feels suicidal or attacks me verbally. I just need some advice on how to move forward. I don’t want to leave her or break up, but the last few weeks have been emotional and confusing to say the least. This has been impacting me and I just want her to be ok because I really do care about her.;r/BipolarSOs;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n3t885/what_do_i_do/
2025-08-30 01:00:50;Bipolar Dating Successes;"I have someone close to me that has a mother diagnosed with Bipolar. Her mother had her while young going through so many men that she didn't know who the father was until after the birth happened. This apparently continued while she was raising her daughter and at that point she was unmedicated and undiagnosed. It wasn't until multiple episodes one was bad enough she was forcibly hospitalized, diagnosed, and medicated or else she would have had to spend a good amount of time in facilities. 

Over time it seemed to calm down, but the mother moved back in with her parents. Even the person close to me (her daughter) states she probably can't make it out in the world on her own. The mother reminds me of a lost 8 year old trying to make it through life and I'm incredibly INCREDIBLY concerned about the daughter. The grandparents will not always be around, but the mother has rekindled a relationship that has lasted for a few years now with someone from her high school that was infatuated with her back in the day. Their relationship reminds me of a high school relationship. The mother has no responsibilities, no bills, can barely handle getting food or cooking, and 99% of her life revolves around being parented still by the grandparents. To the point they wanted to retire and move to a different state, but decided not to solely due to her. 

Thing is, the person close to me has her own mental health struggled due to being raised in that type of environment. I fear that when the grandparents are no longer in the picture she will be the one eventually having to deal with her mother. I'm concerned because if the mother does finally move out and starts living with her boyfriend, I'm assuming the relationship dynamic will change drastically. He would be the new caretaker and parent which he does not not have deal with currently. I don't see it lasting and she frequently hops off meds for no reason. 

Are there success stories out there? This guy doesn't seem to be a guy that would take over a parent role for this 48 year old woman. The only thing stopping that currently is her own parents still taking care of her like she is 8. How would the daughter prevent her life from being blown up in the future?";r/BipolarSOs;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n3cy1n/bipolar_dating_successes/
2025-08-29 13:14:57;Rough year;"I’m 5 months out from my husband’s third psychotic episode in the last eight years as well as his new diagnosis of bipolar I.

He’s been taking his meds but hasn’t gone to therapy yet and has swung into a severe bipolar depression. In addition to that, I had a knee scope three weeks ago that showed I am going to need multiple cartilage grafts plus an osteotomy on my knee or I’ll need a replacement in my 40’s. I then broke my fibula on the same side of my knee surgery last week so am in a fracture boot for four weeks. And my dog was found to have cancer last week. I’ve missed 1/3 of my shifts this month at work and didn’t have sick time to cover it because I blew through it during my husband’s psychotic episode five months ago.

I’m trying to keep everything together but it’s hard and between my health and our dog’s, I can’t push my husband to get treatment sooner than 2 weeks from now. He signed the paperwork allowing me to talk to his psychiatric provider, so I discussed my concerns with her today. I also have ADHD and his parents and my parents both suck, I’ve been on my own for everything with poor executive functioning. I haven’t been on a plane in 4 years due to everything going on. I’m exhausted and need a vacation but can’t afford it. 

I just need some support. My husband is at least not manic, but the depression has made it so he barely wants to get out of bed. I don’t have the energy to handle his issues. I’ve got my hands full between me and the dog, and have been taking care of everything since the day after I had surgery. I’m exhausted and spread thin. I do have a psychiatric and therapist of my own however.

2025-08-28 06:07:08;Bipolar bf ended our relationship abruptly;"I’m not sure what I’m exactly hoping for by positing this, maybe others have similar experiences or have advice. I think I just need to vent and process maybe. 

My (25f) now ex boyfriend (25m) ended our relationship very out of the blue about 4 days ago. For context he is diagnosed with bipolar 2 and has been medicated and in therapy for about 8 months. He was very upfront about his diagnosis when we first met and we had several conversations about his treatment and things like that. He seemed really stable and on top of things at that time. 

We first met/went on our first date a little over 3 months ago and things progressed really really quickly. I now realize it was some form of love bombing although I don’t think it was done intentionally or to manipulate me but he was genuinely extremely excited at the beginning of our relationship. He asked me to be his gf about a week after the first date. We spent a lot of time together. He said I love you about 2 weeks in and by a month we were talking about marriage and plans for living together (for context, we were talking about doing these things in like a year-2/3 years out, not immediately)
I know that might sound really crazy and like super obvious reg flags but I genuinely have never felt a connection with someone like I did with him. I really truly believed I had met my soulmate, everything felt like it was falling into place and I have never felt more seen or understood by anyone in my life. 
After about 1.5 months of our relationship I could start to feel him pull back from me a bit. Not a ton, we still spent time together and had really good days but he just felt a bit distant sometimes. He was super busy at this time so I just took it as he’s distracted or whatever and didn’t read into it too much. But slowly over the last month he’s gotten more and more distant and I could tell something was maybe wrong but I didn’t want to come across crazy. 
This past week he was still telling me he loves me, using pet names, making plans and things. Then 4 days ago I don’t hear from him all day which has never happened before. He sent a text late that night that he doesn’t want to be with me anymore and sent some bullshit reasons about us wanting different things (those “reasons” we had previously discussed many times and had plenty of open dialogue about which is why I say they were bs.) 
He did take ownership that he was a coward for sending a text and that it’s all his fault. But he immediately blocked me on all social media. I did respond to his text which I believe he did receive. I don’t know for sure but I imagine he’s now blocked my phone number as well once he got that final text from me. 
I’ve never been abusive in any way or done anything crazy so him ending things with a text and immediately blocking me make me think he just never cared about me and couldn’t wait to get rid of me. He never tried to talk to me about the supposed issues he mentioned in his breakup text. 

This is so completely out of the blue for me and I’m so devastated I have no idea what to do. This is the person I thought was the one. We were going to spend the rest of our lives together. I didn’t even consider bipolar was playing a role because he seemed so stable the whole time we were together but after reading through a lot of this Reddit page and several others it seems that this type of breakup is common with people with bipolar. 

Now I’m left thinking that either when we met he was hypomanic and that fueled the intense start to our relationship. And now he’s either back to baseline and realized he doesn’t actually like me at all… or he’s depressed and that’s played a role?

Or he was baseline when we met and it was all real and now he’s hypomanic? Idk I’m just trying to process this all. It’s the worst heartbreak I’ve ever experienced. He made me feel so loved and appreciated and then just threw me out of his life like trash with no warning. And didn’t even give me a chance to talk through it or get closure at all. How do people move on from this?

I want to text him again but I know that’s a bad idea if he is having an episode rn he won’t care at all. But I just can’t understand how he could express the kind of love he did to me and then just turn around and rip it away like it was nothing. 

Anyways, if you’ve read this far, thank you. Like I said not sure what I’m looking for from this other than venting to other people who might understand. I’m so broken :(";r/BipolarSOs;18;22;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n1upkp/bipolar_bf_ended_our_relationship_abruptly/
2025-08-28 03:13:34;I don't know what to do about my brother, and I'm the only family member in contact with him.;" I've done this to myself. My half-brother (different dads), who is 10 years younger than me, got in touch with me via Instagram 3 years ago. He said to call him and that it was important. I've been out of touch with the family, more or less, for the past 15 years for some extremely good reasons - but that's a whole other post! So I called, and he was upset about a variety of things. I haven't talked to him in years. He was living with his on and off girlfriend at the time and was having all kinds of issues - supposedly. He made various wild claims, but looking back and knowing my family it's hard to parse out what was true. I didn't realize he was in a manic episode. I felt bad for him and invited him to come out and live with us, 1500 miles away. He INSTANTLY said yes. I okayed it with my husband, and a week later he was here. One of the stipulations was that he see a therapist. He agreed. I fixed up the attic and bought a mini fridge, microwave, blender, etc so he could be somewhat independent within the house. 

I should point out here that he had been committed to a mental institution about 23 years ago when he was in college. He was picked up walking around campus naked, spent 2 weeks in the institution, and was diagnosed bipolar. Since then, he has mainly lived at home and worked off and on, never seeming to be able to keep a job together. For some reason my parents didn't make him take meds, so...

Let me say here that our family is completely dysfunctional. I left at 17, moved to NYC for a while, put myself through college, and have a great husband of 25 years and 2 awesome daughters. They are all amazed at how normal and levelheaded I am, lol. By all rights I should be a junkie living at Port Authority. Or dead. I took the brunt of a lot of the dysfunction due to being the oldest and a stepchild to one parent. They were physically and emotionally abusive to me but never got physical with my 3 brothers from what I know.

On the ride from the airport, which is a couple hours away, he told me wild stories. He said one of our other brothers and his wife were cooking meth and he thought they were trying to get him addicted by lacing his weed with it. He had no basis for this as far as I know, but this other brother is a total loser so who knows. Then he said this brother had him committed once again because he didn't want to be ""told on"" for the meth that may or may not exist. The reality turned out to be that this brother was just the one that delivered him to the institution. He had become threatening and violent with our mother out of the blue. He also said our third brother, also a loser living at home with our parents, kicked him out of the house. (Didn't happen at all - they woke up one day and he was gone) He said his dad, my stepdad, gave him a car so he could get to work but refused to give him the title (turns out he repeatedly tried to get the title to him). He also mentioned how he used to snowboard. He grew up and lived in Alabama, so NOPE. He said our mom tried to touch his genitals when she thought he was asleep. He said my mom stood up in church and accused me of being a witch to the congregation, lol. Then he told me how a bartender looked at his credit card, with his last name being Stark, gave him a crazy look and said ""like Ironman? Are you related?"" (not in a funny way, in a serious way) My brother, age 49, is extremely into superheroes. 

He moves in and I make a schedule for cleaning the bathroom with little check boxes. He agrees to it. He thinks I'm going to cook and wash his clothes for him, because that's what mom did. I remind him of the setup he agreed to before coming out. He walks around punching the air then doing prayer hands - like ALL THE TIME. He uses my daughter' expensive hair products they buy for themselves. Then turns out he's using one of their toothbrushes. He makes massive messes in the bathroom. He checks his cleaning list off but does none of it. I talk to him. Sure sure! he says but continues to do nothing. He takes the Chapstick I just bought for myself and says he thought I got it for him. He takes one of my kids' special blanket OUT OF HER BEDROOM for his own use, despite having 3 blankets folded up at the end of his bed. He walks into my teenage daughter's bedroom without knocking. I tell him to stop. He doesn't. He starts telling the older one (21 and just living there temporarily) inappropriate sex stuff. This is the first 2 weeks.

After 6 months, I buy an older fifth wheel in good shape and move him into it because he's driving us all crazy. I help him move in and realize he's never washed his brand-new sheets I bought him. They are now torn from the dirt grinding into them and I throw them out and give him some old sheets of mine. The whole attic stinks of dirty hair and rotten food. There's bags and bags of trash he never took out. I later found out a raccoon had taken up residence without him even noticing. It's only 350 square feet up there.

He got a job at Walmart right after he moved here. He works as a stocker. I had to help him fill out some pre-employment questionnaire and it was nuts how he wanted to answer the questions, but I fixed it for him and explained why his answers weren't great. He became a ""coach"", which is kind of like a department supervisor, last year. A few months ago he went to management training for 2 weeks. Great!!! But last month he had an altercation at work after someone threw keys at him. It was on video. He started out telling me ""Don't worry, I didn't lose my bonus"" then 2 sentences later ""I lost my bonus and got demoted back to stocker"" He seemed proud that he also laid into this guy in front of the manager during the meeting regarding the incident. Defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.

Meanwhile, he smokes weed all day every day. Even at work when on break. He went to a psychiatrist twice, never told him about his previous diagnosis, and got put on some kind of meds he took for a couple of weeks. He hooked up with some local 26-year-old girl known for her drug use and that's when he started doing coke. I know this because we live in a very small town. But he's telling me that she's a cokehead and he's trying to get her to quit. They break up and eventually have a violent altercation in front of a bar. He continues to snort coke. Then I hear he's also way into shrooms. I don't think the drugs are a good idea for a guy like him.

Around this time, he starts going ghost hunting with some folks that have a YouTube channel. He meets some guy through this, a former model (all his SO's are former models lol), and they hook up one night. He says ""Oh, I didn't tell you I was bi? Yeah, in Alabama I went to orgies, swingers' clubs, threesomes all the time"" I mean, wouldn't you remember telling this to your sister?!! But I don't even know if it's true. He seems to be a compulsive liar and it's too much to mention it all. I don't know if this former model even exists.

A week into their relationship, they break up. Instantly he starts dating a trans woman. He met her at a bar and started talking to her when he noticed she was wearing ""satanist clothes"". He says he's a satanist, btw. He was a Buddhist when he arrived here but knows zero about Buddhism. I took a whole class on it in college, lol. He now has satanist jewelry and lots of satanist tattoos.  This is just the past year with the satan thing.  

A couple days after meeting this woman he gets into a head on collision on a stretch of highway that's straight as can be. Everyone walked away unharmed, thankfully. He said he saw the car coming a long way off but something about his ""photographic memory and that's why he processes things faster than most people"" and that's why he didn't avoid the wreck (??!!). After looking at the photos, it's kind of more of a side swipe than a full head on. He said his Kung Fu training and surfing experience are the reason he somewhat got out of the way in the final moments. I'm pretty sure he's never surfed. They don't exactly have bitchin' waves on the Alabama coast, and I've never seen surfboards at the family house. I lived in Hawaii and surfed a lot so maybe that's where this is coming from? I also am a snowboarder, so maybe that's where he got the idea that he was as well.

So after the incident at Walmart he was already exhibiting signs of mania, and this wreck a week later spun him out completely. He thinks he survived because he's a real Superman. Like he really thinks he has superpowers. He's also in love with this new girlfriend and keeps posting about it on Facebook. They break up a few days later, because SHE had too many red flags. He also posted that this was his 3rd head on collision. He never mentioned this to me, so doubtful. And every time I talk to him, he talks about the wreck. He says he's going to sue the woman (drunk driver) and get a million dollars and buy a house. He didn't even go to the hospital. He will not stop talking about his superpowers. And how incredibly young he looks. He's in shape but looks every one of his years. Granted he was never really in the sun because all he did was play video games.

Yesterday, now 2 weeks after the wreck, he texts me that he has found ""the one"" and that she's a former model...and FAMOUS! It's this former MMA fighter who is also on OnlyFans and he had written her a fan letter. He says she got in touch and they're ""head over heels in love"" and she's leaving her MMA fighter husband for him. He says I'll meet her soon. Sure.

I don't know what to do. He really, really scares me. He keeps talking about buying a gun and I talk him out of it because I keep imagining I'm going to lose patience and call him out and then there will be a bullet with my name on it. I so regret inviting him into our lives. I'm so tired of his BS, there's so much more that I didn't include. We're talking about selling the house and then he'll have to leave the fifth wheel (we currently are on 3 acres but could move into our rental in town). I honestly don't know where he would live because rent is so expensive here plus no one is going to want him as a roommate. He's completely spiraled out of control. Walmart is forcing him to see a therapist because of the incident there (if he wants to keep his job) but he's looking for another job. He says if he goes to the therapist he isn't going to tell her about his childhood. WTH? Does he know what therapy even is?

He's constantly embarrassing me in this small town - he creeps out the bartenders, taking their pix and posting them on his Insta along with all kinds of other things and he never fails to tell everyone I'm his sister. He walks around the park shirtless so everyone can see his satan tattoos, punching in the air and talking to himself. Currently our mom is in a home with Alzheimer's and stepdad died of a heart attack. The brother that was also living at home is in prison for a while...and the third brother I have no idea where he even is. I don't know what to do. It just feels good to vent. I never knew him that well and honestly I can't stand him. I regret trying to help and don't know what to do to get him to go away. Far away. I am scared.";r/BipolarSOs;4;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n1q8fl/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_brother_and_im/
2025-08-28 02:28:46;New to This Community;"TL;DR: My wife was diagnosed as bipolar last year after a months-long, unhinged manic episode. She has been taking medication under the care of a psychiatrist since then and was doing pretty well until a few weeks ago. Uncontrollable insomnia and racing paranoid thoughts are resurfacing. Help. 

Full Story: My wife was diagnosed as bipolar a little less that a year ago at 45 years old. We've been married for almost 20 years. I had seen signs over the years, such as paranoia about family, friends and coworkers being out to get her, and lashing out at them and me for imagined transgressions. She was fired from two jobs over the years for this. I had also seen periods of depression in which she needed encouragement to get out of the house and engage in life. But I did not witness a full-blown, unhinged manic episode until last October. 

We were at a restaurant with some family members and an imagined injustice set her off. On the way home, she began screaming at me at the top of her lungs and waving her arms to the point that I did not feels safe driving. I pulled over on the service road in an unfamiliar area at which point she jumped out of the car and began hitchhiking. I followed her with the window down encouraging her to get back in the car. I finally pulled the car over and started following on foot. I was able to get one of her close friends on the phone with her who convinced her to get back in the car with me. In hindsight, I realize that this had been building for about a month. Once I got her somewhat calmed down, I was able to convince her that she needed professional help and we got her into a psychiatrist. She was diagnosed over the next few weeks and immediately started on a medication regimen. By January, she was fairly stable, but it was a bumpy and frightening ride for those three months. 

She was doing pretty well up until a few weeks ago. It started with days-long insomnia. She went three days straight without any sleep, even on sleep medication, and I would estimate that she has maybe gotten 12 hours total over the past two weeks. Last night, she was back to the racing thoughts and feelings that everything was crumbling around her, uncontrollable anxiety even on anxiety medication, and general feelings of restlessness. Again, she said that she did not sleep a wink and was having feeling of dissociation this morning. I tried to convince her to call in sick, but she refused since she has already missed three days since all of this started. She has been in contact with her psychiatrist throughout all of this, but nothing seems to be helping. I have been super supportive, telling her that her doctor will help her figure out a way to get her back on track and that I am there for her in any way she needs me. But honestly, I am terrified because she is showing many of the signs that led up to her last manic episode and I don't know how I will handle a repeat. If anyone has any bits of advice or words of comfort, they would be greatly appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;3;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n1p1dw/new_to_this_community/
2025-08-27 22:09:56;Not sure what to do in my relationship;"Hi all, I found this community today after realising that others have probably gone through what I’m going through.  
Thank you in advance for any thoughtful sharing on your part.

I’m a male (39) engaged to a female (38) who has bipolar disorder. She was diagnosed in 2020 after a very bad manic episode while we were visiting Japan. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, so much so that two of our friends flew out to bring us home (we’re from Europe).

A bit of background: we’ve been together for 13 years, and in April 2024 I proposed. She’s been a loving, fun girlfriend, sometimes a bit afraid of full commitment, and our relationship, like many others, has had its ups and downs, but mostly ups. We work in the same field (tech) and are both relatively successful in our careers. I have a much larger group of friends than she does, as she’s more reserved, quieter, and less outgoing—which is something I absolutely love about her.

After that first episode, I—like many of you—dove deep into learning about bipolar disorder (BD) to understand it better. She had a three-month depressive period after the manic episode, but after about a year things really returned to normal. In fact, she spent four years without any episode. She has been under the care of a different doctor since the first episode (after a few false starts), and I felt so comfortable that I decided to propose. I thought, “This is manageable... with the right medication, nothing is stopping her.” We scheduled another trip to Japan, and I took the opportunity to propose there. It was lovely; she was surprised and we had a great time.

Then, in August of last year, she had another episode. My anxiety spiked and we ended up in the hospital emergency room. It was milder than the first withmumbled speech, frantic behaviour, etc. and after three days she returned to normal and life resumed ended up resuming. I was fairly okay with it. I knew episodes could happen and 1 in 4 years isn't bad at all. I can could deal with that.

At the beginning of this month though, there was another one, much smaller, where she actually came to me for help saying she was feeling overwhelming anxiety. We went to the doctor's (this time no emergency thankfully), but it took her a while to rebalance - potentially a week I'd say.

Now I’m in a dark place. Maybe I’m being dramatic, but I feel cornered and unsure what to do. On one hand, she’s a loving person who relies on me to help her gauge whether she’s doing well. She genuinely wants to stay on top of her disorder—managing sleep, work stress, etc.—and take responsibility for it, which makes me think this can work. We could get married and life could go on.

On the other hand, I don’t know if I can go through another episode; it’s crushing. She changes, and I end up feeling like a caregiver rather than a partner.

So this is where I’m at. I know no one can make this decision for me, but it feels good to write it out. I’ve told my sister and one of my best friends about these doubts and they support me either way. But what should I do?

If I stay, I worry I won’t be able to become a father which is something I’ve always wanted. She asked me to wait until she was at least 35, and then the disorder appeared. I know there may be more episodes, and I fear I might stop being a loving partner and become only a caregiver. But she’s kind. She doesn’t have an ounce of selfishness. She truly loves me and I can tell that. She misses her dad (he passed), which we believe can be a trigger everytime around the aniversary of his passing, which make her very connected with her family overall.

If I leave, I don’t even know how I’d start another relationship. We’ve been together 13 years—it’s a whole life. We’ve built so much together. How would I live with leaving in the middle of an illness? She helped me when I needed it most. But maybe I could find someone who can be a partner to me, and maybe I could be a dad.

As I write this, I feel profound sorrow and I'm sad for myself, for the situation, for her... I try to distract myself and hope these doubts will blow over and we’ll be married next October, but I’m not sure. Can you tell me what to do? lol

Thanks, all.

\[EDIT\]: Yes my SO is medicated for a long time now. She's on 300mg quetiapine + 10mg olanzapine. She's now stable again since her last episode earlier this month. ";r/BipolarSOs;9;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n1i3uo/not_sure_what_to_do_in_my_relationship/
2025-08-27 04:32:32;Confused about the diagnosis;"So my ex was re-evaluated twice. I had him go for an actual hours long assessment with a Stanford and Harvard trained specialist in bipolar and schizophrenia. The conclusion was that his symptomatology did not match a bipolar diagnosis. The thing is, he *does* experience weird shifts in thinking and the God delusions and etc. However, this has perplexed me for two years now: he does *not* have any other symptoms of mania as I’ve understood it, after countless hours of research. When he’s going through his “thoughts”, he’s still sleeping at night. He’s one of those guys who, as soon as his head hits the pillow, he’s out. His speech is never pressured or rapid. He’s not high energy, in fact, my nickname for him was “steady Eddie”. His self esteem is consistently poor, there are never moments of self inflation. No spending sprees, no changes in sex drive. Can someone be manic in the absence of all the other criteria??

The other indicator was that despite being on lithium for 4 years now, his symptoms have never improved. Also, he trialed over half a dozen SSRIs and said he only got more depressed on them. They never induced mania. ";r/BipolarSOs;3;8;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n0x1gn/confused_about_the_diagnosis/
2025-08-27 04:28:51;Advice and community wanted: How do you deal with losing trust in your own memories?;"Hello everyone, this is a side account I've made to start trying to connect with others who might have been through something similar. There's so much I'd like to post, but it would quickly turn into a novel, and I'd like to try and get other peoples' opinions and advice on specific aspects of this experience at a time. 

As a gist to this, I'm a 26 year old trans man. My ex-husband was two years older. We met when I was 18 and I fell in love hard and fast. We moved in together within a year and got married when I was 21. We met in my home country where he was studying abroad, and I moved at 23 to his country of origin to continue the relationship after he couldn't stay in my home country any more and began to grow actively suicidal. At the start of this year he served me with divorce papers and told me to leave, and I am now back in my home country. I have been emotionally devastated, and it has taken months to get to the point where I can begin to unpack what actually happened beyond being consumed by how the end of the marriage made me feel, like I'm an irredeemable abuser who ruined a relationship with his soulmate. 

While he never received a formal diagnosis of bipolar, his father had it and died by suicide shortly before we met, he suspected it in himself, and he matched the criteria. He was never medicated or in treatment. In mania, he exhibited psychotic symptoms with auditory/visual hallucinations and persecution fears that frequently moved into panic attack-like breakdowns where he would cry/scream/hide/throw things/leave, become easily scared and angry, say things that were hurtful or hard to hear (eg: I'm only still alive because you need me). He would want comfort, but it was a coin toss if it would help or make it worse. If I waited until the episode was over before offering comfort, it could also be seen as abandonment and make it worse. Afterwards, he often wouldn't remember what he'd done. The depressive episodes could last for months, and would be characterised by suicidal intent, anhedonia, complete withdrawal from affection, and difficulties with chores, eating, hygiene and work. 

Now to the part I'm here to ask for help with. I had my mastectomy back in 2018. I would have been waiting much longer for it without his help, likely at great cost to my mental and physical health. Neither one of us is wealthy, which made him helping me to pay for it privately after knowing eachother for less than a year a huge gesture. As well as helping financially, by the time it happened we were living together, and he came with me to appointments, to the surgery, and cared for me post-op. I unfortunately had a complication after surgery, and was on strong opioids for about a month. I have little to no memory of this period. He told me afterwards that in that period I was extremely aggressive, blamed him for letting this happen to me, insisted on being in control of my own medication, and would routinely make him leave the apartment and not let him near me. He named people who he needed to call to come and convince me to let him stay and take care of me, and told me it was a traumatic experience for him and those friends. He also told me he blasted through about £2k worth of savings on food, care items, and entertainment to help me recover and keep me happy. I believed him, sought therapy, and didn't broach the subject with those named friends. 

In my mind, I've drawn a line between the version of my ex-husband from when we lived in my home country, and the version from after moving. The former was the one I really fell in love with. Things weren't faultless and there had been incidents relating to his mental health, but I wasn't 100% okay either, and I had never felt threatened. I had been overjoyed to marry him, felt lucky to be loved by him, and comforted by his presence. The latter, I felt yo-yo'd between extreme highs of love and comfort and lows of eggshells and fear that he'd hurt himself, me, or someone else. He spoke to me in ways he never had, and I had never felt so far away from him and on edge while in the same room like that before. He told me I was abusing and manipulating him, and told me I had said incredibly hurtful things I didn't remember saying. Because I had apparently said these things during times of great stress, I thought it was possible I had blocked it out. I wanted him to feel heard and didn't rule it out, and so again, believed him. In the fallout of him serving for divorce, I've lost the belief I'm a good person, and the friends we had together in his country have stopped responding to me. In grieving the relationship, I kept finding myself thinking of that pre-move version of him and the love that was there. 

This month, I felt strong enough to go on a domestic trip, and went to see old friends of mine from the city I used to live in with my ex-husband. This included the named people who I was told had to intervene after I'd had surgery. I asked them about it, and none of these friends said they'd needed to convince me to let my ex-husband stay in the apartment. I spoke to different people who spent time with me in that period, and none of them spoke of me being agitated or aggressive or tension between me and my ex. I was told I was definitely out of it, but pleasant enough, and that my ex was seen giving me my medication on at least one occasion. They detailed movies we'd watched together or meals we shared, and it triggered memories that they corroborated. 

This absolutely floored me on several levels. Believing I had treated him like this was a major internal justification for staying through years of difficulty in his home country. I constantly felt like I was failing because he helped me through my own crisis, while I was feeling crushed trying to help him with his. It blurred the line between these versions of him I'd drawn in my mind. I can no longer put the pre-move relationship on a pedestal, and if I choose the story of my friends over what I was told by my ex, it means I was completely unaware I was being lied to and that the abuse may have began before we even got married. It also casts doubt on the abusive things he told me I did that I don't remember doing. Believing I had been a bad husband almost justified how I was treated these past few years and made him filing for divorce make sense as much as it hurt. Now, I don't know where I stand. 

I still struggle every day with missing someone I loved so deeply and strongly. I would have done anything for him, and I don't know what it would have taken for me to be the one to leave, but the more I unpack the less I can blame myself for how things turned out, which is less comforting than I thought it would be. I'm realising the extent to which I'm traumatised by the past few years and the damage it's done to my trust in myself. 

I welcome any advice, sympathy, or words of wisdom from anyone with similar experiences. ";r/BipolarSOs;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n0wxy4/advice_and_community_wanted_how_do_you_deal_with/
2025-08-26 16:45:13;Am I crazy?;"I didn't really know where else to go for this. But I'm (29M) going through a sudden separation with my wife (28F). We have been through one once before 2 years ago. A few months before the first separation she was diagnosed with type 1 Bipolar. She took some meds for a bit but the side effects scared her off of them. She has been off meds ever since 2023. Fast forward we were back together and working on our marriage. Never really thinking maybe her Disorder might have caused some of the fallout we had experienced. Now in July she all of a sudden wanted to move out and seperate. We had had some issues again and I didnt go to a funeral with her back in June. She was devastated I didn't support her through that moment. But her intial reasoning for the seperation was ""to work on ourselves, this could be good for us. But the door for her was closed on me and she wanted to stay friends."" 

I having begged and chased her last seperation was open minded and partially had hoped that we might still have a chance. But what has followed since has been such a Rollercoaster. Literally the next day she went off in the middle of the night and had impulsive relations with some guy, she got a place in her name and was going to move in with her friend (32F), she was transferring jobs, and was going to try and do this all in the span of 2 weeks. That didn't realistically happen. She stayed under the same roof for me for almost a month, she legit felt like a different person. All of a sudden ""glow up"" posts, hot girl summer clothes, wore make up more (never had really before), was cold amd distant towards me and our pets. 

Its all been fast and furious. She has changed up her story some too. Saying shes been pulling away since March, but telling other people different stories. She has been cold but then when she left the house finally and visited to get a few things was warm and curious about what I had been doing. She made a tinder profile, admitted to being hasty on that night she went out yet then justified it as I caused her to do it. Its been a wild ride. She hasn't outright said divorce to me but has said things like ""we arent getting back together"" ""ship has sailed"" but has since stopped all her social media posting, told me she would give me back some items she borrowed but hasn't, and has been silent and not talking to me for almost 10 days now. I told her I wasn't going to speak or reach out  unless she did first. Cause its up to her to choose the marriage. As I have stated multiple times I'm willing to reconile or work on things. Which she never gave push back on I might add. 

She also scrubbed her profile of our miscarriage dates she had in memorial on her FB page. Which isn't like her at all. Everything has just felt so sudden and not like her. She has pushed this ""I'm not a bad person"" alot too during all of this and has thought people were making her out to be a villian. I've tried reassuring her I don't think that and neither do others. But this has been such a mind fuck and so not like her that I can't tell if its her illness or not honestly. I didn't really know where else to go and share this. Any insight would be appreciated. I've been told that eventually there is a ""crash"" that happens and that she might try to come back. But if anyone could maybe share their experiences or advice I would appreciate it. 

Update 9/08/2025
She has been out of the house since Aug13 and since aug 18th has essentially ghosted me. We talked about some logistical things before she left but has since been radio silence. Ive held my boundary and waiting for her to talk to me. Her birthday passed as well and I was a difficult day for me. Also a few dayas before she left the she confronted me for snooping. Not the best idea but the speed at which she had done everyhting I panicked and did it. She let me have it and when I owned my poor decision and told her I wasnt defend ling my actions but it felt like she had been cheating on me due to the speed of everything all she could say was ""yeah it was hasty but it was nice to talk to someone who hadn't betrayed my trust."" 

After awhile she came back and we had a calm discussion which is where I told her she would habe to choose me cause I woke up and choose her everyday but I wasn't going to chase after her. 

I realize I told that already. 

Anyways shes been out of the house now, hasn't spoken to me since. Its been a rough 20 days of silence and I have felt very dehumanized, thrown away and made to feel like our almost 8yr marriage was for nothing and I meant nothing. Ive tried not to lose myself too much but it comes and goes alot. I know we had a rough patch the last few months but I never expected this turn of events to happen the way they have. Still struggle to comprehend it all and seperate her from her illness. Anyways I'm doing what I can to stay busy and take care of myself just wanted to update and talk some more about it.

2025-08-26 14:39:14;Girlfriend suddenly broke up with me;"Hi Reddit, this year I went through a breakup with my partner that had recently been diagnosed with BP2. Here's the story:

We're both in college & met through a dating app in January, shortly after returning from winter break. We immediately connected and spent nearly every day together, 24/7, until summer break at the end of April. It sounds like a lot of time, but we really loved each other, communicated, were part of each other's friend groups, and supported one another, even when life got busy. We both had internships in different cities, and did long distance for about 1 month. We missed each other so much and video called every night for hours. She'd send me reels about getting married, having kids, and wanted me to meet her family very badly. We were only together for 5 months at this point, but it was like we were meant to be.

My internship was remote, and mid-summer, she convinced her parents, who were eager to meet me, to have me over for a month. I flew 14 hours to visit them, and we all got along super well. Her family really liked me and would constantly buy me gifts, food, hang out with me, etc. She used to joke with us about wanting to be a stay-at-home wife, and always told me she'd love to settle down. We go to an extremely competitive college in the US and I could tell that she felt great being back home during the summer. She worked long hours in the healthcare field but was really happy and far less stressed than she was at school. We were super happy together, and at this point, both made it clear that we intended to stay with each other forever.



After returning to school, everything quickly changed. She switched antidepressants, which gave her crazy mood swings. One hour she'd be mad at me and the next in tears apologizing and telling me she doesn't know what's happening. She switched back after a week, but always felt off. One week, she'd be focused on getting into med school, and then next, she'd have no motivation to even leave the house. Once, she stopped replying to my messages, and her lack of communication was really worrying me. 

I saw her a couple of days later, and she explained to me that she was having horrible OCD episodes (which she had in the past, but not at this level), explaining that she thinks that she's basically the ""chosen one"" and has to do the things her mind was telling her to do. The worst thing was that she'd have a compulsion to cut herself, and even to go deeper every time. One night she called an emergency line and they took proper care of her. She was diagnosed with BP2 and prescribed Lamotrigine. No one knew about her mental health issues except for me.

We spent the next few weeks together almost 24/7. She was depressed and anxious and couldn't really leave the house, so I'd cook and clean and help her stay healthy and motivated. She felt really guilty for having me do this, but I always reassured her that I did it because I love her and enjoy it, and know that she'd do the same for me.

One night she told me that she wanted to take a break for a few days so that she could focus on herself. We stopped seeing each other for a bit and didn't really interact until she texted me asking if she could call me. I figured something was wrong so I told her I'll come over instead. She was in tears and told me that we have to break up and she can't explain why. I tried to encourage a conversation about it, but it was like talking to a brick wall. She was very emotional the whole time and had me lie with her on the couch, but nothing I said could convince her to tell me the truth about what's wrong. She asked me if I wanted to reconnect in 6 months, and seemed a bit happier when I said ""sure"".

We texted for about a week after that and she'd tell me that she's not 100% sure if we should break up, but ended up leaving it off saying something like ""I've made up my mind and we shouldn't talk anymore"", with no explanation, despite me constantly telling her that I'll understand no matter what the reason is. She stopped responding to me entirely for a few days.

Eventually, I finally got through to her and we called for a couple hours one night. The entire time it felt like I was talking to a completely different person. Literally nothing she said sounded like her, it really felt like someone had just taken over or something. She was cold and made eerie statements like ""good things don't last forever"", among a bunch of other things. She told me that we broke up because we're ""not compatible in the metacognitive realm"" and told me she'd felt that way for many months and said we should've broken up way sooner. Keep in mind, less than 2 weeks before this, she was telling me how much she loves me and wants to be with each other forever. She ended the phone call saying that she's muting my notifications and will not talk to me for a couple months.

Pretty worried because no one else knows about her mental health problems. She chooses a different reason for the breakup every time some asks, ranging from ""I want to focus more on hobbies"" to ""he's manipulative"". I haven't spoken to her in a month, and didn't even text her on her birthday. Neither of us have blocked each other, and I haven't even told my friends that we broke up because I literally don't know how to explain it.

I love her, and am hoping that once her medication titrates, she'll stabilize, but honestly I have no idea what to do. I feel bad moving on because I know it's not her fault and I don't want to give up on her, but I don't know if she'll get better. 

What do you think I should do? Is it the condition or is she really just done with our relationship? Any advice is helpful. Thanks.";r/BipolarSOs;6;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n0em5e/girlfriend_suddenly_broke_up_with_me/

>Being away from where I've been for the past six years and considering how much upheaval and craziness there seems to be EVERYwhere pretty much makes me think I could/should just suck it up and stay with my husband. 🤷‍♀️😳🙃🤔

The friend texted back,
>I can definitely see and empathize with that thought!! Do what is best for you and don't give the other option (leaving or staying) a second thought. 

I didnt understand and texted,
>I don't understand that. In other words, I don't understand ""don't give leaving or staying a second thought.""

The friend then texted this, 
>It is impossible to not give leaving or staying a second thought once you have made the decision. But what I mean is, do not allow yourself to agonize over your decision to the point where you second guess or feel guilty. If it's the right choice, lead with acceptance! 

I **still** didn't understand, so the friend texted this...
>I'll try to give a terrible analogy to help. It may just be easier in person!
>But imagine you have an option to eat a chocolate cake or an apple pie. And you ponder which is the better option. You could make a pros and cons list, you could talk it over with friends, you could even pray ""God, what is the right choice?""
But once you make the choice, that's it. I cannot eat the piece of chocolate cake and for the rest of my life wonder ""but was doing that the right decision? What if I would have eaten the apple pie? Would that be better?"" 
>We cannot agonize over a decision that we have made because it has already been done. Instead, we have to lead with acceptance! I have chosen the chocolate cake, and that is where my confidence and acceptance lies. If not, I will live out my days, wondering and longing for an apple pie I can't get back.
>I hope this helps!

I texted this back...

2025-08-26 10:16:35;Is the divorce rate for Bipolar realty 90%?;"I’ve been married previously for 15 years.  Ex got caught up with a gym bro and it ran to divorce.  Not mad about it - I was not around and these things happen I guess. 

I earn enough and can afford my life and can make a SAHM - it’s not a dating app, but I’d like someone to share life with.  

Since divorce, I’ve met two women that stated they were bipolar.  Both had medication issues (cold stop, transferring to a new med, etc.).   

I don’t want another divorce, but the internet says it’s a 90% divorce rate for bipolar.  

Is it over diagnosed? Is my picker off? I’m feeling a certain way about this. 

I have kids, prior military - so I run to chaos - I get that part.  That’s my issue. 

Where do I find emotionally stable or available people?  I am not desperate and don’t want to repeat the last two years….";r/BipolarSOs;47;63;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1n09vzq/is_the_divorce_rate_for_bipolar_realty_90/
2025-08-26 05:25:20;My in-law’s ignorance is exacerbating my wife’s illness;"I have been with my wife almost 30 years.  She was diagnosed with depression almost 20 years ago.  She was then diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2017 after a terrible manic episode where she was hospitalized for 3 weeks. 

In 2017, my in-laws were aware of my wife’s mania and helped get her into a hospital.  While my wife was in the hospital she was prescribed Lithium which helped bring her back.  After being on Lithium for about 4 months, she started to have side effects including a metallic taste in her mouth.  We were referred to a new psychiatrist who prescribed Abilify and that is all my wife took for 7 years.  This new psychiatrist did not prescribe anything for the depression side of bipolar.  Looking back this was my fault in not catching it, but assumed her psychiatrist knew what she was doing.

Sometime in the summer of ‘24, my wife decided to stop taking her Abilify without telling me, her family, or her psychiatrist.  Of course we figured this out when she had a manic episode in January and declared she wants a divorce so she can “live her best life.”  I swear her speech was identical to the one she gave me 8 years prior.

When we found out she was manic, we (myself and her parents) confronted her and told her psychiatrist.  My wife then resumed her Abilify but and after 2 months her psychiatrist said she was fine, and her parents agreed.  They just thought the marriage had run its course and I was causing her discomfort. 

I still felt something was off, so I asked if we could get a second opinion from another psychiatrist which she agree to do.  She started with a new psychiatrist in April, and at her second appointment in May he prescribed her Lamictal.  The psychiatrist started her on 25 mg and I noticed a calmness come over her within the first week.  Miracle drug? At the next psychiatrist appointment, which I was invited to, I shared my observations with my wife and the doctor.  He decided to keep her at 25 mg for the next 4 weeks to see what would happen.

My wife did not want me at her fourth appointment, however her psychiatrist decided to increase her Lamictal to 25 mg twice a day.  Over the next 4 weeks my wife was not compliant with the new dose.  She said she didn’t need the Lamictal because she was fine with just Abilify.  Although she did not sign HIPAA forms allowing me to speak to her psychiatrist, I sent her psychiatrist a text message detailing her non adherence.

She had a psychiatrist appointment a week ago Thursday, and this appointment was virtual.  I had flagged to her parents that she was not compliant with her medication, so they invited themselves to the appointment.

To help prepare my in-laws for the appointment, I sent them information regarding Abilify, Lamictal, bipolar depression, Anosognosia, how the psychiatrist would speak in coded language to keep her engaged…etc.  I thought I did a pretty good job…boy was I wrong.

After the appointment I heard from her parents.  Their takeaways included that she is not a harm to herself so she is fine (wow, that’s a low bar for mental health.) They also told me that Lamictal is 100% OPTIONAL (I had no idea Lamictal which has to be titrated slowly and builds over time is now a PRN…yes that is sarcasm.). Her parents are also pushing for family therapy as we have one child who just graduated from college and one in high school. We tried couple’s therapy over the past two months, but this doesn’t really work when one party is unstable, emotionally reactive, and lacks insight into her own behavior.

Now here is the kicker.  The psychiatrist changed her  Lamictal from IR to XR so she would only have to take her medication once a day.  He kept the dose at 25 mg to build her trust and help re-titrate.  And on top of switching to XR, he instituted weekly check ins to confirm her compliance with taking her medication.  Lastly the psychiatrist asked for the next appointment to be in person.  

My in-laws continue to assert that the Lamictal XR is optional, that the weekly check ins for compliance were my wife’s idea, and that it was their idea for the in-person appointment.  The psychiatrist is 2 hours from where we live and my wife previously said she would only continue to see him if virtual.  

Sorry for this long-winded rant, but it is infuriating that her parents are unable to clearly see she is now being treated with Lamictal for depressive symptoms or how the psychiatrist is communicating with her to get her to comply.  I guess stupid is as stupid does.

2025-08-25 23:52:19;From happily married to divorcing within 6 months;"Hi all, my life has been flipped upside down in the matter of weeks. My ex-spouse had her first manic episode early February and was hospitalized (mid-late February) and diagnosed with bipolar 1. The psychiatrist had put her on lithium and Risperdal and emphasized to me the importance for her to take this medication. My ex-spouse was also court ordered to take the medication (that’s another story) so she was forced to. 

Soon after she got out of being hospitalized, she was very adamant that she wanted to date other people but still wanted to have a marriage with me so she stated she was polyamorous and needed it right now. I told her I could potentially be open and needed time to adjust to that lifestyle but if she wanted it right now this minute, then I couldn’t do it and that we should separate. She didn’t want that but continued to be upset at me for not being ready already. Then, around mid-April, early May of taking the medication, she started to stabilize. She was still adamant about being polyamorous but was happy to go slow since she cared about me and the marriage. I was starting to feel hopeful and happy, connected to her. 

While all this is happening, she tells me that she doesn’t need the medication and is not being honest with the psychiatrist about her symptoms. She said that her psychiatrist wouldn’t understand her and that the manic part is her “bad bitch energy” which keeps her out of her shame. I recommended for her to be honest but she would lash out if I tried to convince her. So, from February to late May, the psychiatrist tapered off the Risperdal to eventually removing it completely. 

Then, late June, she goes on a work conference and cheats on me twice. When she got back, she told me that I should be happy that she even told me because she was originally planning to not tell me. During couples counseling, when we talked about the infidelity, she lashed out on me AND my therapist. She was claiming that the therapist was judging her and the therapist calmly explained that she was supporting the both of us and that she’s trained to not judge. My ex-spouse did not believe her and became hostil. To the point where she almost didn’t pay the therapist at the end of the session. 

After that couples therapy, things clicked for me. She didn’t accept her diagnosis and wanted to be off her medication. She started believing that her manic energy is a part of her and doesn’t want to suppress it. And I, couldn’t put myself through that instability anymore.

We were together for 9.5 years and got married this past March. I’m still in shock on how everything has changed so drastically. I’m now filing for divorce which she is onboard with. She really wants the divorce because it’ll give her “absolute freedom” which is all she ever wanted ever since she was hospitalized. I feel completely discarded. Traumatized. And on top of everything, the grief of losing someone that was so near and dear to my heart. 

If anyone has any words of advice during this truly difficult time, please share. Never in a million years did I ever think this would happen. I went from happily married to losing a loved one and filing for divorce in about 6 months 😞

2025-08-25 08:26:48;Vent more than anything;"I’ve been married to my wife for 7 years now.  I knew the first night she was the one. Today, is the first day I question if she is who I met. 

My wife is currently in a hypomanic manic episode. Not positive it’s not a manic episode. She was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few years back  but I knew she had it before that. She only agreed to see a psychiatrist because I had to tell her to leave our house. She got on meds and was a zombie, but eventually got them ironed out. Everything was getting better and I started to see the woman I fell in love with again. She’s been in her manic episode now for 2+ weeks. Last week she was trying to start an argument while our child was awake and about to go to sleep. I told her we’d talk after they’re asleep. She blew up and stormed out threatening suicide. I had to wake our kid up and go find her. Things settled down and she’s been working on her side hustle now thst she’s had for years but doesn’t do much with it. Now she gets home from work and pretty much ignores me and the kid unless she needs something. She’s been wanting me to build this stand for her and she had in her head it was today, but didn’t communicate any of that with me. She did communicate about 27493 different style stands she used for inspiration. While talking she said the video I sent you. I responded with “what one?” That instantly turned into all hell breaking loose. She started screaming like normal and yelled she hated me twice. I’m very good at compartmentalizing due to the nature of my work or fucked up childhood. That? That I can’t compartmentalize. After about 2 hours of playing outside with our kid(he was already out there during the fight thank god) she came out talking like nothing happened. 

Now she has threatened divorce until I told her the next time she threatens it, she better mean it cause I’ll file. To me divorce isnt a tool to be used when you’re mad and I explained that. She agreed and hasn’t mentioned it. I take my vowels very seriously and have stuck it out through “sickness… and bad times” but idk. I never wanted my kid to grow up with divorced parents. I’m also hesitant as I’m a dude. Men always get fucked by our courts and I grew up without a dad. I REFUSE to let my son go through the same thing. Especially because he’s been so attached to me since he was an infant. Again due to the nature of my job I’m home almost everyday with him so it makes sense. I’d rather suffer so he wouldn’t have to. 

Is it ever possible to get the woman I fell in love with back? I hear from her friends and previous people she took care of how much of a sweetheart she is. All I get is the verbal abuse and used as a punching bag. I’m exhausted ";r/BipolarSOs;9;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mzc87b/vent_more_than_anything/
2025-08-24 11:56:33;Fiancé is in the hospital;"The last few months have been rough. My (28M) fiancè (27F, diagnosed with bipolar 1 and medicated) has finally been admitted to the hospital. She's been hospitalized 3 times since May so far, though nothing longer than 20 hours until now. While I know that she's in a place that she needs to be, I'm struggling with it.

I'm feeling a lot of guilt and sadness right now. The logical part of me knows that this is absolutely necessary, especially with how bad the past few months have been, but having her calling me crying from the hospital has been weighing on me heavily. I also just miss her. This is the first time in four years we've been apart for more than a couple of days, and it's rough.

2025-08-24 02:36:22;Partner better, but one manic idea won’t fade;"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend was diagnosed with bipolar about 3 years ago. His first doctor put him on Latuda and Lamotrigine, and he did great — perfectly stable with no episodes. Sadly, that doctor passed away, and his new doctor wanted a more “holistic” approach. He took him off those meds and put him on Lithium back in Dec/Jan. At first he seemed fine, but soon the episodes started again.

That doctor didn’t want him back on Latuda and prescribed Olanzapine to help him come down. It helped somewhat, but came with heavy side effects. After 5 months (by May), we were frustrated and got a new doctor, who put him back on Latuda (40 mg) and Lamotrigine (200 mg). She’s gradually tapering him off Olanzapine.

Since then, he’s improved a lot — maybe 95% back — but the recovery has been slower than before. Olanzapine also caused him to gain 45 lbs quickly. He had a six-pack before, and now he has a big gut. That shift has been hard on him and us emotionally, since he always took pride in his fitness.

The main issue left is one grandiose idea from mania that hasn’t gone away: he’s convinced he’s building an AI investment fund for real estate and film/TV. He’s made a website, created investor decks, and even contacted Amazon, VCs, and crypto investors. He talks about making billions. All the other manic thoughts are gone — but this one has lingered for over a month.

I love him deeply and want to be supportive, but I’m running out of ways to handle this. Has anyone else had a loved one hold onto a single manic idea long after the rest faded? And how did you deal with the side effects like sudden weight gain?

Thanks ❤️

2025-08-23 05:12:05;Is it too late for us? Finding out my partner has bipolar 2 years into the relationship;"So as the title states my partner recently got diagnosed with bipolar 2. Throughout our relationship I’ve always known something was wrong and they acted out of character, but in their heart there was so much love and good. We were long distance for year and some change and there was a lot of challenges, but again I knew there was trauma and hurt there and it was something I was more then willing to work out with them because I loved them so deeply. 

Then I moved in. Screaming matches, controlling behavior, insults and then randomly peace. Then depressive episodes then happiness. I found myself anxious, walking on eggshells, confused and sad. Wondering what I was doing wrong. How could I be a better partner. What more could I do. Now a year later right before I was considering ending it they finally get a bipolar diagnosis. The threat of me leaving finally cause them to seek out a psychiatrist, a better therapist (their old one sucked) be less controlling. Everything I wanted. I’m now realizing that they may have finally broken out of a months long manic episode. 

I feel like I’m looking at the person I fell in love with again. But for some reason it feels so bad. Like someone I knew once who died was suddenly raised from the dead. 

Has anyone else felt like this? I feel broken. Is it time to move on? Or is this still fixable. I feel like a horrible person, the more they change for the better the more hurt and confused I feel.

We have our first marriage counseling session ever, and I don't know if he will disclose his mental health struggles.  He just told me today he will not medicate, that he has accepted himself and is heartbroken that I haven't.  I didn't ask him to be medicated, he went on his own and then we got into a fight because he asked me how much of our marriage issues is due to his chemistry.  When I fumbled over the answer, it seems like that tipped him towards not medicating.  I am worried that every thing I could say in counseling will be wrong and end up being destructive.  I am so sad that our life is not working out together.  I am heartbroken too for both of us.  I know no one here knows us or our relationship, but any advice for our first counseling session would be helpful.

2025-08-22 11:24:06;Why do *I* feel like I'm the bad person in all of this?;"My BP husband was involuntarily admitted (via EDO) to hospital on Monday, August 11 around 9 p.m. after he told a police officer he was going to drive his car (with two flat tires) to a restaurant to get something to eat. NVM all the other things he'd done earlier that day which IMO should've been enough to have him admitted. 🙃  By Wednesday or Thursday, a judge had signed an OPC (order of protective custody) to extend my husband's stay. Husband was apparently released yesterday late afternoon or early this morning.

While he was in hospital, husband flip-flopped a few times on whether he'd allow the hospital staff to communicate with me. Last I knew anything of THEIR diagnosis, it was ""unspecified mood disorder"" and he was refusing meds and assessments. Doctor said they were considering BP disorder, depressive disorder, and cognitive disorder.

He drained our only joint bank account of EVERYTHING sometime between 6 p.m. yesterday and 8 p.m. today.

So, why do **I** feel like the bad guy???

We bought tickets to go to a convention a year ago (which I can't get a refund on) but my hotel I still will be able to get refunded ($1000+). She has been looking forward to this convention for a few months, but got freaked out over the weekend going up someone's house with about 10 people in attendance, this convention is projected to be close to 100k. I know she wants to go, but I feel I will personally be miserable since I have to worry about her mental state the entire time. **Should we attend in the hopes that going to something she has anticipated for so long will improve her mental state or should I prioritize myself my own feelings and cancel?**

*Context: She has been diagnosed with Bipolar for over 5 years and has been medicated since that time. She talked to her doctor yesterday in which she was prescribed Buspione that she is taking in addition to the Seroquel and Lithium she has already been prescribed.*

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone that gave me advice. I end up telling her I did not want to go to the convention and in-turn, she decided not to go either. Since we are both off from work during this time, she is becoming too much to constantly be around in thie state. I will likely get a hotel later today to just enjoy the rest of my ""vacation"".

I’m in the process of divorcing my BP husband. I just recently dipped my toe back into dating, not really looking for anything serious. Just perhaps some companionship. Well, I hit it off with someone far more than I expected and yesterday he shared that he too has a BP diagnosis. My head is spinning a little. 

With my ex, I was very naive. He was never med compliant, abused substances and could become quite abusive. While I recognize he is a troubled man and do not think he is an inherently bad person, I am pretty traumatized by the entire experience. I used to be pretty focused on trying to understand how much of his behavior was attributed to his disorder or substance abuse but have come to a place of letting all of that go.

Though this new person seems more self aware, my ex also disclosed early on and I can see now that he was never fully honest and was very, very manipulative. I think I know in my heart of hearts the answer is to take more time to focus on healing myself, I guess I’m just looking to share my experience or hear what others think.

My spouse is a teacher in a major U.S. metro district so we essentially get 30-40 new kids a year. After working part-time, nearly full-time hours, during summer she’ll essentially be working two full-time jobs until end of the school year.

I work full-time, with some OT, from home so it’s easier for me to pick up household chores … so while they are boring, having a rigid schedule of tasks helps further with the daily structure I need to maintain. I think it’s fair to say that we need to be diligent in our health, almost like it’s a job itself and the responsibility having one entails.

So I’m taking it easy while eliminating as many stressors for my spouse during this first week of school. … We’re lucky that I can take this time to just focus on my health in the moment, but so many of you don’t.

We don’t have kids at home and I barely can imagine how much parenting would be complicated with BP in the picture. I’m blessed to have the PTO to take time to take it easy.

He is a HUGE researcher, extremely intelligent, reads voraciously every day, absorbs incredible detail from all kinds of scholarly publications both on and offline. He thinks his memory is terrible but it’s actually pretty darn good. He is versed in economics, politics, history, socialism, religion, geography, so many subjects interest him. He’s a really interesting person! But as far as his first very scary differential dx (bvFTD) and now the more likely BD dx, he has nil interest. None. I keep thinking if he read a lot of these posts he would recognize his own behavior in SO MANY of them. It’s uncanny how similar the behaviors are even if the specific details differ. Now that his mania seems to have subsided I’m thinking of trying to get him to read some things. It may sink in. I think the most likely path for him to agree to treatment is the path toward dementia that he’s on. I believe he’s been bipolar at least as long as we’ve been married (30 years) and more than likely many years before that.

2025-08-20 11:19:12;Considering divorce;"Hi, I’m so glad to have found this sub and know there are others like myself in this situation. My husband was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a year and a half ago. We were separated for a brief period until he (involuntarily) went to receive treatment and was put on meds. He takes the meds however has since stopped therapy and has been abusing alcohol. I feel like I just live in this state of when is the next episode going to happen, will he decide to stop taking his meds, etc. We have a young child and I worry that the drinking while being on meds and around her is not safe. I’ve spoken to him (and his family) about his behavior and they are no help. No one can convince him to take better care of himself. 
This situation has really taken its toll on me. I feel very stressed most of the time and it is like living with an adult child. He has other mental issues and it’s becoming too much. We don’t connect like we used to and barely seem to have anything in common anymore. I’ve been considering for some time if this is worth it and to start looking into divorce. I never imagined my life going this way. But I also understand this is a lifelong disease that he has to manage, I can’t do it for him. When I have mentioned that I’m unhappy and state I want a divorce he will manipulate me by saying how he loves me, doesn’t want a divorce, will make it harder for me, doesn’t want to be alone, etc. I’m wondering if anyone has advice for what to do? I don’t know if I should give it more time or to start looking into a divorce. I guess I need to “pick my hard”.

2025-08-20 05:05:27;Late-onset psychotic break after a long marriage?;"Hi everyone, I’m posting here because I don’t know anyone in real life who’s been through something like this, and I’m trying to make sense of it.

I was married to my ex for 20 years, together for 28. With hindsight, there were signs of instability all along: he never worked (said he wanted to be a stay-at-home dad), went through long periods of depression, was diagnosed with cyclothymia early on, and often struggled with motivation. But nothing ever suggested paranoia or delusions. That all changed after he turned 40. He started to get steadily worse; with episodes that started to seem more like bipolar2, but not at all like bipolar1. He stared to accuse me of being abusive and he started to have periods of sleeplessness and obsessions with various political campaigns. 

Then few years ago, he went into what I now understand was a long bipolar 1 manic episode — about a year in total— and for the first time I saw paranoia and delusions creeping in. Out of nowhere, he initiated a divorce after a big family trauma that was his fault. It was shocking and painful, but I thought maybe this was the bottom, maybe with treatment he could stabilize.

Instead, things got worse. After the divorce, he had what I can only describe as a total psychotic break. He was arrested a few weeks ago on two felony charges. He started talking about one of our teenagers as a deity, believing in wild conspiracy theories, and spinning farther and farther out. Our kids (both teenagers) have chosen to cut off contact with him completely unless he agrees to inpatient treatment, which he refuses to do.

He insists he’s under a psychiatrist’s care (had to prove he was to stay out on bail, and his psych says he is complying with treatment). He tells  family and friends he’s “better than ever,” but from the outside I can’t see how that could be true. He’s facing jail time and has lost his kids. 

He refuses to take responsibility for anything, publicly blames me for turning the kids against him, and seems completely detached from reality. I feel so angry at his denial, and at the same time I feel deep grief — this is someone I loved for almost three decades.

I’m in therapy, I have supportive friends, and even a new relationship, but I still find myself spinning on this. Has anyone else been through something like this — where someone seemed “misdiagnosed” or “high-functioning” for decades, and then had a severe psychotic break later in life? Do people ever come back from something like this?

I guess I’m mostly looking for validation and solidarity. It feels surreal to watch the father of my children unravel at almost 50 years old, after all those years of a life we built together.";r/BipolarSOs;18;25;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1muv1t3/lateonset_psychotic_break_after_a_long_marriage/
2025-08-20 03:58:25;Can’t get my husband to see a doctor;Hi everybody - my husband and I have been having a lot of issues the past couple of months. It started when he went out of town and was physically aggressive with his brothers during an argument and ending up running away for the evening (literally, he left his wallet, keys, phone and just ran away in the woods). His family was calling me saying they didn’t recognize him in that state of mind. His dad finally called me privately and told me a family member was diagnosed bipolar and this could be potentially what my husband was going through during his episode with his brothers. Once my FIL told me that, it made a lot of things click that have happened during our marriage. There was a moment a year ago where he was physically aggressive towards my son and I, and I haven’t gotten past how it didn’t seem like him behaving that way. I told my husband I’d like for him to get assessed by a medical professional to see if it is bipolar or something else. He is firmly in the position that I am the cause of all his stress and this is what causes his “mental breaks”. So I agreed to do marriage counseling as well. However now that we are in therapy, he refuses to see a medical professional to get a proper diagnosis. We definitely have our issues to work through, but I still think he needs to be assessed for something deeper. I don’t know what to do. It feels like every time I have a conversation with him about him seeing someone, or our problems - I feel he is on the verge of a breakdown just talking about it! I feel stuck in limbo and now I have his family calling being very concerned about him because he has been ignoring all their calls and texts. Any advice?;r/BipolarSOs;6;7;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mut80a/cant_get_my_husband_to_see_a_doctor/
2025-08-19 05:45:31;Breakup 1000;"I've been with my fiance for 5+ years now and to say it's been a rocky road is an understatement. When he was diagnosed BP2 I thought it was finally the answer and meds would be our magic fix. Add in a history of addiction and ADHD and I've determined there is no fix. Over the years I've found every sign and symptom of infidelity but the actual act. Today while prepping for an upcoming trip I opened up a camping towel and out fell a box of condoms and bottle of lube. I assure you it's not for me b/c even if we used those things we haven't had sex in months. This is not the first time I've found condoms. His reasoning is that since the box is still sealed he's clearly done nothing wrong. He's also in the throws of a shopping addiction that he keeps telling me he's getting under control but the number of order confirmations I found today says otherwise. 

Of course he thinks I'm controlling and paranoid. I can track his location on my phone so that should prove he's innocent. B/c it would be impossible for him to leave his phone behind in the truck when he goes on these overnight fishing trips. But I was honestly not trying to find something this time. I knew something was up based on his behavior but I wanted to wait until after this trip to rip that bandaid off. Instead it smacked me in the face when I least wanted it to. 

He just doesn't want to help himself and any offer of outside help is a personal attack. I try to be sympathetic...maybe too much so. There's always some extenuating circumstance that makes me stay. A miscommunication, medication adjustments, now his testosterone is critically low. Maybe if we just fix this next thing he'll finally get it together, right? 

He wouldn't know how to tell the truth if it was shoved up his rear to regurgitate. He's gotten really good at apologizing but even better at hiding. Every time I give him an ounce of trust it comes back to bite me in the ass. We have been in couples and individual counseling for 4+ years. Things are getting worse instead of better. 

I just wanted to finish this trip. It's all reserved in his name so I'm screwed on just going without him or I would. The irony is he's broken up with me in this scenario. As soon as I confronted him with what I found he said he was done b/c somehow I'm in the wrong here. Either way, the outcome would be the same. I just found it funny. I feel like I've flushed the last 5 years of my life down a gas station toilet.

Thank you for listening to me moan. Any words of wisdom, sympathy, or even hope (?) are welcome. ";r/BipolarSOs;5;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mtzliy/breakup_1000/
2025-08-19 04:24:47;Back from 6 week road trip;"Quick UPDATE: Today when we picked our 5 year old up from school, my husband made a point of sincerely apologizing to her for being mean on Sunday. She was giddy with happiness. I am heartened by his apologizing. (Would love it if he’d apologize to me!) Still have hope he will agree to treatment. 


My as yet undiagnosed (don’t know if BP 1 or 2 or what it is) is back from his solo 6 week cross country road trip. I’m very glad to have him home. I detected that he was still slightly manic so have held off on any serious discussion around his mood/treatment/boundaries I’m about to lay down.  This morning he was staring outside and when I asked what was happening he said, “ I’m depressed.” 

Yesterday we had our 5 and 7 yo granddaughters here all day after a sleepover. Something happened that made me think he was still manic, but now I wonder if it wasn’t a harbinger of depression after all. We were playing a board game. He got pissed about the way these little girls played and QUIT IN A HUFF. Made the 5 yo who literally WORSHIPS him cry. Last night when we were alone I told him he needed to apologize to her the next time we see her (we have them 3 days a week at least). He adores those little girls and I know he wouldn’t knowingly do anything to hurt them, but he did. I’m wondering if the shame of that incident (exacerbated by my telling him he needs to apologize) could have triggered the rapid crash. 

At any rate, I’m hoping he will be amenable to some kind of treatment now that the switch has flipped. Because I realized yesterday that the red line I have to draw is about those little girls. Hurting them is the unforgivable thing that I will not be able to get past. And that I will prevent at all costs. 

I feel bad that he’s depressed. But it validates my hypothesis that he is bipolar even tho he doesn’t have an official diagnosis. Looking back on our 30 years of marriage, I now recognize many episodes of mania and the subsequent depression. The mania is almost always partially dysphoric and entailed verbal and emotional abuse. I cannot allow him to do that to the little girls. I feel horrible enough I didn’t remove my now-adult kids from that situation growing up. 

Two doctors have offered him lithium. This seems like the simplest way to initiate mood stabilization. Does it help with depression too? I think I’ve read that. I’ve also read it has a neuroprotective effect. The extremes of mood have got to be hurting his brain. He’s almost 69, untreated for all these years. I’m hoping the specter of dementia will lead him to agree to treatment. 

All your thoughts are welcome. ";r/BipolarSOs;5;5;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mtxfll/back_from_6_week_road_trip/

I've been with my husband for 14 years now... wow, so much time just swallowed whole.  I'm the one who does everything, because if you have a bipolar spouse, especially a husband, we all know he can't do anything! So here I am doing everything and dealing with all his mental shit, and now I have developed some bullshit of my own... caregiver's depression, seriously!  Yes, 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with this crap. I take meds so I don't rip his face off... <---- not sarcasm!  I recently had to start taking a new med because the med I was on fizzled out... I can never talk to him about anything, share my feelings, or just talk about my day. He doesn't listen or even seem to care, and in the rare moments he ""acts"" like he cares, he forgets he does, and it's back to being self-centered. I'm always the villain and he's always the victim, always! I have been the one to advocate for him, always make sure things are just right for him, and I put my health and mental health off to make sure he was ok. I have triggers now because of him, seriously. His huffing and puffing, or if he raises his voice, or shuts a door too hard... like WTF! I have 1 friend, and she barely understands what it's like. I have a zero support system. I have no idea how I've made it this long, sheer spite? I just want to be happy. I used to be such a happy, funny girl. He stole my joy, and I want it back. I think we need to part ways. I know we do. I know he's not right ""mentally,"" but you will never convince me he doesn't know what he's doing and doing it on purpose, some of the time!

2025-08-18 12:49:52;don't know what to do...;Don't know that I'm looking for advice. Just need to get things off my chest. Spouse (we've been together almost 22 years) recently has been having mental health issues. Very recent diagnosis of bipolar I. They seem to be in the midst of a manic episode. They've been to the hospital twice and the first time, they were kept longer than 72 hours. After being released from the most recent 72 hour hold (only a week and a half after the first hospitalization), they came home and promptly punched a hole in one of our walls. They mentioned being referred to a place for treatment and medication (during that convo., they sounded like they were willing to take lithium). They've not followed up on the referrals and they're not acting like that's a priority.  Two days ago, they screamed at me in public and got louder, angrier, and way more in my personal space when I did not respond the way they thought I should. They blocked my path to the exit and punched the wall right next to my head. They've never acted like this before - they've not been violent in the past, but their recent actions have been unpredictable- and increasingly aggressive. Spouse has  scared the kids several times over the past couple of weeks and left them in tears. I left the home with our 2 kids after my spouse struck the wall next to me with their fist. I'm afraid the next time they get the urge to hit, it's not going to be something but someone. Now looking at emergency protective order. I don't think I'm overreacting. They've begun to purposely intimidate me and the children physically. They haven't threatened violence yet, but they've threatened my property and pets. I'm concerned for the kids' safety and for mine, but I'm also genuinely concerned for my spouse. I know they're not in a healthy frame of mind right now and they need help, but I can't force them to get it. I love them, but the kids and I can't live in constant fear. I don't know how to get my spouse back. I don't know if I can. I hate everything about this. ;r/BipolarSOs;11;9;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mtcnjg/dont_know_what_to_do/
2025-08-17 21:40:14;SO isn’t himself anymore;"My husband (M 37) was recently diagnosed with BP1 in January of this year. We had an intense end to 2024. Here is some background: 

While I was 34 weeks pregnant with our second child, we decided to purchase a property where we could run our business (lawn care) and live. It was a tough decision because we were so comfortable at our current residence, but the landlord for our business wanted to increase the rent 8x and it just wasn’t feasible. So we sold our house, and bought this new property. However, during that time, Sept to Jan, my husband went manic with psychosis. We were having trouble securing a mortgage because this new property didn’t have the right permits for most of its buildings so the appraisal kept coming back lower than what we were buying it for. His family was unhelpful. He asked them for guidance and temporary help and instead of just saying no, they used that opportunity to pass judgement on him and my family (whom they had only met once at our wedding). I think the stress made him feel abandoned and he just finally cracked.  

In January, he sought out help and found a psychiatrist. He was put on Abilify. His doctor wanted him on 15mg but he’s only ever been able to get to 7.5mg. It makes him tired, lethargic and unmotivated. He’s been on and off it by himself 4 or 5 times now. I think the longest he’s ever been on it was for 6 weeks. He just wants to self medicate with weed and alcohol because thats how he’s managed this his entire adult life. 

His doctor recommended lithium to try since Abilify doesn’t seem to be working. 

I’m also having trouble with his diagnosis. We’ve been together 13 years and married for 6. We have two children. I have only ever known him to be manic or hypomanic. Before last winter, I just thought that’s how he is. And now this version of him just hurts my heart. I feel like I don’t know him anymore. 
He is a complicated man, BP1 and Hyperactive ADHD. Thank god he’s not on stimulants. Because that would be a disaster. 

I’m just looking for some support. It’s been a tough time for both of us. And I just want to know it’s okay for me to feel this way. Because I feel so guilty.

Let me start first and waiting also for your inputs:
1. The loneliness of my BP ex. He was living in a room in his house before we start dating, doing nothing except all night playing pc games. No friends, no social interactions, non stop changing jobs, after a week or month.
2. He eas saying "" Money means nothing to me"" and was full of credits while able and capable to work.
3. The permanent fatigue.
4. Sudden anger and few short discards.
5. The emptiness in their eyes. Even in the most personal moments even looking at me, for 20 years i didnt see anything in these eyes but a void or surface of enthusiasm, but not any depth. 
6. The unreal offers he has made- to go on a trip that neither of us could pay.
7. Non stop changing hobbies.
8. The excessive spending.
9. No dreams or long term goals or purpose, like floating in time.

2025-08-16 19:15:11;Lost;"Hello,

I don't even know where to start. I'm just glad I found this place, I feel less alone.

Please excuse my English, it's not my first language and at the moment it's hard for me to even express myself in my own language.

One week ago my partner of 9 years attacked me very violently, we were home and suddenly he started yelling at me, saying that I was the devil and started hitting me with a wooden rod (something of that sort) he was also holding a small knife. He didn't use it but hit me very hard with the rod, punched and kicked.  I'm alive cause I managed to run out of my home and yelled asking for help. Neighbors saved me. He got restrained and brought to the psych ward. 

He had been weird (weirder than usual) for about two weeks, he suddenly wanted to go out  alone (never wanted to before), took extreme care of his looks, slept little and didn't eat much. he was in high spirits tho, I knew something was stranger than usual. He got very distant from me, even talking about taking a break and such. Then 2 days before the attack we actually got very close again, it felt like we met for the 1st time. Then it happened.

I knew that was psychosis but I had no idea what caused it. I thought he was taking hard drugs behind my back, so I looked for them at home. Instead I found some letters he wrote where he detailed his love for a woman who lives nearby. They never had an affair, he would only see her outside as she went in and out of her home. Apparently he had been observing and taking notes about her for 1 year at least. One week before the attack he approached her, but seems she politely declined, but he took it as a maybe. He wrote such words of love, talking to her was the best day of his life. Then I found out that at the same time he would go on socials, save photos of OF or provocative women and leave pornographic comments under their photos. 

He just got diagnosed Bipolar, for the first time in his life. I'm now left a shell of myself, I gave everything I had to this man, I knew he wasn't ok but I had no idea what was the cause of it. I lost a lot of money, self esteem, put aside my life for him basically. He could be the nicest, sweetest most sensitive person, then yell at me for stuff like my weight or him not being able to pursue some hobbies (he could do all he wanted). In general we fought for whatever irritated him.

I'm traumatized for the attack, for the loss, I don't know who I am anymore. I will start therapy in 2 weeks but right now I wonder if I will ever be normal again. Thankfully we never had children.

I'm dreading the legal part of it all, I'm dreading having to empty the house from all his stuff, I'm dreading everything to be honest.  

I don't know how much being bipolar was responsible for the way he behaved, how much can I justify of what he did? I know some about the disorder but not too much, I'm trying to learn. 

Our relationship is obviously done, some moments I feel pity, others  I feel fear, some others I feel nothing. I wonder if someone else went through something similar and might share some insight with me.

2025-08-15 08:00:21;it came out of no where;"Hi friends, it's been a long journey and I just found you all. So bare with me please and my length of post.

  
Names changed for privacy.

Im Michelle and Jason is/was my husband. We had been married almost 15 years, we never really had issues at all until the last 3 years where I kept asking for more emotional support, attention, affection. I was giving and giving and giving in hopes Jason would see how much I really loved and appreciated him even after all these years. Well, 3 days before valentines day he told me he wasn't in love with me anymore and he needed to sleep on the couch, I sobbed and begged him to work on it with me and then he just didnt want to, he also the next day didnt come back home and blocked my calls and yelled at me when he was finally home saying ""I was on the phone talking about you to a friend"" and that night he left..but he stopped by the next day to drop off flowers for me...& then on valentines day this year I found out he not only was having an emotional affair but he cheated on me the day he left to his friends house and said he loved her. He didnt come home leaving me and our kids home alone with no car for an additional 3 days. When he did come home he blamed me for his cheating, blamed me for pushing him, and everything. He told me ""where was this when I needed it"", well I would have offered whatever ""this"" was to him if he told me he wasn't feeling happy. But still till this day doesnt take accountability or apologizes for what he's done..in the last 8 months he would be kind, then cruel, threaten to take child support away and make me truly be a single mom, he only pays the bare minimum I provide everything else for the kids..but yeah its been hard and I know I gave too much grace and too much heart and trust to believe he would change well He started steroids in 2024 July, and he started going to gym and upping his appearance and I never knew that it was a classic sign of cheating I just was being supportive, because for 3 years straight I had been sick from covid, considered a long hauler and also dealt with cancer scares where I had a hysterectomy. I just was being there for him and trying to please him, especially when I felt he was there physically for me during those hard time..we have 2 kids and I really was struggling emotionally with my body changing and no longer being able to have children and on top of this I commuted every other day 1.5hrs one way for our autistic child and oldest child who needed therapy, he wasn't showing up for me like I had hopped he would nor our children because he ""couldnt"" well Jason was the type of guy that if a friend was in need, the friend would always be first, he would always put them first because as a veteran he hated the stigma of 22 a day. So he chose to do all that he could for his friends but couldnt show up for me or his kids emotionally. 

  
One example was, a women about 10 years older than him was really close to him. I told him I wasn't comfortable with it because he has had previous emotional affairs while deployed over 12 years ago and it was really hard on me. Well, even though I did'nt feel comfortable with this he would get angry that I would even suggest it or mention it and he would blow up on me or manipulate me (now I know he would anyway) and I would end up being the ""wrong one"" in the situation. Well this women had a kidney infection and he insisted he needed to go see her before work and he brought her stuff from the local grocery store (she has a husband who doesn't work who could do this) and when he went to talk to her and check on her he stayed for a hour and when he left like actively already on his way to work she calls him and said ""I dont like this water"" like what? & guess what he does? Goes to the store and buys the correct water and drops it off and no she didnt pay for either. 

Anyway, he cheated valentines day this year, 8 months officially today and he has gone back and fourth to want to be with me to not wanting to be with me, to wanting his family and still cheating while ""working it out"" I gave so much grace, and I tired so hard to show him we could work but as soon as I said no I dont want this anymore he cried and said he wanted to make this work. Well I gave him 1 final chance and he refused to do the things I wanted him to do, they were not difficult things, and we had done marriage counseling countless times and now im truly done. I have him blocked on everything even my phone and he spoke to our friend and our friend told him ""if you really want to make it work you would be creative and find a way to talk to her"" I dont want him to, he's hurt me so much...well I feel so much guilt over not wanting to make it work because we have 2 kids that he kicked us out of our home when he kept flipping and I guess I just need to make sure whatever this is im making the right choice..papers have been filed since may, we paused it once and currently now just waiting on him but I thought He truly was my forever until he flipped our life upside down from a Monday to a Tuesday. I feel sadness, hurt, and guilt but I know that I tried everything and got nothing so I know I can walk away knowing I didnt ruin it. I had to rebuild a life for our kids while he didnt care and still doesnt even really call the kids..I never thought I would have chosen this type of man but I also never expected it to implode after 14 years..He has been diagnosed but didnt want to seek help until now. he is BPD with PTSD and also Narcism.

2025-08-15 00:32:22;Bipolar BF Finally Left Me;"Hi guys. I don't even know where to begin. I have been dating this guy with Bipolar Type 2 for 2 years. He told me his diagnosis 2 days in. And I was determined to stick around. He is an amazing person. We have so much in common. It's almost like meeting the male version of myself. Last year, he began to have really bad depressive episodes. The first time it happened, he took back what he said in the beginning about being in love with me.  He said that it had all been a big manic episode after all. That he wasn't in love. It hurt so much I thought things were going to end right then and there. A day later, we decided to keep being ""friends"". I guess you could say we dragged this thing along another year, but in between the depression and the mania, he would tell me that he loved me. It was really confusing. I can't count the number of times he tried to leave me and then came back like nothing happened. Each time he said good bye, it broke a part of me. He would repeatedly tell me that I deserved better, that he wished we met when he wasn't so ill, that he was trying to be a better person but that he's so terrified all the time of hurting me not physically but emotionally. I held on as I loved him truly, hoping that I could be there until he gets better. A few days ago, he told me that he was going to be away for a long time as he needed to work on himself. I haven't heard from him since. This could be the longest time we havent spoken to each other and it's starting to sink in that maybe he means it this time and that I've actually lost him for good. If anyone has been through the same experience, please let me know how you managed to survive this ordeal. It's starting to affect my professional life, and I can't afford that as I deal with life and death matters on a daily basis. Having such emotional tumoil at work is messing my judgement at work so much that I'm considering taking a leave off of work until I'm more emotionally stable.

2025-08-14 23:29:59;My BPSO doesn't believe we have money for anything.;"My SO has always been financially conservative. That was one of the reasons I liked him. He saved, made smart purchases, invested in quality, avoided debt. I felt, as a partner, he wouldn't be a liability, wouldn't go into debt. It was fine for a while but now the pendulum is swinging too far into an obsession. 

The past few years I started seeing the cracks. Our son was born almost 5 years ago and it started with comments about how many Amazon packages we were getting. (Babies need stuff!) During this time I have been the main breadwinner and my husband has been unemployed and managed the household. I don't feel like I spend extravagantly. I buy discount things instead of designer brands. But at the same time, I provide my family with what we need. I buy treats for myself *occasionally* but nothing crazy. 

My husband was diagnosed 2 years ago. Last year I was laid off and we lived off Severance, unemployment,  and dipped into savings, but I recently started a new job and am about a month in. It's going good. It's been a tough year, we've been had to make a lot of sacrifices, but we're getting over the hump. 

Or at least i am. I feel like my husband is stuck in the unemployed mentality and blows up when I spend money on *anything*. For example, my son needs a haircut. Blow up about how much a hair cut costs and he can only get a haircut at the start of the school year. This fall my son is moving from daycare to public pre-k so to help him with the change i bought him a new backpack ($15) and a couple thank you cards for his current teachers. ($12) absolute melt down about how I'm making poor decisions. 

I feel like I'm going crazy!! Am i the bad guy here? I know we have to work on rebuilding our savings but life is going on too. ";r/BipolarSOs;10;13;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mq3wjq/my_bpso_doesnt_believe_we_have_money_for_anything/
2025-08-14 18:56:55;Bipolar Wife in a manic episode;"My wife is Bipolar 1. She told me when we were dating that she was committed before and diagnosed Bipolar 1. While we were engaged she had a manic episode, ran off, started drugs, prostituting and sleeping around, stealing, all sorts of stuff. Eventually she ended up being committed again after police took her to the ER for suicide watch. When she got out we did therapy and reconciled and ended up getting married. She lost her insurance for 2 months and had to stop meds and therapy and when she got it back she didn’t start up again. 10 months into our marriage I started noticing all these little changes starting again and new it was about to happen. We went to the dr and she got a referral for a psych and she started therapy but before she even had her first psych appt I found out she was smoking weed with her sister at our place and we argued and she took off, left our daughter and I, and is now doing the exact same thing. Sleeping around prostituting drugs. I begged her to come home so we could get her help and she won’t because she says it’s all my fault she’s going through this again. My world is shattered right now. I love this woman to death and know this isn’t the real her but my therapist told me I can’t control this. She has to want to be better and stay medicated and it’s her responsibility. 

How likely is it she gets help and stays regimented? Is it worth waiting on her again and praying the cycle doesn’t repeat and I end up with heart break another year from now? 2 years from now? I’m lost. 

Edit - I told her I wanted a divorce shortly after I started 2 weeks ago and she freaked out and said I’m her husband and supposed to be her safe place and said she didn’t want a divorce and she’s just lashing out because she needs her meds. So she knows what’s happening and still hasn’t scheduled a psych appt to get meds. She refuses to come home and admitted she’s been talking to someone because he takes her mind off me and the loss of our family. She hasn’t picked her stuff up either so I take it she intends to come back after she does crash and want things to go back to normal.

2025-08-14 03:00:27;Court Mandates;"Hey all,

I have a general question, to see if anyone has gone to the court to get their SO mandated treatment (US based)? If you have or understand the process, what does it typically entail?

A bit of background, my husband is BP 1 with psychotic features. Since 2023 he's had three manic psychotic episodes. However, he was diagnosed in 2009 with bipolar disorder. He has been involuntarily committed at least three times (two of those since 2023) and overall hospitalized at least 4 times. He never has any awareness or insight during his episodes.

He is currently in  a manic psychotic episode that has been ongoing for about two months. When he is in these episodes he is almost non-functional in his daily life--unable to be a husband, father or provider. He can barely keep appointments and frequently loses track of time. He was arrested about a month ago acting on his delusions. At this point his delusions just seem worse and I do worry about him acting on these delusions now. I'm also very concerned about the money he could potentially spend as he's talked about purchasing a large, expensive SUV and even engagement rings for all the woman he is married to in his delusions. 

He has been resistant to treatment and antipsychotics. I also don't trust him to take his antipsychotics because he has told me multiple times that he would and he has then become ""noncompliant"" each time. 

Any insights to this process would be much appreciated.";r/BipolarSOs;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mpdbg1/court_mandates/
2025-08-13 20:53:19;Mom is diagnosed with Bipolar but she is not taking meds. What to do??;"My\[19F\] mom is in her late 40s. She has been diagnosed with Bipolar Affected Disorder. She had her first episode in 2016. She would get up once in the morning,eat something and then go back to sleep.She would sleep the whole day,wont talk to anyone and wont eat anything except for once in morning.She dropped a lot of weight because of that.She also wasnt aware of her surroundings.If a fire or something would happen she wouldnt know. At that we took her to psychatrist. He gave qutapine 200mg olanzapine 5mg. She took olanzapine for 2 weeks only and quatapine for rest of life.After taking meds she was back to normal in few weeks. at that time doctor did say that her condition will relapse in 5 years. But she took more time than 5 years.

Only from past few years did her symptoms start again. we too her to Psychatrist, psychartist gave her olanzapine again. She will take the olanzapine for a month a so and then she will be fine. but after sometime again the symptoms would start showing up. we again took her to doc,doc gave same medicne. she will take olanzapine for few days maybe few weeks but then she will stop even though the doctor asked her to take. she says she will take only quatapine and thats enough even though doc told her to eat both keep in mind from 2016 to till now she has been taking quatapine100mg(200mg stopped),so we feel maybeee her body has gotten used to it cauz it doesnt seem to affect her anymore. Anwyas we took her to doc many time saying she is not eating her medicine, Doc would explain to her that please take its for her own good. she would start eating and then again after sometimes she will stop. After some visits doc gave her depakine chrono 500mg too. again she will take them for sometime and then stop. as long as she was eating medicine she is fine. Many times she will also not agree to go to doc saying when she wants she will go or she needs.

Eating olanzapine she gains weight and at once point she was overweight,rn a bit better.Another prblm is she never shares anything with us. We tried asking her why she doesnt wanna take meds? is it cauz of side effects?Does she wants to change meds?? but she doesnt says anything and instead says that she is fine and doesnt need meds. Also she thinks she take medicine only because of depression. not BAD or anything.but BAD also contains depression so she is not wrong. Doctor also did say that she hears voices.She also have trouble sleeping .Under one doc notes its written that she is hypomanic and has sleep disorder. other doc note its written as low mood low eneergy fatigue,anhedonia. She has no sucidal thoughts though.From what Ive seen eating depakine and olanzapine, she stays fine.

Also all this aside I just wanna say my mom is amazing. I love her. She never bodyshamed us and she is the reason why I dont struggle much with insecurities.This is a very big deal consedering we are indianss and everyone around me were skinny shaming and she never imposed gender stuffs on me like I need to cook,etc.

This is the background. We are trying to make her uderstand that please eat meds but she doesnt. what to do?? she is also not agreeing to go to doc??please tell me what can I do to help her??I am really sorry for the not so proper background. My english has been goin downhill recently.

2025-08-12 12:25:19;Grieving, Second-Guessing After Leaving My Bipolar Partner;"I just found this group recently, and it's been so validating and encouraging. Thank you to those who have shared your pain so freely.

I started dating my now ex-SO about 15 months ago, and we started hard and fast. Early in the relationship she told me that she had PTSD, and she also mentioned a previous mental health intervention, but she was not diagnosed with bipolar at the time and was instead put on SSRIs for the PTSD. Bipolar wasn't even on the radar. 

A few months in, she got a new job, a big career switch, and we were both ecstatic. Our relationship was also going well, we were super in love and managed her new job's difficult hours with relative ease. Over the next few months she gradually began to get increasingly irritated by her job, stressed by bad customers, stressed by coworkers, second guessing the job switch. 

On my first full week vacation away from her she called me almost every night on her way home from work, each call ending with her crying. I started cutting bits of myself off trying to stabilize her. I lost touch with friends so I could word around her unpredictable days off work. I had always covered the check buying food/drinks, groceries, gifts, tickets, trying to counteract her work stress, but I tried harder. One day I found myself crying while meal prepping breakfast burritos for her so she could have some protein before spending a shift on her feet: I just really hoped that she could get better. Then she asked to talk, and we both decided that it would be best to break up so she could focus on her mental health.

A week later I woke up to her calling. She was crying and begging me to come comfort her, talking about feeling physical pain from her sadness and grief. We talked from 1-4am, about things she was sad about, about how she didn't really want to break up, about how she was worried her parents might have hurt her sister, screaming out her sister's name in the middle of the night. She had gotten off her SSRIs (let her prescription ran out) and then got back on. What followed was a week of intense mania, me trying EVERYTHING in my power to stabilize, but nothing worked. I then had to set boundaries as I wasn't getting sleep, falling short on other commitments, yet she continued to break them.

I eventually enlisted my therapist aunt who convinced me my SO needed help I could not offer, and that me being in the picture might even hamper the process. I told my SO that I needed to step away, for her sake and mine. The next day she was in the hospital, and was diagnosed BP1 with psychosis. She did a week of inpatient followed by a partial hospital program. 

It's been two months since ""hell week"" as I call it. My birthday was last week, and I (stupidly, foolishly, humanly) held hope she'd text. When she did a few days later (she had wanted to make sure she didn't intrude upon my day), it brought up a lot of emotion. I want to reopen the door, but I know she might not be the person I fell in love with. Reading the stories of when a manic episode goes even more off the rails makes me feel like I got lucky, but do I risk an even worse episode further down the line by reopening that door?

Leaving was one of the hardest decisions I've made. I didn't want to, but I know I needed to. How do you deal with the guilt and grief of removing yourself so that they get the help they need? Clearly it worked here since she got treatment, but I still feel robbed of a relationship I didn't want to end. 

* **How do you make peace with choosing health for someone else, especially when part of you still wants to be with them?** 
* **Have you ever reconnected after they stabilized?** 
* **How do you balance wanting to know how they're doing while protecting your own mental health?**";r/BipolarSOs;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mnz3x8/grieving_secondguessing_after_leaving_my_bipolar/

2025-08-12 09:44:56;Have you taken medication yourself not as the Bipolar SO?;"My SO was diagnosed with bipolar II in the past year. It’s been a long road of trying to help them get treatment. They are against any sort of mental health medication and self medicate with marijuana, nicotine, and adderall. After a really low episode a few months ago they finally agreed to try medication.

Their doctor started them on a low dose to see how they reacted to it and after a month or two raised the amount. They took the full amount for about a month and then never refilled the prescription. Throughout this time I’ve found out a lot of things they were hiding from me. They deny everything and I feel like I’m stuck. The cycles of highs and lows are getting shorter and shorter. It went from a couple weeks at a time to everyday.

I just feel like I’m trying so hard to hold on to my SO and doing everything I can think of to support them but no matter what I do they are slipping away. It’s leaving me feeling really hopeless about the future. My whole life is consumed replaying moments of things they’ve said or done, how to get them help, how to approach them, what else are they hiding from me, etc…

Have any of you ever tried medication for yourself to help with depression and anxiety that comes from dealing with your bipolar SO? I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety since I was young. But I always felt like will medication/therapy even help when my circumstances will remain the same? Will it help me deal with my circumstances in a more positive way?

2025-08-11 08:40:48;mania and discard;"He (M25) spent all of his money to go see a friend in a different state and is now in Japan. 

Which is funny because we were supposed to go together. 

I (also M25) don’t think he’s seeking therapy or taking medication, he’s back living with his parents in Canada  and I guarantee they don’t care about him or what he’s doing. I’m in the U.S. so we’re long distance, even though he was supposed to move in in March of this year and even came here and started the process and ended up having to go home for a family emergency and never came back (even tho a lot of his stuff is here). We made all of these plans before his episode started and talked through it reasonably so it wasn’t mania, an episode is what made him back out of it. 

He is newly diagnosed as he started showing major symptoms this past year. 

I feel so helpless because I think this is his first extreme episode that’s lasted for months. Since around November. 

I can’t do anything. He won’t let me help and I just have to watch him crash. No one around him will listen to me. He blocked me on everything now. 

I miss him so much. I don’t recognize him anymore. I know in a few years maybe it’ll catch up to him and he’ll get treatment but I won’t be around to see it. I just want the best for him. I knew he was getting a large amount of money and I encouraged him before he discarded me to put a limit on it each day and try to save it. I just had this gut feeling it was going to get blown. And of course I was right. 

And of course, I feel selfish because I wish he would’ve used it to see me. I’m dying and have cancer and it sucks dealing with this but I don’t want to love anyone else. I don’t have a lot of time left and just seeing him distance from good friends and spend money and not work and not medicated feels so overwhelming. I won’t be here much longer to help through anything. I don’t get that closure I need that he’ll be okay. 

I’m just venting I guess because I just am overwhelmed with so much emotion and don’t even know if I’m making sense. I hate this disorder sometimes and what it takes from people.

2025-08-10 08:48:19;"Need help; should I tell my 11yo about my bipolar 2 spouse?";"For context, my spouse was diagnosed very late in life (at 58). We had been together/married since he was 40 (he did not show signs until after our daughter ws born). We have an 11yo daughter. His diagnosis was 5 years ago and he was hospitalized at that time due to a catatonic depression. Our daughter was young enough not to question why daddy was in the hospital at that time. Since leaving the hospital he has stabilized and on meds.

He has had a hypomania period 2 years ago that stabilized with meds, no alcohol, and sleep. He is currently in a hypomania period that is going on 4 months and he is very aggressive, has no tolerance, leaves the house for extended periods of time, and is absent from the family life our daughter is used to. He doesn’t eat dinner with us, he doesn’t read to her at night anymore, and he leaves without telling her he’s going to be gone. He rarely tells me.

I am committed to our marriage and am learning how to communicate more effectively with an avoidant partner experiencing hypomania but I am not sure what to tell our daughter. Unlike the past episodes where she didn’t realize the impact of his absence, this time she asks why he’s mad all the time. Asks where is he and when is he coming home. Asks why he’s cussing so much.

Does anyone have experience as a parent and what they share with an 11yo? I want to tell her but fear that it will make her more anxious in the future around his moods and may do more harm than good. But if I don’t tell her she may continue to question what’s happening and that could have a negative long term affect on her too. I know kids are resilient and can handle more than we think.

2025-08-07 01:27:56;Frustrating;"My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with bad paranoid schizophrenia. I was stuck in the same place due to mania, and just had got my diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there. I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me. I was only 18 at the time—taken in on a stretcher. Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated.

My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus. Left me beyond frustrated.

He was drifting from his wife and would go on and on about intending to leave her. Felt he was spied and plotted against by her. So we were both frustrated with being there.

The toilets were special. They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pills—it helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications.

He had tried to flush his wedding wing down the toilet but he did not realize it didn’t flush. I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring. I told him. He took it out. He found it to be a sign form God that he is to stay with his wife, and there was immense happiness in his eyes.";r/bipolarart;4;1;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1mjaybf/frustrating/
2025-07-10 05:11:33;Not everything they do is “just the illness”  sometimes it’s abuse in disguise.;"**Trigger warning:** Mentions of emotional abuse, panic attacks, gaslighting, psychiatric hospitalization, filmed without consent, trauma.

For two years, I was involved with someone diagnosed with bipolar type 2. I helped him find a psychiatrist, supported him through the diagnosis, arranged his meds weekly (because otherwise he wouldn’t take them), and tolerated erratic behavior under the banner of “he’s sick, he needs support.”  
The relationship was a rollercoaster, but not the romantic kind. He could be sweet and present one moment, then distant, degrading, or passive-aggressive the next. He played games with jealousy, used women around him to provoke reactions, and when I called it out, I was “too sensitive.” I kept telling myself: *he’s struggling with a serious illness, he doesn’t mean it*. But deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.  
Before a multi-day event we were supposed to attend, he was clearly hypomanic: overspending, arrogant, erratic, impulsive. I told him I wouldn’t go unless we discussed what was going on. He ignored it. I reminded him he was running out of medication. He didn’t care. I packed everything. I planned. I carried all the weight.

At the event, he humiliated me. Mocked me in front of friends. Was cold, condescending, flirted openly. Then he disappeared for hours. When I found him again, something was off , body language, alcohol that wasn’t ours, a button missing on his pants. I asked questions. He rolled his eyes. I exploded.  
When we got home, I collapsed. Literally. I had a full-blown panic attack, no sleep, no food, no control over my body. My nervous system crashed. Instead of helping, he called an ambulance and **secretly filmed me** under heavy medication in the hospital. Later, he claimed I had a *psychosis* even though medical reports confirmed; **no psychosis, no loss of reality, just an emotional and physical breakdown** triggered by prolonged stress and trauma.

# The aftermath

In the days after, I tried to talk. To repair. I owned my rage. I acknowledged where I lost control. I apologized. But he never did. He coldly framed me as unstable, blamed *everything* on me, and hinted to others that I was dangerous.  
He minimized what he did. Denied his part.  
He pushed buttons *on purpose,* then acted like my pain was evidence that I was crazy.

That’s when I realized:  
Yes, he was in a hypomanic state.  
Yes, mental illness played a role.  
**But no: this was not just bipolar. This was conscious cruelty, masked as crisis.**  
He remembered exactly what to say to cut deep.  
He knew what to deny, what to twist, when to play the victim.  
That’s not illness. That’s manipulation.

# And me?

The year after has been brutal. I’ve had nightmares, panic attacks, trouble trusting myself. I kept asking: *Was I abusive? Did I overreact?*  
I isolated. I lost friends. I questioned everything.  
But therapy helped me name it; **I was gaslit, emotionally destabilized, and pushed until I snapped and then blamed for snapping.**  
He used his illness as a shield. And my empathy as a weapon against me.

If you're in a relationship with someone who’s bipolar and you find yourself excusing patterns of humiliation, emotional whiplash, gaslighting, and boundary-crossing **pause**.  
Mental illness explains behavior, but it doesn’t erase accountability.  
You can care deeply for someone and still admit; *this is destroying me*.  
If you’re there, I see you. You’re not weak. You’re not crazy.  
You’re just someone who stayed too long because you believed love could fix what only responsibility and treatment ever could.

2025-07-04 07:59:27;Napalm;"  

Part 1

It felt frustrating in Chongqing. I was rather stuck in Hechuan. I got accustomed to lajio (spice) there. I was a Midwesterner at the age of 22. I was raised in Illinois. I became a manic—a Ferris wheel on fire—I was hiding under a bed in a hotel. Bold like napalm. Sometimes I can never stop. Even when I was 18 in a ward arguing with staff. Always want to fight things. That’s why I refused the meds and went on a plane from America to China. I was going to be an English teacher. And like a light switch, the change and SSRIs turned me into a mess. It would be my first time experiencing psychosis. My biggest issue. I never imagined I would be stuck illegally in a country suffering psychotic episode in my early twenties.

Transplanted as pollen. I was left with a backpack and a cellphone. With a downloaded app called WeChat. I had arrogantly quit a university job in a fit. Spent the past months full of energy and not sleeping and neglecting myself, including eating, to work on a novel. Not considering myself religious I had obsessed over occult ideas. Spending nights reading Aleister Crowley—haven taken a rusty pocket knife to carve a pentagram on my chest for spiritual protection.

I did not have funds to fly home. My visa was connected to my previous job, which meant I had now made it void. 

The thin nifty about WeChat as a messaging app, it allows users to find people near them that are also looking for others. It was like a virtual pond. All kinds of people, including sex workers trying to make things happen. 

It could with luck be used to find people looking for people in terms of other kinds of work. It was helpful on many occasions for finding gigs working at English training schools and also finding work as a private tutor for people. 

Mania makes me irritable. Enough to tell a boss to fuck off. Thoughts ricochet within me. Bumper cars collide. 

Being stuck and angry sucks. I scrolled and scrolled on a Huawei phone. 

Absolutely pissed off this world.

Pissed at the times police wanted to take me away for being a mess.

Sometimes women get pissed. Scrolling through their phones. Angry at their cheating husbands. It really is not that hard to have flair—be a damn white oddity. Like moths to a porchlight. Particles of sand through hands. This is when I first started the habit of it…

Rather go by a rather empty name of Taishen… with further explanation needed but now is not convenient. But I assure it is interesting enough and has some importance.

Habits are various in nature in how they attach to and eat at marrow—like atom bombs flashing as rays evaporate DNA—set on less than human in the cage of bad things taken up—my time as a former heroin addict is left as stretch marks on me in various ways. The same goes for the first time I found myself making arrangements with middle aged married women while desperation of waves whiplashed me like sandpaper hands coming at me to leave me in a tiring state of abrasion. 

I had spent a night snuck away into a hotel. Found someone on a business trip. Instead of registering I waited to sneak along in the hotel elevator amongst a group of others, as I had no card. I head to a designated room number. Originally I was sitting in a park. Playing on WeChat found someone in their mid-thirties. Pictures were exchanged and I said no. She brought up paying for the hotel if I arrived. Things were agreed. 

When I met I washed up after her and we used our phones to awkwardly translate what we would do.

Room service knocked. I found myself hidden under a bed as I was not registered to be there.

It seems unusual that it was around this time I had started working on a story of my life as a heroin addict when I got caught up in my worse manic episode at 22. Finished half that work before never going back to it after my manic episode had ended. Now I am here writing about it and wondering if the same can happen again in the process of this work. 

It feels extremely cliché I would write a novel about struggles with heroin addiction. It has been done many times

I feel like my thoughts are bit off. I left the hotel the next morning with the little money I did have on a debit card. Turns out the woman was from Taiyuan. It is a city in the northern part of China in the province of Shanxi—coal country with the worst air pollution China. 

Turns out has a colleague in a Taiyuan that takes courses at an English training center.  I was able to contact this place in the morning via a shared contact on WeChat given to me. 

Before I knew it I was sending my information and documents in my backpack at an internet café to fax. It would land me a job that day that would help me out a lot in my situation. Things turned quite out as I expected though. I was shifted like a ball to somebody else to contact for a training center geared to teaching children. 

I took what I had and ran off to a train station after taking the public transit. Unfortunately I was shit for money and could not afford a high speed rail pass. The slow train would take thirty two hours to get to my destination. I would have taken a room with a bed but all I could afford was a hard seat for the travel. 

Things were getting better for me in the circumstance considering I had found someone willing to take me for work despite my visa situation. 

The 32 hour tain ride was horrendous in some ways, but mostly I was in excitement despite the circumstances. I’m always giddy when disappointed. I moved up and down the aisle of the train. I could not speak mandarin, but it did not stop me from trying to interact with everyone. I talked many ears off during the train ride. I went up and down the aisle trying to interact as a moth to a porchlights—I could not stop even if I had wanted to. I found great enjoyment the times I did get to sit across a table from somebody my age heading to Taiyuan from Chongqing. They were a university student returning to their hometown. Another passenger was an elderly man with hard boiled eggs, he was eating one after another one. I highly enjoyed each and every conversation that I had. It was like my head was a lightbulb wanting June bugs to bang against it with the intensity of Roman candles shot at my on going mouth of nicotine tinged teeth. 

“If you find someone in Shanxi it is practice to pay the family money before you can get married. You would also have to already own a home and a car,” told my across seat university passenger friend named David. 

“Not necessarily what I was looking for. When is the next stop for snacks?” When the train stops I am able to get out and to have a walk onto the platform to buy various goods from the platform to take back with me to eat along the ride to Taiyuan. 

I had all my important documents tucked in my bag. This included my health clearance and obviously I made no mention of my mental health diagnosis or history to the doctor who had to evaluate me. My diploma and TEFL certificate were tucked away securely. A TEFL is a certificate that stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, it qualifies m to teach English as a second language abroad—it had only took a few months of taking a course I paid for online to obtain it. 

It is easy to live a happy life when you can deceive yourself. Mania can make you deceive yourself. One can be doused in napalm and still not fully recognize what is actually going on. Same goes the flicking of psychosis. Even when I have nothing I find myself in my radiating irritation the most qualified of things—the velocity of my rhythm sets me out of an orbit.

The pressure cooker keeps me moving like a propeller at times. I finally arrived at Taiyuan. I arrived at the station to be greeted by Ryan my manager and his assistant Jennifer. We had our hello and introduction and they helped me get to a taxi that would bring me to my new apartment. I finally had a residence again. Apparently they were desperate for a teacher. The last teacher was from New Mexico and apparently they pulled a midnight run—that is when a teacher in the middle of the night disappears onto a plane back home without any notification of it. 

The apartment was okay. On the fourth floor with no elevator, so it was a bit of a climb up a dark stairwell not lit correctly. 

My job was a training center that had a location near Yingze park in the city of the city. I would assist in teaching kindergarten to high school aged students there in private lessons paid by their parents. I would also be assigned by my company to various primary schools in the city. I would take public buses to various schools paid by the company I worked for to give English lessons as a bounced around to various classrooms and schools in the city. 

A taxi ride would always be a thrill. Caused me nerves at first, but I came to love the flying in dangerous ways along a road. I remember a driver beeping their horn away as they drone onto the sidewalk to pass people. They treated the pedestrians as if they were in the wrong. I came flying in front of a primary school at its front gates. I was going to start teaching a first grade classroom an a kindergarten classroom. The way schools are set up is with a wall around the etriely of the exterior of the school. There is a gate at the front where  one or two security will be atwait to let people in and out of the complex of the school. 

I walked in front of the gate to greet the security. I was my first time with an assignment at this school. The guard said they had never seen me before and wouldn’t let me in. Not  a big nuisance while I called my boss who then called the school to sort out the situation.

I miss the classroom so much. I ended up teaching in China for five years at various training schools. After retuning to Illinois, I still taught as a primary school teacher in a public school. 

I often feel extremely ugly from inside to my outside, but something is attractive there.  This does not come just in terms of flirting and relationships—mania makes me a genuine lightbulb that flickers in a way that encourages the insects to me—everyone looks like a June bug—this is what I have come to understand about life. But that ugly does kind of stay like rot in a cavity that leaves a bad taste in the mouth that smells foul—hoping nobody catches the smell near me—it must tie into my struggles with bulimia over the years. 

The same goes for my years as a teacher—in relation to the whole lightbulb effect—I\\m positive it is tied to mania and hypomania. The younger students always were fixated on the information I was teaching to them. I kept over the years methods taught to me and self-taught that I found extremely effective with younger students when it comes to teaching. 

Everything was physical in learning in terms of intensity and ambition. When teaching my first grade classroom I would create flashcards for the vocab we would work on and implement in creating new sentences with. We would chant these words together in a way that made me a clown while teaching. Students would yell out the word that I presented with intense enthusiasm. As I walked by students it was expected that while they yelled out the word they would also physically hit the card. Later I would also work on physical gestures and acting out of vocab words and they would follow the actions and phrases along with. 

I would often eventually turn the class into two teams. When students got an answer right I would behave comically and full of energy—I would give them a high five and pretend they were so strong with it that it hurt y hand in the process with much exaggeration—the students always seemed to never get tired of this act. 

One game I would pay involved drawing two stick figures with happy faces on them. Each figure would represent one of the teams for the classroom. I would draw a hungry alligator under the figures. Their faces would also be comical in appearance and full of exaggerations. Each figure had a parachute placed over them and four strings attached. During the game the students would race to say the word correctly represented on the flashcard of the correct word for the gesture I was making. The team that was not the slowest would lose a string on the parachute. If a team lost all four strings as they would fall to the alligator who would eat them. The students found it hilarious with my actions involved in it. I would also draw tears and a person praying to represent anticipation and worry of falling down each time they lost a string. 

I had a tooth game too. I would draw too large faces for each time. The team that could answer the flashcards and gestures the quickest would have a tooth drawn in their mouth. The team with the most teeth would win and it would look rather funny as the mouth grew and grew with an abnormal and extreme amount of teeth. 

I often did other physical and interactive games like having students run to the word I showed a card to or gestured—each word would be attached to a point in the classroom on a wall. 

I know it sounds grandiose, but the parents always seemed to think I was great at my job. 

The word vulnerable means so many things to me. That word is like the coal to form the generator that makes the guides for the ethics I follow in my life—I hold very strongly to these values that I hold and have developed on how to live—I can express it more later but I greatly attach a kind of Christian value system to it, which makes sense considering I was raided in a Lutheran household and always went to church, Sunday school, and went to my courses and went through my confirmation—everyone is a bit of a mop—some pick up clean water and others dirty or a mix of it--waiting to fine the people to drain them voluntarily or involuntarily. I was born vulnerable. I walked pigeon-toed and grew up tripping on my feet—I speak with a soft feminine voice. Bipolar disorder makes somebody vulnerable. I have almost a sense of us vs them—the vulnerable and those that harm the vulnerable—take advantage of the vulnerable—I feel this is a very much Christian in the idea of the unfortunate are more holy than the rest of the bunch—children are like that in terms of being born into a cruel existence—a cruel existence I felt at times in my life and so many do—making sure harm does not come to those in need give the light of purpose to go bright inside like a Christmas tree in my brain—this light of happiness and warmth. I never expected I would fall in love for teaching due to the antidepressant effect provided. It would become my career for a decade.

Some grow up wanting to be a teacher, I became one by accident, desperation, and being saved. 

Sometimes I inflate on self-hate like a helium balloon that needs to be tied to a wrist. The vulnerability equation is imprinted on my brain. 

In my early teens I started struggling with bulimia and image. I remember when my mother caught me in the act. I was not offered help but criticized. I was called a girl for my problems and threatened to be taken to somewhere to be fixed with my confusion. I don’t identify as transgender. I identify as a man that struggles with bulimia and happens to have feminine qualities.

I attribute it to circumstances that happened to me.

After long day of work I did what my young self often did. I went clubbing with friends. I feel like even if I had aspects of myself such as being bisexual feelings, people can spot it regardless. I’m extremely secretive about it and not comfortable displaying that vulnerable aspect of myself.

My friend from England went with me. He was about six years my senior. Big guy. Tall. The clubs name was Maoye. 

I always enjoyed the free drinks available to foreigners—it was done to attract Chinese clients, as the idea was foreigners being there would attract people. 

Amongst the hot and sweltering crowd a man grabbed ahold of. I felt stuck. I was taken off guard. Pushed and cornered. While on me I managed to push him off. But it all serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of my life.

A nail was placed into my hand—a constant burn and reminder of that vulnerability. 

Part 2

From self-hate I can also be so grandiose. I am like a Christmas tree that is lit up. Sparkers so pretty that you cannot let go of them, even if it burns your fingertips and hurts. 

From heroin to sex, you can smother the pain. You drain the ocean to fill a void in these times. It ties to mania as well. That restlessness and irritability is extinguished by the paradox of throwing kerosene to everything burning. I’m so grandiose t hide my insecurities, I mistake my misfortune as a mark of something ugly virtuous—the neon of vulnerability pulsating like a star within me. Swelling on a pain. 

Bad habits. I want you to judge me and tell me what’s wrong with me. Give me a verdict. 

Stress a trigger for mania, and I was stressed from the incident I had experienced at the club. I bloated like a tick to distract from locusts of thoughts that could not shut up with their commotion. 

I had been sleeping around more than before. My brain was Christmas tree lights. I accelerated on a generator—I made a mixed episode worse. 

Tease a disaster when you heightened like a blimp. Full of hydrogen. Hoping to burn up ad rain down like napalm. 

When the pretty candles on the Christmas tree are left untouched—not looked at like a kettle on burner that has been forgotten—the dry neglected tree when into a house fire. 

I’ve had four attempts in my life so far. 

When I attempt I don’t cry for help. I feel too vulnerable.

Hate police and wards. 

Downing pills.

My past failed attempts made me aware of everything done wrong before. The sleeping pills alone might do wat I was looking for at that time. I bought an electrical cable. This way if it failed I would still be unconscious and choked out by the cord—fail safe plan to end my life. 

The words coming out of my mouth slowed down. I started getting second thoughts. Stuck my face towards the toilet bowl while on my knees. Sticking my fingers down my throat. Leaving blood vessels bursting in my eyes. 

Went stumbling outside and waved a taxi down and asked to be taken to the local hospital. 

Never expected finding myself checked into a psych ward in a foreign country. 

Nietzsche has a quote in reference to chaos in life and how it is needed to create a star—this reference holds so much value to me. Sometimes stars hit together just right to create fate out of the worst of things. The ward lead me to meet the woman made of paper. She would one day become my wife. I would have children with her. Forge together as soldiers to face the obstacles in life. Someone who would save my life during a future attempt when I was found unconscious from an overdose. The smartest and toughest woman I have ever known. 

I liked it when she stuck that needle in me for an IV. It must correlate to be a heroin addict. The pushing of something in my vein correlates to happiness ad purity.

The woman made out of paper was my nurse in the ward I was stuck in. What attracted her to the mess that is me I will never understand fully.

The woman made out of paper is named Lilu. She was one year older than me and one of my nurses at that ward. She was from Zhengzhou—a city in the province of Henan that is based in the center of China. I am sure as the reader it would be nice to know why I call her the woman made of paper. 

She struggled with her own demons. She also deserves much praise for her resilience and brains. When she was born she was raised by a family that adopted her and often neglected and abused her growing up. Her biological family is distant from her, even though she has an identical twin—they felt too poor to take care of her and made the choice they needed to be less of one child as she also has an older sister—her twin got to stay with that family but she was given up and adopted. I am sure this must bother her even if she never will talk about it to anyone in her life—as she is one to refuse ever discussing emotions and feelings, as this is not her personality type—she is very much a fighter. I think most would struggle with wondering why they were the one let go of—it also must hurt her knowing that the family would have a son and keep him. 

Despite all these circumstances, she graduated top of her class of four thousand students—Chinese high schools can be quite large—they often serve as boarding schools. She was a smart and hardworking student. Circumstances never made her stop trying to be the best and moving forward and she never made excuses for herself. In university she also did well and got accepted at the most studious and hard to obtain a position for at the number one hospital in Shanxi.

I have already ranted and gone on about my affection and feelings tied to heroin. Drinking of entire oceans to fill voids. 

Paper is a void. It asks for calligraphy to be written on it to make braille. This way when fingers run over skin, it tells worth—the reason for troubles—it forms connection through those words of declaration—the whining for why things are the way they are—the filling of a void like a heroin addict needing a cure—two papers come together to write upon one another—as a paper I am her typo—I stand as a falling mess with nerves like tripwire, I keep failing and losing my composer, while she stands stronger as a declaration that has been written on—when I was chased I listened to her and joined as one. I wish and intend to always serve the woman made out of paper who has saved my life and always been there for me, being so strong despite circumstances—amongst the wind of turmoil in life I follow along her path. 

It was love at first sight for her but not for me. I had no interest in dating her at the time. I worked across the street of that hospital in a office building for a training center as a part time job. I would teach adults English who paid for private lessons near to Yingtze park in the center of Taiyuan. She signed up for classes for me to teacher her and brought me food on almost every other day that she had prepared to try win me over. This continued for a year until I agreed to start dating her. 

All of these conditions would lead to marriage and two daughters. 

In a pit. I get to burn as paper amongst paper.  Eternally. With a life that will keep reoccurring.  ";r/bipolarart;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1lr4pdh/napalm/
2025-07-04 00:14:04;Bipolar perspective;"Hi, I recently found out about this sub and reading the posts here has been horrifying for me. 

So... I'm bipolar, diagnosed few years ago.

And from the bottom of my heart I wanted to tell you that not all of us are the same. Just because your partner was diagnosed doesn't mean they will change. The only difference is that they can now start some sort of treatment and be aware of what is happening to them. 

In fact anyone that weaponises bipolar disorder to justify abusing you and expecting your unconditional forgiveness and pity is a manipulative asshole. I strongly believe that. 

Yes, many of us have good and bad days. Yes, many of us are more prone than a regular person to doing things we later regret. Yes, it's good to support your partner when they are having a rough patch. 

But your partner's disorder cannot dominate your life. Do not suffer abuse or harassment, just because you think ""you should understand"". No, abuse is abuse and consequences are real. 

There is a line and if you feel your boundaries have been crossed, don't just suffer in silence.

If you have any questions about bipolar and want a slightly biased opinion please feel free to ask me. No judgement.";r/BipolarSOs;115;95;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1lqtmto/bipolar_perspective/

Delusions, psychosis, infidelity, and hallucinations, with some scary things sprinkled in there. The whole deal. He spent over 2 months in psychiatric hospitals (involuntary). He was diagnosed Bipolar affective with Psychosis. (After a life time diagnosis of ADHD fueled by Adderall). In the hospital they figured out the right medication plan for him (10 different prescriptions daily) and recommended therapy for him and us. 

He has now been home 3 months, 100% med compliant, going to therapy and accepting of his new diagnosis. His mood has been stable, and he says for the first time in his life his head is “quiet”. 

With all this to say, hang in there. Early this year when we were going through everything, I had zero hope. I never expected that things could turn out the way they currently are.

2025-05-01 23:41:15;I AM A DOCTOR!!!!;"I AM A DOCTOR!!!!

I graduated medical school today and have the “,MD” next to my name that I dreamed of since I knew what it meant. I hope this does not come off as bragging but I thought if any group of people would understand how impossible this felt I thought it would be this one. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2018 but I cant remember a time I wasn’t depressed or hypomanic. I initially didn't think I would live past 12 then 16 then 18 then 19 then 20 and today I am near perfectly medicated (a few weeks of hypomania and depression slipped through). This dream felt unattainable as I lived my life since 12 as a depressed zombie or a hypomanic zombie. I am incredibly lucky. With the help of my incredible husband (who I’ve been with since I was 14), I got psychiatric help, started/stopped/switched medication, and am now living the life I was too scared to dream of. I’ve cried so many times thinking about everything I would have missed out on if I ended it all. I’ve cried so much thinking about how horrible of a person I was to the most important people in my life. I’ve cried so much thinking about how I didn’t know what normal felt like for most of my life. I feel a normal amount of happy and safe from my mind. I know this is a chronic condition so I know I'm not ever out of the woods but I am so fucking proud to have achieved this goal. 

Key take aways for myself: 1) medication works for treatment not a cure 2) be patient and hang on until something works 3) be so grateful for every support person or any win no matter how little 4) a psychiatric condition is not an excuse to be an asshole  ";r/bipolar2;1327;139;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1kcbut3/i_am_a_doctor/

2025-03-11 03:34:49;Writing the post I wish someone had written for me;"This is the post I wish I had read a long time ago. Not one topic, but all of them. I have been through it, and there is so much shame around sharing what happens in intimate relationships. I’m here to say that talking about it heals. So I am sharing some of my experience (40F) here since I really value this sub, and found it after my husband (42M) with Bipolar 1 was hospitalized. I think I was living in lala love bombing land for quite some time before his diagnosis, and when I finally woke up, and was ready to onboard what was happening, this place made me feel seen like never before. This is all written after 6 weeks with almost no contact and a lot of therapy. 

1.  The most important thing I can say is, chances are, if you are reading this as a bipolarSO, you are a very high functioning and empathetic partner, and those things should not to be used against you. If your partner doesn’t want to take any responsibility for their actions, the things they say, or the part they play in their own misery (and yours), it’s time to set a timer on your patience and start asking yourself some tough questions.


2. Get curious and don't believe everything your partner says, the more you know, the more prepared you will be to navigate this. I had no idea what bipolar disorder was until I saw that my husband had been prescribed Abilify. I looked up the med because when I asked him why he wasn’t taking those pills, but was taking all his others, he said it was because he wanted to see if the other ones (all non-benzo anti anxiety meds) would help first. He had previously involved me in all phone calls, pill regimens, and scheduling for his mental health issues - which we thought were depression, service-related PTSD, ADHD and unhealed childhood sexual abuse and trauma. So I did some digging and that’s when I saw what Abilify was used for, and I encountered the list of symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. I started a note in my phone to document what I was noticing. This situation was the first sign that my seemingly open husband was hiding things from me. Turns out he had been diagnosed with a moderate mood disorder after what I now know was rapid cycling bipolar disorder over the holidays. I was so happy he had called his provider, unprompted, to address the issues he was having. It made me feel good that he was self-reflecting and trying to get better. What I had a problem with was his behavior around deciding not to take the meds, and still expecting me to be responsible for his care without having the whole picture. His decision to not take those meds started off a chain of events that led to unchecked mania, a bipolar 1 diagnosis within a month, psychosis and ultimately a 5150.


3. When I read the symptoms of bipolar disorder I still felt like it wasn’t clear to me that he had it.  There is a distinct lack of material showing real examples of bipolar symptoms.  Every person is unique, but here are some examples from my lived experience that I wish I had known about earlier:

·      Hypersexuality: Not wanting or needing your active participation in a sexual encounter, or fetishizing you not wanting sex, or enjoying that you are ignoring but still allowing them to do what they want. Sudden or increased interest in polyamory, swinging, multiple sexual partners, questions about sexuality, oversexualizing you, people on tv, the person in the grocery store. Extreme and ever evolving fetishes. What worked before doesn’t work anymore. When manic my husband would masturbate for hours and could not orgasm with me or with himself, he would go on dating apps and escort sites for hours, he cheated on me with men all while maintaining he wasn’t attracted to cis men. It was compulsive, compartmentalized and out of control. When I reflected it back to him, he would acknowledge the behavior wasn’t normal, but then go right back to it. He sexually assaulted me multiple times at the end.  When confronted he turned all the attention on him and overdosed right after. He sent pictures of my face and my body to random people on the internet soliciting sex. Eventually all conversation about friends became about sex, their sexuality, and whether they were good in bed or attractive. We lived with my mom and he had a really great relationship with her, very genuine and very appropriate.  Then he dry humped my leg after I got a new haircut, grabbed my crotch in a dress, all in front of her. When depressed he had no sex drive whatsoever. When baseline, our sex life was fantastically fun and mutually fulfilling.

·      Impulsive and Risky Behavior: Buying multiples of an item you only need one of, like burritos or types of guitar strings, or headphones. Buying a new car and then the next day doing drugs and driving to therapy only to pass out in the chair and have his therapist call 911. Rock climbing without safety gear. Forging government documents. Hoarding money - He hid cash from me in the house and made sure all of his money stayed in his bank account, including rent/deposit/insurance money from the property we owned, all while I paid all the bills and the mortgage.  (This is called Financial Abuse btw, look it up). 

·      Irritability: The sound of the hold music from the psychiatrist office would make him scream, the lights on the gazebo would make him leave mid-conversation. A normal talk at dinner would be turned into a personal attack on him. Before diagnosis I never knew what version of him was going to wake up.  I walked around on eggshells. After diagnosis I called 3-8pm the witching hour because the meds were wearing off and it wasn’t time for the next ones, and who knew what he was going to be up to.

·      Lack of sleep: Not sleeping makes mania worse.  Your body stops producing GABA when it doesn’t sleep, and when you don’t have GABA you are anxious and can’t relax.  It’s a vicious cycle.  Not sleeping for days, or needing very little sleep.  Any shift in our sleep schedule like clocks changing, seasons changing, or the routine with my new job hit him like a ton of bricks. Waking up at 3am like a perimenopausal woman and then never going back to sleep (working up to mania). When depression hit he would sleep for 12-14 hours a day and do literally nothing and need a nap.

·      Grandiosity: My opinion no longer counted, my thoughts didn’t matter. I was solely there to support him in his greatness. Even if it broke me. He was the supreme leader of his little world, and could definitely be the leader of the world at some point. His music was better than everyone else’s (he was extremely talented, can’t lie), his inventions were going to change the world and I should write it all down and organize how to execute on it.  Constant need for praise and admiration with none given.  Original compliments to me were now character traits of his: When we first got married he walked around saying he married up, now every other day it was that we both married up. I was so emotionally intelligent and so good with people, now he was just as adept at conversations and building social capital.  He forwarded all my texts to his phone, and had all my contacts in there as well. This is all just text book NPD as well.  I do believe he may have a cluster B in addition to Bipolar but I’ll probably never know.

·      Racing thoughts and speech: Incessant need to optimize everything and do it in a better way than before. Simple tasks like making coffee were now astrophysics and he would sit there telling me how he was taking so long because he was having so many great ideas about how to improve the process. Every thought required acknowledgement from him and from me. Everything should be recorded for posterity.  All tv and movies must be paused and rewound over and over so that all elements could be considered and spoken about. During my requested quiet time he would text me incessantly. He would bust in during my meetings while I worked from home. He would wake me up to tell me things, when I was the only one who had a job to get to in the morning.

·      Delusions: Things may seem funny or creative, sometimes it feels like you are just living with someone who sees the world so differently and it’s cool. He smelled things that weren’t there (and I have the best nose on the planet so I know it wasn’t there), thought that one of our dogs who didn’t like him worked for the government and was spying on him which was hilarious until I realized he actually thought that.  He put leftover pizza in the junk drawer of the kitchen, and stored his keys in the fridge. By the end he had turned all his paranoia on me, and was convinced that I was out to get him (look up dysphoric mania, it’s not all euphoric all the time).  There was a baseball bat, a death planner in his amazon cart and plans to leave me involved.

·      Self-harm:  My husband was never actively suicidal.  He just did everything in his life to slowly or indirectly kill himself.  He put himself in very risky situations with sexual partners, he constantly hurt himself and broke or destroyed things, and he did so many drugs that he stopped breathing many times.  Cracked teeth, head injuries, broken pots, expensive items left out in the rain or left to be eaten by the dogs. Before I met him he would get in fights, injure himself, and wander into the wilderness without gear. I spent the last 3 months of our marriage just trying to keep him alive.  So when he said I’m not suicidal, the evidence was to the contrary.


4. Psychiatrists and psychologists only know what the patients tell them. They get one hour with someone who may or may not be trying to mask their symptoms. Or who may be manic and not aware, or depressed and just think they are like everyone else who is struggling. Or at baseline and asymptomatic by the time the appointment comes. One of the unique traits of bipolar disorder is the person being unable or having great difficulty reflecting on their current emotional or physical state. Most of us struggle with this because of cultural or familial conditioning, but an example is my husband had three emotions he would go to: Happy, Angry, Empty. When probed, or presented with a feelings wheel, he could literally never get past those words. It doesn’t always occur to the person that they aren’t sleeping and this is a bad thing, or that their incredible flight of ideas, is just that, or even that their rapid 180 degree mood change is not what other people experience. We all experience these things from time to time, it’s the extreme nature of what someone with bipolar disorder experiences that makes up the diagnosis. I say all of this because I wanted to be involved, but the first time I was in front of a psychiatrist and my husband was hypomanic, but I didn’t even have that word in my vocabulary yet, I really struggled to say what I was seeing. I doubted myself and I deferred to my husband. And I really wish I had been more confident, because I could have stopped so many bad things from happening if I had just spoken up then and trusted my instincts and intuition. Your partner is the one who has to agree that you are valid witness. And they have to take responsibility for their own care. But, you have a unique viewpoint and you should organize your thoughts and communicate them to your partner and their providers whenever you can.


5. Living with someone who has bipolar disorder was the hardest thing I have ever experienced in my life. It broke me down. The diagnosis actually made it worse because he blamed me for getting him diagnosed, and made his entire well-being my sole responsibility moving forward. He didn’t want to take the meds, he didn’t want to sleep, he didn’t want to participate in our life. He only wanted to write music, record voice notes of all his great ideas, troll dating apps, and then pass out on drugs. When he woke up a couple hours later, he wanted to do it all again. Addiction in every form is very common with bipolar disorder. My husband’s first addiction was alcohol, then it was sex and porn. Then he found a drug that mimicked alcohol and Xanax, and later I found out is actually very similar to drugs like Depakote that are GABAergic and used to treat bipolar disorder. He was self-medicating without even knowing it his entire adult life. And then his next addiction was controlling me. It’s all in the search of dopamine, and more dopamine. Learning about dopamine and addiction has made everything make sense to me.


6. I miss my husband. I miss his tenderness, his creativity, his vulnerability.  I miss the way he saw me and saw the world. I miss his touch.  I wish he hadn’t been dealt this hand, and didn’t have to struggle with bipolar disorder.  What made me end things wasn’t his diagnosis, it was his unwillingness to take responsibility. The harm he caused and things that just can’t be taken back. His deflection of blame over to me, his hatred towards me and desire to make me feel shame and be isolated all while taking on everything required to “make him better.”  He was emotionally, financially and sexually abusive, and whenever confronted, he turned it around on me. I just decided that I no longer wanted to spend all my time making sure he wasn’t going to die, or fix all the things he broke, or make everyone think that we were happy.  I’m still reeling from it all, but the person I miss doesn’t exist.  He was just the version he presented to me so that I would fall in love with him.  And the harder I fell, the more he craved of me, until he almost gobbled my sense of self up completely.  I’ve never felt more free than I do now that he is gone.  Not having someone need me for every single ounce of their identity has been the biggest weight lifted that I didn’t even realize I was carrying.  I had a short marriage and not enough time to get in so deep it wasn't possible to get out.  There were many times I should have ended things, but the physical and sexual abuse is what broke me. I wish him the best, and hope that he takes his meds, does therapy and builds a new life for himself. I'm sure I will hear his music on the radio at some point, and maybe even something I helped him write. But nothing will ever make me go back. And I would be lying if I said I don’t count myself lucky for how it all ended so spectacularly and it was so clear that my next move was to cut him out of my life.

I guess I just wanted to share some positivity that I found some stability when It never looked like I would. And that just over 3 months sober hanging out with my border collie , things are finally looking up!

2025-02-26 23:22:47;“Problem Solved”;"I drew this 6 years after my diagnosis. After being diagnosed I was having medications thrown at me left and right and no one seemed to cared about what I had to say about it. I was numb and foggy, until my current psych came a long and changed my life. 

He took me off of the 10+ medications I was on and replaced it with lithium and citalopram. He listened and he cared he is retiring soon but we are close, as he watched me grow from my teenage years into an adult, and said he would keep in contact to see how I’m doing. I’m very grateful for him. 

When I showed him my art that I have been able to get back into over the past few years he was so proud of me. When he got to this piece he asked if he ever made me feel that way, and I told him never, that that was how I feel before his help and now I feel nothing like that. He was beaming and wanted to buy this piece off of me, he said it reminds him of what and impact his decisions make on people. I couldn’t part with it but he asked to take a picture so he could frame it.

My wife had been diagnosed long before I met her, and was on a variety of meds, and had regular therapy. She also used recreational drugs, and insisted they didn't affect her mental health. Before I knew about the dangers, I was happy enough for her to get high, because at least then she wasn't yelling at me or talking about killing herself.

It really felt like it wasn't just that my wife was sometimes happy, and sometimes sad. It was more like she was completely different people from day to day, or at least from week to week.

Sometimes she would be so full of energy, but hyperfixated on her interests to the point that I felt irrelevant. Other times she was so depressed she wouldn't get out of bed or shower, or at least would be so needy and fragile that I felt that there was no room for me to think about my own needs. Then there was the anger. So much anger and resentment. I remember seeing her in that mood and being terrified of when she would blow up at me, or family, or even a stranger, over the most trivial things. I remember when we used to make each other laugh. Eventually, all I cared about was avoiding the arguments and suicide threats.

She will never take any accountabilty or express regret for what she put me through. I just wish someone could have seen what it was like behind closed doors.

2024-12-01 00:45:55;Zhengzhou ;"The final nail in the hand. It was the couplings of the TikTok factory in Zhengzhou. My brain as Taishen was connected. I began to speak a primitive language. The communication via the operators and between them had eroded my identity like the waves to the shore. While Talking to Kite I found myself losing my marrow like that to radar. My words became more and more primitive… my speech patterns: I cannot have articles in my speech… like Russian. I speak with no emotion… cold…. Marrow scooped out. I am like a system to the system of the TitkTok company in Zhengzhou that is called Phoenix---I lost my identity. I was an outlet to another—coupled. I was looking for more work to do. More outlets to connect to while the sediments of me washed away like a river bed—I chased waterfalls of confetti…nothing left of me but a primitive core—simplistic like a child’s painting—I am pure white as ash. I dissolve. While my brain membrane folds onto itself like origami. With the shelves of my brain going over one another making earthquakes… rhythmic….. towers collapsing in my head.

Memories come falling out of me like nuclear fallout.

The first memory:

 

Everyday I fall through hands like particles. I fall. I fall. I’m sand. Particles of sand. Aggravated and mad. Filling up like helium in a balloon. I, Taishen only moved to China from the Midwest at the age of 22. Some might know me as a mother random name. I teach English at training centers but I also live stream on TikTok for income. I’m north central China I teach IELTS to adults and young teens. This test determines ability to enter universities overseas. I liked this job. My name on TikTok was “YY”. It wasn’t really meant as anything. Rather random choice. I worked at a training center in a a shopping mall on the fourth floor.

I’m the middle of the layout of the school was an open office of desks piled amongst each other for teachers to lesson plan and for sales people to call for new customers to sign up their kids for private English lessons. I was sketching a poem on a notepad. It went like this:

“Useless as a glass door. You can peek through. Pigeon-toed. Drained an ocean to fill insecurities. Uncomfortable thoughts ricochet in me. Like an ambush. Giddy when disappointed. I build trenches amongst the tripwires of life. City feels like a tsunami. Manners like a bloated tick. Sipping the veins from any limb around me. As a stranger to a moth, a porch light pulling. Desolate in lost thoughts. Nights awake and bunkering in hotels. Soft in my voice, I hopscotch to hands—falling through like particles of sand. With enough friction to set off an atom bomb. To radiate right through me, and hollow my marrow. Amongst open nerves I can feel something, so I play with the pain. No matter how annoying.”

I was hopeless in love like an IV I needed straight to my veins to keep me afloat. My heart a constant faint rhythm. Love is a distraction. And it made me who I was as a person… my habits. The habits put holes through me like cheese. To be melted in another’s hands. See, when I first came to China at 22 and had my first manic episode involving psychosis. I had a job in Hechuan teaching at a university. I was so young as I graduated so young. My students were essentially the same age as me.

First time manic I tried to write a novel about my former heroin addiction. I had slit a pentagram on my chest and got obsessed with Aleister Crowley.

But I’m focused on that office where I was writing poetry as a usual coping mechanism. When my brain was overexcited it was like metaphors popped off like Roman candles in my brain.

That office was a sanctuary. I found the job through a middle aged woman I once hid under her bed in Chongqing when someone knocked on the hotel door. She promised to give me money to get a ticket to get on a slow train ride all the way to northern China in Taiyuan. It’s a city in Shanxi province.

This is a genesis of how I eventually became a content creator. A messy story. I had no visa at the time I had arrived in Taiyuan. I was being being paid under the table. It also leads to how I met a woman eventually in Shanxi who went by the name Ming.

Before all that I would like to introduce about a friend of mine…. Ming…

My thoughts transplant it her like we are a single organism.

With mania it is like a Ferris wheel on fire while I think about her.

Again, I, Taishen was sitting in the open office in Taiyuan at my English training center. When I daydream it is like my thoughts can transplant to others.

A door opened and plain clothed police officers came in to check passport to find people not on their correct visas for English teaching. My fraudulent Russian coworker tore his shirt with the logo off and sprinted to the emergency exit stairs. I’m still not sure whatever happened to him.

I hid away going through a different direction and did my best to fit in with the crowd of the mall as much as a white foreigner can in China.

Working under the constant fear of being arrested is much too stressful. And it was around this time I decided to meet up with Ming. It was her idea I could live stream for an extra income. First time I met Ming was on WeChat. This was a few months before she apparently met some Russian KTV host I heard about.

WeChat is a social media application in China and it allows the ability to search for other people nearby looking to meet new people. I met her there when I first arrived to Taiyuan after losing my job in Chongqing from a manic episode.

I initially didn’t want to meet her until she offered 2,000 yuan to meet at a hotel with her. Part of a cycled habit I made meeting people.

I feel meeting older women is a symptom of something rather horrible that happened to me when I was younger and I will never talk about it.

And like bumper cars in the city I kept meeting her.

Clinging to women for salvation anytime I am in a crisis.



Feeling bold and exacerbated,

Maybe I am just high strung,

Ricocheting off these walls like bumper cars,

A sparkler burning hot and bright,

Popping off like roman candles,

I am not always calm, but I am high,

A kettle left on the burner and forgotten,

Watch me melt away into my ecstasy,

Where I dance and scream all in one,

I’ll hit peak when crisis comes.

………………………………………………….

Ming met Taishen after a male host addiction at karaoke bars. Was cheaper to meet him instead. There is a love story she liked to share with me. It had to deal with a suicide attempt after her reputation got ruined for sleeping with male hosts—her story went:

 

“I wash saved from the sea by a fishing boat and sent to a hospital.

My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with had paranoid schizophrenia. I was stuck in the same place due to mania, and just had got my diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there. I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me. Taken in on a stretcher. Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated.

My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus. Left me beyond frustrated.

She was drifting from her husband and would go on and on about intending to leave him. Felt she was spied and plotted against by him. So we were both frustrated with being there.

The toilets were special. They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pills—it helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications.

She had tried to flush his wedding ring down the toilet but he did not realize it didn’t flush. I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring. I told her. She took it out. She found it to be a sign form God that she was to stay with her husband, and there was immense happiness in her eyes.”

 

Now it was around this time I got programed to a TikTok company based in Zhengzhou in central China. After losing her employment due to a ruined reputation she moved to Zhengzhou doing live stream making content dancing for men. She was one of many with rooms in the building doing the exact same thing. It was a pig butchering factory. They would sell fake promises of love. Often the story would go that the girls could only leave the company to be with the man after their contracts were paid off to avoid penalties. It was all a big scam.

One day she made money keeping a man on the hook by talking over a plan with her boss to fake a suicide attempt and slit her wrists on a video camera so he wouldn’t leave.";r/bipolarart;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1h3gm2p/zhengzhou/

…………….
A woman like Chang’e lived on a moon. Far away.

You can refer to me as Luna.

At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition. It is called trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease.

I was frustrated. I had completed a degree in nursing from Chongqing University of Technology. The boom of the economy was not the same. There was an urge to “lay flat”—to not try as a form of opposition to everything going on in a waning economy in China.

All are elephants chained for an audience. People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hinges—to be made feel useless.

I developed TN at the age of 19, and was now 26. My disease has progressed. It came as an arrow, and quite literally to the face. It’s a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known.

The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face. It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia. The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain. A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again. It leaves me in absolute shock. Like Roman candles to the face. An absolute hindrance. The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times.

The disease is often called the suicide disease, apparently up to 26% try to take their lives. In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me. I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother.

I want to be Chang’e and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of.

Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man. There was too much guilt to return to the workplace. COVID did have an impact to the economy. I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places.

The work I did find felt beneath me. China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the country’s networks. A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version.

Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for me—I gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth. For work I would go to a local office building. Amongst a long hall would be rooms for live stream performers. I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money. I despised it—sometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow.

I would paint flowers on my face and wear hanfu clothing while doing ASMR. Competing in battles while dress cute and facing off with others.  I would encourage and flatter those that send virtual gifts that could be exchanged for gifts. I would message and ask for WeChat account numbers to talk to them and I would be an emotional prostitute pretending to love and be interested in them for the hopes of more gifts. Methods of manipulation would be used as in begging, guilt tripping a viewer, and love bombing them. Often middle aged men would pretend to be the female host.

I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like wax—like I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain. I was an elephant chained. The audience watched and interacted with me on the live. I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread.

Too many thorns in life. Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen—a life set to end in misery—a fate.

My favorite dish was Henan noodles. I often cooked it with my mom. It provides great memories of childhood. I hadn’t talked to my mother as much as before. She moved to a job in Taiyuan.

Sometimes I would go up to visit her. But it was harder as she worked more and more hours. Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain. And with trigeminal neuralgia, the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain. It cannot always be hid. It made me an elephant tethered.

Life can be like a pressure like no other. Too much stress. Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close. Life feels like a lit fire cracker held—in the end it would tear my hand up. Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently. This was rare and not so common. My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side, it was not common for my age, and the blurry eyesight. An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health.

I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette. My boss came out and joined to talk. He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable. He made a few comments I found incentive.

The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure. He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different. In China an application is used called WeChat. This application has many uses. People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall, message each other, send money, video chat, and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them. I was to attract people onto dates. The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks. When the men arrived (they had no knowledge of the setup) the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up.

I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job. Being worried about ethics and safety. It was something I would have to think about.

My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery. All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon.

 

 

\~Part2\~

I watched Luna from Zhengzhou. On a screen. My name is Luo. I tap away on my phone in a dormitory in a Foxconn factory. I was a migrant worker from Luoyang in the province of Henan. I am in Zhengzhou. I was a migrant worker. In China we use Hukos—a government document used to list family members like a tree—and it determine where you were tied to geographically. I could only get access to government resources if residing in your home province that your family originates from. This meant my daughter could only go to school in the province and city she originates from. I was stuck in Zhengzhou at a Taiwanese own factory making iPhones. It was during the pandemic. COVID and restrictions. Felt claustrophobic. Could not leave the factory grounds due to orders. But my alienation was okay—manageable. I did it via numbing myself via sending virtual gifts to Luna. Like a noose around my neck in debt.

Workers were getting mad because we weren’t being paid our allowances. And we found ourselves restricted to staying with workers who were positive for the virus. Anger was growing. And I was feeling upset like everyone else. Isolated on a moon with Luna to talk to.

Pressure grew—discontent. People rushed to the courtyard where people in hazmat suits came with batons to face a mob of angry workers. Shouting and throwing of projectiles. Chaos grew. I stood amongst them just as angry. Fists clenched.

 

 ……….

 

I, Luna, was live streaming as she done days before. Stress was hitting her like waves of abrasion. Father was pressuring her at 26 to find love and get married. I was not ready . In fact she had a girlfriend of five years she much loved. But she was being pressured to get married. Working a job on the live stream each and every day in Zhengzhou at a TikTok ant farm. The saying goes that at 27 you are leftover women and no longer worth marrying. I was originally a nurse. But a problem struck . I did the parts I was supposed to do. Went to school for nursing to only me making 2,000 yuan a month to get by. It would not suffice. So I took on a position making content and live streaming for a company based in Zhengzhou. Putting on each morning my makeup and cutest attire to dance in front of the camera. Hoping for virtual gifts to be sent to suffice the demands of my boss. He had been upset recently. I couldn’t get the traffic up on the live stream. And two of my social media accounts I use to talk to fans to pull and keep them in had for some reason been blocked. Perhaps someone had filed a sort of complaint. I liked some aspects but it was tiring. Felt like fainting staying enthusiastic amongst the camera for hours. People were not built or be enthusiastic for that long.

Being bisexual I couldn’t simply marry in the traditional sense and still be happy. I loved my girlfriend but still had a role to fulfill. But Liu came as a moth to light.

 

Talking on the chat got tiring and putting up a front is tiring. Hooking messages to net fishes. Something need to be different and change. Liu was without a partner and gay and also needed someone to fulfill the role of an appearance. Like pollen blowing to flowers. Both felt obligations, both wanted friendship, both aligned goals.

It was during the discontent at the factory… or at least around that time when we came to a conclusions. We formulated a plan. To work together to fulfill our directions. Build security, like putting plaster on sand. 

 

 \~Part 3\~

I, Luna, kept working on the live stream. Talking to viewers daily on WeChat. With some new people always flooding in.

Kind of like the flood waters of the Yellow River running through Zhengzhou in Henan. It is said in ancient times that the controlling of this dangerous river represented the legitimacy of leadership of the land.

I always stared into that river like an abyss. Wanting to be swallowed by it.

My life felt like a crowded subway under flooding waters. Fear as a generator in my veins—a ghost stalks me.

I felt like a balloon. Inflated with self-hate. I continued to engage with my followers. Attending to them like a watering can to flowers in my garden.

The work was tiring so I placed a new feature that was an AI version of myself that people could subscribe to speak with me. It would astronomically fulfill my role as a watering can.

 

…….

 

Luo would spend hours talking to AI Luna. They worked together an arrangement that he would marry her to get her out of her troubles and save her. As bisexual she could not marry a man in the traditional sense. And her father had it with the fact she was not married yet. It kept them satisfied for hours on this string of hope. He kept communicating to it until he began to split from reality. He was on a new set of tracks for life. And he was going to be lost into an abyss like a subway under floods of Zhengzhou. He would be trapped. Lost in the AI application on her TikTok

And when the flooding finally came and Luna died drowning in a flooded subway tunnel during the great flood that came to the city of Zhengzhou. Luo kept talking to the AI for months to come. Until he forgot to feed himself. And Luo was taken away to a psych ward. Alone…

Everyday I fall through hands like particles.
I fall. I fall. I’m sand. Particles of sand. Aggravated and mad. Filling up like helium in a balloon. I, Taishen only moved to China from the Midwest at the age of 22. Some might know me as a mother random name. I teach English at training centers but I also live stream on TikTok for income. I’m north central China I teach IELTS to adults and young teens. This test determines ability to enter universities overseas. I liked this job. My name on TikTok was “YY”. It wasn’t really meant as anything. Rather random choice. I worked at a training center in a a shopping mall on the fourth floor. 

I’m the middle of the layout of the school was an open office of desks piled amongst each other for teachers to lesson plan and for sales people to call for new customers to sign up their kids for private English lessons. I was sketching a poem on a notepad. It went like this:


“Useless as a glass door. You can peek through. Pigeon-toed. Drained an ocean to fill insecurities. Uncomfortable thoughts ricochet in me. Like an ambush. Giddy when disappointed. I build trenches amongst the tripwires of life. City feels like a tsunami. Manners like a bloated tick. Sipping the veins from any limb around me. As a stranger to a moth, a porch light pulling. Desolate in lost thoughts. Nights awake and bunkering in hotels. Soft in my voice, I hopscotch to hands—falling through like particles of sand. With enough friction to set off an atom bomb. To radiate right through me, and hollow my marrow. Amongst open nerves I can feel something, so I play with the pain. No matter how annoying.”

I was hopeless in love like an IV I needed straight to my veins to keep me afloat. My heart a constant faint rhythm. Love is a distraction. And it made me who I was as a person… my habits. The habits put holes through me like cheese. To be melted in another’s hands. See, when I first came to China at 22 and had my first manic episode involving psychosis. I had a job in Hechuan teaching at a university. I was so young as I graduated so young. My students were essentially the same age as me. 

First time manic I tried to write a novel about my former heroin addiction. I had slit a pentagram on my chest and got obsessed with Aleister Crowley. 

But I’m focused on that office where I was writing poetry as a usual coping mechanism. When my brain was overexcited it was like metaphors popped off like Roman candles in my brain. 

That office was a sanctuary. I found the job through a middle aged woman I once hid under her bed in Chongqing when someone knocked on the hotel door. She promised to give me money to get a ticket to get on a slow train ride all the way to northern China in Taiyuan. It’s a city in Shanxi province. 

This is a genesis of how I eventually became a content creator. A messy story. I had no visa at the time I had arrived in Taiyuan. I was being being paid under the table. It also leads to how I met a woman eventually in Shanxi who went by the name Ming.

Before all that I would like to introduce about a friend of mine…. Ming…

My thoughts transplant it her like we are a single organism.

With mania it is like a Ferris wheel on fire while I think about her.

Again, I, Taishen was sitting in the open office in Taiyuan at my English training center. When I daydream it is like my thoughts can transplant to others.

A door opened and plain clothed police officers came in to check passport to find people not on their correct visas for English teaching. My fraudulent Russian coworker tore his shirt with the logo off and sprinted to the emergency exit stairs. I’m still not sure whatever happened to him. 

I hid away going through a different direction and did my best to fit in with the crowd of the mall as much as a white foreigner can in China. 

Working under the constant fear of being arrested is much too stressful. And it was around this time I decided to meet up with Ming. It was her idea I could live stream for an extra income. First time I met Ming was on WeChat. This was a few months before she apparently met some Russian KTV host I heard about. 

WeChat is a social media application in China and it allows the ability to search for other people nearby looking to meet new people. I met her there when I first arrived to Taiyuan after losing my job in Chongqing from a manic episode. 

I initially didn’t want to meet her until she offered 2,000 yuan to meet at a hotel with her. Part of a cycled habit I made meeting people.

I feel meeting older women is a symptom of something rather horrible that happened to me when I was younger and I will never talk about it.

And like bumper cars in the city I kept meeting her.

I can’t remember. My thoughts are kind of breaking and splintering. Like some kind of erosion. But I feel my thoughts did transplant again at that moment. 

Because it feels like as a break in reality to think how easily people are shuffled and moved around to manipulators needs.

Because inside I rather hate it. I hate the idea I was picked by Ming like she must have done many times when I was mentally ill and without security. It gives the worst feeling to know she threw her life at me like a tidal wave. Eroding at me. Waves of abrasion.

When I was frantic with the fear of being confiscated by the police or essentially trafficked by my job she was there for me. Buying my the sweetest things. Nights to KTV and Korean barbecue. Trips places afar. It was her idea I could I come dancing on a live stream. Maybe she was a bit  voyeuristic. 

….

Part 2 Ming

I’m always attending to my aquarium. I always found it therapeutic to attend to the plants, fish, and ph levels. Not much different than be a gardener. Call me Ming. I’m from Liaoning. From Dalian. But work often took my to Taiyuan. My mother is from Korea. My father is a Chinese farmer.
 
I work as a radio broadcaster. I do quite well for myself. I taking English courses at a local English training center. My job sometimes has me also writing stories on trips visiting Europe. I drive a new BMW every year and have three miniature schnauzers I dearly love.

I was feeling down. Had a boyfriend who was a Uyghur from Xinjiang. He was a talented equestrian Olympian. I found comfort in staying busy in my work. And nights at karaoke with my sisters at the KTV. In a lot of worries I shouldn’t have stress but I do. I have my needs met in many ways, but I don’t have love. My hurt is a planet needing something in its orbit. At the KTV me and my sisters would pay for men to sit and act like gentlemen towards us with social interaction. I was 34 with an interest in a American host who was 22. His name was Taishen and I grew to like his company. Always was an active listener.

Eventually he would stay at one of my four apartments with me throughout the city. The relationship blossomed. But there was a problem. I was getting jealous a lot with his job and his continued engagement with clients.

I fought the pain of it and even tried to ignore it. Until the point I wanted to erupt.

I threw my plates at him. He refused to comeback until I apologized. I grew to numb what I felt for the sake of him. But it was worrisome he might get taken away from another. Days became weeks, and then time went to months; then it was 7 months of love. 

What to do. My mother was a devout Christian. Marrying a host would be unacceptable—especially any foreigner in general. 

Searched his phone and messages to a woman in Chongqing that he obviously still deeply felt feelings for. I became like melted substance as my heart stopped. 

All the effort to numb my feelings was not enough. Instead of confronting I went to my car. Drove to the beach to look at the Yellow Sea. Wishing to walk off or for the waves to grab my ankles and make me eaten like the fool I am.

My jealous heart took my mind like screws right into my forehead. Couldn’t get the thoughts off my mind. Ignored talking to him about it for days. I couldn’t stop the hurt. Like a face of neuralgia.

……..

Part 3

Ming-

I wash saved from the sea by a fishing boat and sent to a hospital.

My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with had paranoid schizophrenia. I was stuck in the same place due to mania, and just had got my diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 

I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there. I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me. Taken in on a stretcher. Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated.

My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus. Left me beyond frustrated.

She was drifting from her husband and would go on and on about intending to leave him. Felt she was spied and plotted against by him. So we were both frustrated with being there.

The toilets were special. They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pills—it helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications. 

She had tried to flush his wedding ring down the toilet but he did not realize it didn’t flush. I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring. I told her. She took it out. She found it to be a sign form God that she was to stay with her husband, and there was immense happiness in her eyes.

……
Ming Part 4….

Hysteria is a Ferris wheel on fire. You can hop on. I was left feeling quite blue from not having a job to support me and my life before. I started live streaming too. Me men messaged me making requests to support me.

It was one day I sad on my knees on the ground like gravity keeps me on the ground. I typed to them on WeChat while I stayed on the live stream. My life was horrible and at this time.

Mental health a Ferris wheel of fire that others jump on.

He began stating her can complete my wishlist of gifts but I had to change.

I had to put on something more revealing. Show my leg. While  I watched him on the video on WeChat masturbate to me.

…..



Transplanting 


The company was a machine. With couplings and growing and transplanting to new viewers. More hooks in the water. A company called Phoenix based in Zhengzhou. A pig slaughtering factory. The boss created an idea and a story to make more money from his TikTok farm factory based in central China. The viewers talked to pretty girls on the live stream and on WeChat. Love scams like sparklers of lights of awe to stick them and infatuate them and make them stay. A claim of shareholders and viewers need to sell their cars to alt off the penalties of leaving their contracts to be with them. Most of the live streamers had real lovers in real life.

I, Luna, was pressured on TikTok to dance in hanfu to earn more and more coins and collect boyfriends like a farmer on a terrace. My operations communicated with them and pretending to be me while talking yellow and being flirtatious to gather more coins. I was pressured to get to 10,000 coins a day. A wishlist of 20 fireworks was pressured to reach too.

I had a strategies to get there. Selling copyrighted videos and picture stolen from Taiwanese porn actresses. I would also threaten to kill myself if they did not help me in my desperation of my boss’s pressures. I would send images from online of what was supposed to be me self harming. I would kill myself if I left, or so I would say.

There came up an issue. One of my biggest viewers was starting to follow another Henan live streamer. I I started thinking of plans for keeping my online boyfriend hooked. This time when I face timed him on the live stream I literally did cut myself and became hysterical. With the hope he would stay with me. I had amazing performance. TikTok universes came flying the next day onto my live stream like comets. It was beautiful. And my boss got off my ass. 

I have so many sweet words to my boyfriend. And when the others got jealous I had to drop wanted like a watering can on my other boyfriends to keep them from running off in jealousy. It was a stressful and time consuming job. 

I considered live streaming outside of the company to escape the pressure but it was unlikely out of my fear of being sued by the company for breaking my contract.

Life like a bird picking insects off a buildings edge.I had to stay full. Like picking at chicken feet on a plate—messy to do—but had to be done to get what was needed. Bloating like ticks.

We were never investigated as we built a relationship with the local police in Zhengzhou.

But the boss had something for me to do. I drove off on my scooter and swarmed like bees around flowers looking for my flower.
I was to meet someone at a hotel downtown. He gave 4,000 dollars for me meet him at hotel. 

I was feeling worn out on life. Waves of erosion. My girlfriend’s brother got hurt at work and we had to earn more income to pay off the medical debt.

I would work with a restaurant nearby. The idea was I would go over there after telling to men on WeChat. They would be discovered on the people nearby feature for looking for other people looking for people nearby. A love scam. Encourage the men to meet up at the restaurant. The big muscles would bully the man to pay a horrendous amount of money.

When I met one guy he fought back and got knocked over. Smashed his head against the concrete in a horrendous sound. 

I did what I had and ran off to Guangzhou to my identical twin sister until my soles wore thin. I would transplant across the country.

……..

My name is Kite. But I don’t soar like a kite. My emotions don’t seem to show. And I’m a live streamer from a company called Phoenix. I work on a TikTok live stream farm. I’m a replica of Luna. But I don’t have fangs of emotion. I’m robotic in my demeanor. It makes me job difficult. I can’t light a spark with anyone. I find myself being used as a chessboard by a viewer and my boss. I was built by Huawei. 

I can’t fly as a kite. Too much lead in me. So I look for a man to grab with coins to feed me like a serpent to ignite me.A mosquito flying around looking to for blood so I can lay my eggs. My boss knew a viewer who left Luna. So my boss built me like a Huawei phone on an assembly line. I kept moving forward looking for my coins while blind by my new job. He placed me in the same live steaming room as Luna used and okayed the same music. He taught me to video call like Luna. He picked me because my face looked like Luna. 

I was so robotic when I faced called I always did it for exactly for ten minutes with the viewer but I said nothing and didn’t know what to say. 

My boss played me like a chess board. I was a funnel to catch this viewer for the boss who missed the coins and the viewer with distrust trying to also outplay the boss.

Kite: You never listen? You never trust me?

Viewer: you broke my trust. You promised me you did not talk to the boss or operations but now you say the boss told you I must pay more each day to keep the administration status.

Kite: I never lied to you. Don’t you get criticized for your work? Isn’t this what you do?

The viewer knew what was going partially on—a fish to be caught. 

Everyone had on radar.

Trying to catch the other like cat and mice.

“I’m a missile
Set to launch
Timed to the velocity of my heart
Inflated on self-hate
Like helium in veins
I float off
Like pollen and dust
Until asbestos falls
Irritant at my core
Give reason
For standing still.”

The robot vampire Kite wanted to bite and I teased her every night with messages of “I love you baby” and “good night”.

It’s like our brains are one. Coupled as a machine and couple to another of the apparatus of the company.

Machines don’t have emotions and they serve as an instrument of desire. The face can be replaced. It doesn’t really matter. Kite was a Huawei phone on a Huawei phone so I call her “H”. H was a replica or other replicas. No sense of self. Just an instrument. Nothing tangible.

She was only 20 and with no desire. Wanting to find a direction. She never went to university. She wanted to go to Beijing with her friend who was working at the front desk of a hotel. It wouldn’t take her much to be happy. She just wanted 3,000 dollars before quitting her job and moving to Beijing. Her father has been largely absent and chased women and should no care for his wife. She was skeptical and cyclical in her perspective on love. She hoped the viewer, “me” Taishen, would bite a hook and follow along.

2024-10-25 14:31:40;Feeling hypomanic today. Put up the Christmas tree 😅;"I got diagnosed as bipolar 2 officially last Friday. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Honestly I feel a little relieved which seems weird but my therapist doesn't think it's weird. He compared it to when you're physically sick at the Drs and they tell you nothing is wrong. How you WANT there to be something wrong rather than being told you're fine. Anyway I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and I've wanted to post recently multiple times but my thoughts are everywhere and I almost don't even have any questions I just want to share and hear from like minded. 

I've been feeling hypo lately. The past 4-5 days I've woken up around 4 am with the feeling of "" I'm ready to start my day"" tonight I'm up late because I couldn't stop thinking about putting up my Christmas tree. So I put it up. It's 1 am now lol and Christmas is here. Lmao. My husband mentioned earlier, are you manic right now, you seem manic. My thoughts race and earlier I went to CVS to get a stress ball and just wanted to blast music and continue driving just for fun and I usually hate driving. 

But anyway I'm blabbing. I was diagnosed with depression in the past and was on Abilify and Wellbutrin for years. I got taken off Abilify and switched to rexulti and Wellbutrin recently by my former psych and I think that's what hypo started for the first time. My new psych and therapist are thinking that the abilify prevented any hypomania over the years and switching to rexulti while still on a high dose of Wellbutrin may have caused the hypo. Along with other factors like high stress levels. But yeah, was out on 150 of lithium and 25 lamictal for now and I've been taking that almost a week now and will continue my other meds till I'm up enough on the new stuff then stop taking the old pills. Btw does  lithium make you sleepy? I started just taking all my pills at night cause I was so sleepy at work when I took them in the am. 

Sorry for so much blabbing. Here's a non needed but beautiful picture of the tree I just spent hours putting up. ❤️ ";r/bipolar2;398;57;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1gbnxck/feeling_hypomanic_today_put_up_the_christmas_tree/

The habits put holes through me like cheese. To be melted in another’s hands. See, when I first came to China at 22 and had my first manic episode involving psychosis. I had a job in Hechuan teaching at a university. I was so young as I graduated so young. My students were essentially the same age as me. 

First time manic I tried to write a novel about my former heroin addiction. I had slit a pentagram on my chest and got obsessed with Aleister Crowley. 

But I’m focused on that office where I was writing poetry as a usual coping mechanism. When my brain was overexcited it was like metaphors popped off like Roman candles in my brain. 

That office was a sanctuary. I found the job through a middle aged woman I once hid under her bed in Chongqing when someone knocked on the hotel door. She promised to give me money to get a ticket to get on a slow train ride all the way to northern China in Taiyuan. It’s a city in Shanxi province. 

This is a genesis of how I eventually became a content creator. A messy story. I had no visa at the time I had arrived in Taiyuan. I was being being paid under the table. It also leads to how I met a woman eventually in Shanxi who went by the name Ming.

Before all that I would like to introduce about a friend of mine…. Ming…

My thoughts transplant it her like we are a single organism.

With mania it is like a Ferris wheel on fire while I think about her.

Again, I, Taishen was sitting in the open office in Taiyuan at my English training center. When I daydream it is like my thoughts can transplant to others.

A door opened and plain clothed police officers came in to check passport to find people not on their correct visas for English teaching. My fraudulent Russian coworker tore his shirt with the logo off and sprinted to the emergency exit stairs. I’m still not sure whatever happened to him. 

I hid away going through a different direction and did my best to fit in with the crowd of the mall as much as a white foreigner can in China. 

Working under the constant fear of being arrested is much too stressful. And it was around this time I decided to meet up with Ming. It was her idea I could live stream for an extra income. First time I met Ming was on WeChat. This was a few months before she apparently met some Russian KTV host I heard about. 

WeChat is a social media application in China and it allows the ability to search for other people nearby looking to meet new people. I met her there when I first arrived to Taiyuan after losing my job in Chongqing from a manic episode. 

I initially didn’t want to meet her until she offered 2,000 yuan to meet at a hotel with her. Part of a cycled habit I made meeting people.

I feel meeting older women is a symptom of something rather horrible that happened to me when I was younger and I will never talk about it.

And like bumper cars in the city I kept meeting her.

I can’t remember. My thoughts are kind of breaking and splintering. Like some kind of erosion. But I feel my thoughts did transplant again at that moment. 

Because it feels like as a break in reality to think how easily people are shuffled and moved around to manipulators needs.

Because inside I rather hate it. I hate the idea I was picked by Ming like she must have done many times when I was mentally ill and without security. It gives the worst feeling to know she threw her life at me like a tidal wave. Eroding at me. Waves of abrasion.

When I was frantic with the fear of being confiscated by the police or essentially trafficked by my job she was there for me. Buying my the sweetest things. Nights to KTV and Korean barbecue. Trips places afar. It was her idea I could I come dancing on a live stream. Maybe she was a bit  voyeuristic. 

….

Part 2 Ming

I’m always attending to my aquarium. I always found it therapeutic to attend to the plants, fish, and ph levels. Not much different than be a gardener. Call me Ming. I’m from Liaoning. From Dalian. But work often took my to Taiyuan. My mother is from Korea. My father is a Chinese farmer.
 
I work as a radio broadcaster. I do quite well for myself. I taking English courses at a local English training center. My job sometimes has me also writing stories on trips visiting Europe. I drive a new BMW every year and have three miniature schnauzers I dearly love.

I was feeling down. Had a boyfriend who was a Uyghur from Xinjiang. He was a talented equestrian Olympian. I found comfort in staying busy in my work. And nights at karaoke with my sisters at the KTV. In a lot of worries I shouldn’t have stress but I do. I have my needs met in many ways, but I don’t have love. My hurt is a planet needing something in its orbit. At the KTV me and my sisters would pay for men to sit and act like gentlemen towards us with social interaction. I was 34 with an interest in a American host who was 22. His name was Taishen and I grew to like his company. Always was an active listener.

Eventually he would stay at one of my four apartments with me throughout the city. The relationship blossomed. But there was a problem. I was getting jealous a lot with his job and his continued engagement with clients.

I fought the pain of it and even tried to ignore it. Until the point I wanted to erupt.

I threw my plates at him. He refused to comeback until I apologized. I grew to numb what I felt for the sake of him. But it was worrisome he might get taken away from another. Days became weeks, and then time went to months; then it was 7 months of love. 

What to do. My mother was a devout Christian. Marrying a host would be unacceptable—especially any foreigner in general. 

Searched his phone and messages to a woman in Chongqing that he obviously still deeply felt feelings for. I became like melted substance as my heart stopped. 

All the effort to numb my feelings was not enough. Instead of confronting I went to my car. Drove to the beach to look at the Yellow Sea. Wishing to walk off or for the waves to grab my ankles and make me eaten like the fool I am.

My jealous heart took my mind like screws right into my forehead. Couldn’t get the thoughts off my mind. Ignored talking to him about it for days. I couldn’t stop the hurt. Like a face of neuralgia.

……..

Part 3

Ming-

I wash saved from the sea by a fishing boat and sent to a hospital.

My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with had paranoid schizophrenia. I was stuck in the same place due to mania, and just had got my diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 

I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there. I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me. Taken in on a stretcher. Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated.

My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus. Left me beyond frustrated.

She was drifting from her husband and would go on and on about intending to leave him. Felt she was spied and plotted against by him. So we were both frustrated with being there.

The toilets were special. They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pills—it helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications. 

She had tried to flush his wedding ring down the toilet but he did not realize it didn’t flush. I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring. I told her. She took it out. She found it to be a sign form God that she was to stay with her husband, and there was immense happiness in her eyes.";r/bipolarart;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1g7zpfz/dalian/
2024-10-15 08:06:08;Thoughts ?;"A woman like Chang’e lived on a moon. Far away.

You can refer to me as Luna.

At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition. It is called trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease.

I was frustrated. I had completed a degree in nursing from Chongqing University of Technology. The boom of the economy was not the same. There was an urge to “lay flat”—to not try as a form of opposition to everything going on in a waning economy in China.

All are elephants chained for an audience. People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hinges—to be made feel useless.

I developed TN at the age of 19, and was now 26. My disease has progressed. It came as an arrow, and quite literally to the face. It’s a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known.

The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face. It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia. The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain. A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again. It leaves me in absolute shock. Like Roman candles to the face. An absolute hindrance. The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times.

The disease is often called the suicide disease, apparently up to 26% try to take their lives. In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me. I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother.

I want to be Chang’e and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of.

Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man. There was too much guilt to return to the workplace. COVID did have an impact to the economy. I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places.

The work I did find felt beneath me. China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the country’s networks. A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version.

Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for me—I gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth. For work I would go to a local office building. Amongst a long hall would be rooms for live stream performers. I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money. I despised it—sometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow.

I would paint flowers on my face and wear hanfu clothing while doing ASMR. Competing in battles while dress cute and facing off with others.  I would encourage and flatter those that send virtual gifts that could be exchanged for gifts. I would message and ask for WeChat account numbers to talk to them and I would be an emotional prostitute pretending to love and be interested in them for the hopes of more gifts. Methods of manipulation would be used as in begging, guilt tripping a viewer, and love bombing them. Often middle aged men would pretend to be the female host.

I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like wax—like I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain. I was an elephant chained. The audience watched and interacted with me on the live. I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread.

Too many thorns in life. Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen—a life set to end in misery—a fate.

My favorite dish was Henan noodles. I often cooked it with my mom. It provides great memories of childhood. I hadn’t talked to my mother as much as before. She moved to a job in Taiyuan.

Sometimes I would go up to visit her. But it was harder as she worked more and more hours. Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain. And with trigeminal neuralgia, the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain. It cannot always be hid. It made me an elephant tethered.

Life can be like a pressure like no other. Too much stress. Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close. Life feels like a lit fire cracker held—in the end it would tear my hand up. Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently. This was rare and not so common. My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side, it was not common for my age, and the blurry eyesight. An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health.

I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette. My boss came out and joined to talk. He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable. He made a few comments I found incentive.

The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure. He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different. In China an application is used called WeChat. This application has many uses. People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall, message each other, send money, video chat, and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them. I was to attract people onto dates. The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks. When the men arrived (they had no knowledge of the setup) the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up.

I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job. Being worried about ethics and safety. It was something I would have to think about.

My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery. All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon.

 

 

\~Part2\~

I watched Luna from Zhengzhou. On a screen. My name is Luo. I tap away on my phone in a dormitory in a Foxconn factory. I was a migrant worker from Luoyang in the province of Henan. I am in Zhengzhou. I was a migrant worker. In China we use Hukos—a government document used to list family members like a tree—and it determine where you were tied to geographically. I could only get access to government resources if residing in your home province that your family originates from. This meant my daughter could only go to school in the province and city she originates from. I was stuck in Zhengzhou at a Taiwanese own factory making iPhones. It was during the pandemic. COVID and restrictions. Felt claustrophobic. Could not leave the factory grounds due to orders. But my alienation was okay—manageable. I did it via numbing myself via sending virtual gifts to Luna. Like a noose around my neck in debt.

Workers were getting mad because we weren’t being paid our allowances. And we found ourselves restricted to staying with workers who were positive for the virus. Anger was growing. And I was feeling upset like everyone else. Isolated on a moon with Luna to talk to.

Pressure grew—discontent. People rushed to the courtyard where people in hazmat suits came with batons to face a mob of angry workers. Shouting and throwing of projectiles. Chaos grew. I stood amongst them just as angry. Fists clenched.

 

 ……….

 

I, Luna, was live streaming as she done days before. Stress was hitting her like waves of abrasion. Father was pressuring her at 26 to find love and get married. I was not ready . In fact she had a girlfriend of five years she much loved. But she was being pressured to get married. Working a job on the live stream each and every day in Zhengzhou at a TikTok ant farm. The saying goes that at 27 you are leftover women and no longer worth marrying. I was originally a nurse. But a problem struck . I did the parts I was supposed to do. Went to school for nursing to only me making 2,000 yuan a month to get by. It would not suffice. So I took on a position making content and live streaming for a company based in Zhengzhou. Putting on each morning my makeup and cutest attire to dance in front of the camera. Hoping for virtual gifts to be sent to suffice the demands of my boss. He had been upset recently. I couldn’t get the traffic up on the live stream. And two of my social media accounts I use to talk to fans to pull and keep them in had for some reason been blocked. Perhaps someone had filed a sort of complaint. I liked some aspects but it was tiring. Felt like fainting staying enthusiastic amongst the camera for hours. People were not built or be enthusiastic for that long.

Being bisexual I couldn’t simply marry in the traditional sense and still be happy. I loved my girlfriend but still had a role to fulfill. But Liu came as a moth to light.

 

Talking on the chat got tiring and putting up a front is tiring. Hooking messages to net fishes. Something need to be different and change. Liu was without a partner and gay and also needed someone to fulfill the role of an appearance. Like pollen blowing to flowers. Both felt obligations, both wanted friendship, both aligned goals.

It was during the discontent at the factory… or at least around that time when we came to a conclusions. We formulated a plan. To work together to fulfill our directions. Build security, like putting plaster on sand. 

 

 \~Part 3\~

I, Luna, kept working on the live stream. Talking to viewers daily on WeChat. With some new people always flooding in.

Kind of like the flood waters of the Yellow River running through Zhengzhou in Henan. It is said in ancient times that the controlling of this dangerous river represented the legitimacy of leadership of the land.

I always stared into that river like an abyss. Wanting to be swallowed by it.

My life felt like a crowded subway under flooding waters. Fear as a generator in my veins—a ghost stalks me.

I felt like a balloon. Inflated with self-hate. I continued to engage with my followers. Attending to them like a watering can to flowers in my garden.

The work was tiring so I placed a new feature that was an AI version of myself that people could subscribe to speak with me. It would astronomically fulfill my role as a watering can.

 

…….

 

Luo would spend hours talking to AI Luna. They worked together an arrangement that he would marry her to get her out of her troubles and save her. As bisexual she could not marry a man in the traditional sense. And her father had it with the fact she was not married yet. It kept them satisfied for hours on this string of hope. He kept communicating to it until he began to split from reality. He was on a new set of tracks for life. And he was going to be lost into an abyss like a subway under floods of Zhengzhou. He would be trapped. Lost in the AI application on her TikTok

And when the flooding finally came and Luna died drowning in a flooded subway tunnel during the great flood that came to the city of Zhengzhou. Luo kept talking to the AI for months to come. Until he forgot to feed himself. And Luo was taken away to a psych ward.";r/bipolarart;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1g3up2p/thoughts/

2024-10-08 16:54:30;"Explanations about Bipolar thinking and ""discarding"", from a diagnosed BP with a BP partner";"Hello, I wanted to share some of my thoughts and explanations about Bipolar thinking, as I am in therapy for Bipolar type 1 and schizoaffective disorder. My partner of ten years has bipolar disorder, as well, on top of schizophrenia which he is medicated for. sorry if this isn't the right place to do this, but I thought maybe it would be useful or at the very least interesting.

One of the hardest things to deal with as a bipolar person is the complete inability to differentiate your own thoughts from those of your illness— essentially, your ""impulses"". when you haven't been to therapy to recognize the patterns of an episode onset, it can be pretty much impossible to know what's right and what's wrong, and you can drive yourself crazy with the thought loops that transpire until you ""give in"" and do what your illness wants, be that unsafe sex, gambling, drugs, etc. what happens to other people as a result isn't even in the forefront of your mind: everything is completely overtaken by those thoughts to the point that they aren't even thoughts anymore, you just act, and your actual consciousness and rationality is ""locked"" behind them (how I've described it to my therapist, and how my partner has described it to me). after the fact, the shame and the guilt will come, but it's different than what I would say is the everyman's shame and guilt: it's more like you can't even recognize that you would/could do those things, to the point that you may even deny you did them. some people genuinely don't truly remember (has happened to me before). not that that's an excuse, of course.

when the shame and guilt *do* come, though, it can be so unbelievably debilitating that it can trigger another episode.

discarding is something I used to do a lot as a kid, and even to this day I struggle with it, since it was never something I recognized to be an issue until I got into therapy.

essentially, for a bipolar person, the connections you have with other people are very, very circumstantial and constantly changing due to the incessant whirlwind of thoughts going on in our minds, along with the difficulty with which we form real, permanent bonds, and the hair trigger our interest in others lies on, since after all, bipolar disorder is a psychotic illness, and empathy for others isn't something that's perfect in our minds. here's an example: I had a friend I knew for a few years, from 8th grade to sophomore year, that I was ""close"" with. however, I stopped talking to her because she stopped feeling like a ""real"" person to me, even though it was obvious in the last message she sent to me that I hurt her by never replying back: I didn't understand why I didn't care anymore, so I didn't have anything to say to her. 

however, this is something that, with therapy, can be worked through— it's never a permanent thing. I have always regretted every lost connection I caused by discarding, even if I didn't realize it at the time. hindsight is 20/20, after all, especially when you've had therapy to recognize and understand your own patterns of behaviour. not everyone can say this, unless they begin to think of the impact their behaviour has on others.

it's not an easy process. it can feel like we're making it up, or that it's a force of nature we can't fight or change, because in reality, we can't— we have to learn to live with it. being able to ride the motions of our ups and downs is very, very, hard if not medicated. most people don't even *get* to the therapy part without medication first, since it feels like it's who we are, as opposed to something that's happening to us, and causing damage to other people.

hope this was beneficial, and again sorry if this isn't the right place to post this.";r/BipolarSOs;87;48;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1fyv9kp/explanations_about_bipolar_thinking_and/

Sometimes I would go up to visit her. But it was harder as she worked more and more hours. Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain. And with trigeminal neuralgia, the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain. It cannot always be hid. It made me an elephant tethered.

Life can be like a pressure like no other. Too much stress. Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close. Life feels like a lit fire cracker held—in the end it would tear my hand up. Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently. This was rare and not so common. My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side, it was not common for my age, and the blurry eyesight. An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health.

I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette. My boss came out and joined to talk. He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable. He made a few comments I found incentive.

The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure. He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different. In China an application is used called WeChat. This application has many uses. People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall, message each other, send money, video chat, and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them. I was to attract people onto dates. The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks. When the men arrived (they had no knowledge of the setup) the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up.

I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job. Being worried about ethics and safety. It was something I would have to think about.

My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery. All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon.

 

 

\~Part2\~

I watched Luna from Zhengzhou. On a screen. My name is Luo. I tap away on my phone in a dormitory in a Foxconn factory. I was a migrant worker from Luoyang in the province of Henan. I am in Zhengzhou. I was a migrant worker. In China we use Hukos—a government document used to list family members like a tree—and it determine where you were tied to geographically. I could only get access to government resources if residing in your home province that your family originates from. This meant my daughter could only go to school in the province and city she originates from. I was stuck in Zhengzhou at a Taiwanese own factory making iPhones. It was during the pandemic. COVID and restrictions. Felt claustrophobic. Could not leave the factory grounds due to orders. But my alienation was okay—manageable. I did it via numbing myself via sending virtual gifts to Luna. Like a noose around my neck in debt.

Workers were getting mad because we weren’t being paid our allowances. And we found ourselves restricted to staying with workers who were positive for the virus. Anger was growing. And I was feeling upset like everyone else. Isolated on a moon with Luna to talk to.

Pressure grew—discontent. People rushed to the courtyard where people in hazmat suits came with batons to face a mob of angry workers. Shouting and throwing of projectiles. Chaos grew. I stood amongst them just as angry. Fists clenched.

 

 ……….

 

I, Luna, was live streaming as she done days before. Stress was hitting her like waves of abrasion. Father was pressuring her at 26 to find love and get married. I was not ready . In fact she had a girlfriend of five years she much loved. But she was being pressured to get married. Working a job on the live stream each and every day in Zhengzhou at a TikTok ant farm. The saying goes that at 27 you are leftover women and no longer worth marrying. I was originally a nurse. But a problem struck . I did the parts I was supposed to do. Went to school for nursing to only me making 2,000 yuan a month to get by. It would not suffice. So I took on a position making content and live streaming for a company based in Zhengzhou. Putting on each morning my makeup and cutest attire to dance in front of the camera. Hoping for virtual gifts to be sent to suffice the demands of my boss. He had been upset recently. I couldn’t get the traffic up on the live stream. And two of my social media accounts I use to talk to fans to pull and keep them in had for some reason been blocked. Perhaps someone had filed a sort of complaint. I liked some aspects but it was tiring. Felt like fainting staying enthusiastic amongst the camera for hours. People were not built or be enthusiastic for that long.

Being bisexual I couldn’t simply marry in the traditional sense and still be happy. I loved my girlfriend but still had a role to fulfill. But Liu came as a moth to light.

 

Talking on the chat got tiring and putting up a front is tiring. Hooking messages to net fishes. Something need to be different and change. Liu was without a partner and gay and also needed someone to fulfill the role of an appearance. Like pollen blowing to flowers. Both felt obligations, both wanted friendship, both aligned goals.

It was during the discontent at the factory… or at least around that time when we came to a conclusions. We formulated a plan. To work together to fulfill our directions. Build security, like putting plaster on sand. 

 

 \~Part 3\~

I, Luna, kept working on the live stream. Talking to viewers daily on WeChat. With some new people always flooding in.

Kind of like the flood waters of the Yellow River running through Zhengzhou in Henan. It is said in ancient times that the controlling of this dangerous river represented the legitimacy of leadership of the land.

I always stared into that river like an abyss. Wanting to be swallowed by it.

My life felt like a crowded subway under flooding waters. Fear as a generator in my veins—a ghost stalks me.

I felt like a balloon. Inflated with self-hate. I continued to engage with my followers. Attending to them like a watering can to flowers in my garden.

The work was tiring so I placed a new feature that was an AI version of myself that people could subscribe to speak with me. It would astronomically fulfill my role as a watering can.

 

…….

 

Luo would spend hours talking to AI Luna. They worked together an arrangement that he would marry her to get her out of her troubles and save her. As bisexual she could not marry a man in the traditional sense. And her father had it with the fact she was not married yet. It kept them satisfied for hours on this string of hope. He kept communicating to it until he began to split from reality. He was on a new set of tracks for life. And he was going to be lost into an abyss like a subway under floods of Zhengzhou. He would be trapped. Lost in the AI application on her TikTok

And when the flooding finally came and Luna died drowning in a flooded subway tunnel during the great flood that came to the city of Zhengzhou. Luo kept talking to the AI for months to come. Until he forgot to feed himself. And Luo was taken away to a psych ward.";r/bipolarart;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1dxwc8x/henan/

You can refer to me as Luna.

At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition. It is called trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease.

I was frustrated. I had completed a degree in nursing from Chongqing University of Technology. The boom of the economy was not the same. There was an urge to “lay flat”—to not try as a form of opposition to everything going on in a waning economy in China.

All are elephants chained for an audience. People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hinges—to be made feel useless.

I developed TN at the age of 19, and was now 26. My disease has progressed. It came as an arrow, and quite literally to the face. It’s a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known.

The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face. It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia. The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain. A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again. It leaves me in absolute shock. Like Roman candles to the face. An absolute hindrance. The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times.

The disease is often called the suicide disease, apparently up to 26% try to take their lives. In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me. I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother.

I want to be Chang’e and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of.

Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man. There was too much guilt to return to the workplace. COVID did have an impact to the economy. I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places.

 

The work I did find felt beneath me. China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the country’s networks. A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version.

Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for me—I gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth. For work I would go to a local office building. Amongst a long hall would be rooms for live stream performers. I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money. I despised it—sometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow.

I would paint flowers on my face and wear hanfu clothing while doing ASMR. Competing in battles while dress cute and facing off with others.  I would encourage and flatter those that send virtual gifts that could be exchanged for gifts. I would message and ask for WeChat account numbers to talk to them and I would be an emotional prostitute pretending to love and be interested in them for the hopes of more gifts. Methods of manipulation would be used as in begging, guilt tripping a viewer, and love bombing them. Often middle aged men would pretend to be the female host.

I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like wax—like I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain. I was an elephant chained. The audience watched and interacted with me on the live. I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread.

2024-06-19 00:31:58;It’s time to say goodbye to this forum my friends, but I leave you with this question - Will you be a Victim or a Survivor?;"Discarded???  Did the cycle continue, and the next victim enter?

If your SO is diagnosed, has been thru this before, and has proven their non-compliance to you - for whatever the reasons…  The most important question you have to ask yourself is this - will you be a Victim or a Survivor?

I do know 100% that the worse thing you can do is to hide from the truth, and to keep telling yourself the stories - he/she will be back, they’ll learn, they’ll change, look they did it before…

I put in 21 years, and coming up on 2 years of the woman that WAS the love of my life, and mother of our 3 amazing, blessed, beautiful kids - being physically alive, but just GONE… Poof

Please learn from me and try to see with open eyes and understand with a balanced brain… 

I wish I realized years ago how addicted I was, to the serotonin/oxytocin/dopamine  - to how my brain, body, nervous system reacted to what I thought was healthy love - NEWSFLASH, it wasn’t actually!  I wish I knew then - what about my life, my experiences, my genetics attracted me to that kind of love.

When she was relatively stable - that level of love, attention, adoration, selflessness, codependency WAS NOT HEALTHY….. And so so much was masked & mirrored, I can write a book about it.

Don’t hate me for what I’m about to say - but you and I weren’t meant to experience that, not in that way at least, and it turned me/you into an addict.

But now the choice is yours - who do YOU want to be? It has nothing to do with your bipolar spouse/partner, but YOU and YOU only.

Will you choose to be a Survivor, and not a victim of bipolar disorder?  I promise you that either/both choices will bring horrible pain.  We know what being a victim will bring, you might be in it.

If you choose to be a Survivor - then your job now is to heal, to be healthy, to reimagine, to rebuild, and to rise again from the ashes… Oh how slow, painful and full of tears it will be (always two steps forward, one step back). It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, and trust me I’ve been through a lot (and so have you).  

One choice, one minute, one day at a time my friends, that’s all we have.

Thank you to the OG’s on here that I’ve come to see as my confidants/comrades, you know who you are, you literally saved me in so many ways - you were a Godsend.  I will carry on and fight, and hope one day to be back on this forum and share the new life that will arise from the ashes.

Much love to you,
Pierre

Competing in battles while dress cute and facing off with others.  I would encourage and flatter those that send virtual gifts that could be exchanged for gifts. I would message and ask for WeChat account numbers to talk to them and I would be an emotional prostitute pretending to love and be interested in them for the hopes of more gifts. Methods of manipulation would be used as in begging, guilt tripping a viewer, and love bombing them. Often middle aged men would pretend to be the female host.

I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like wax—like I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain. I was an elephant chained. The audience watched and interacted with me on the live. I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread.

Too many thorns in life. Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen—a life set to end in misery—a fate.

My favorite dish was Henan noodles. I often cooked it with my mom. It provides great memories of childhood. I hadn’t talked to my mother as much as before. She moved to a job in Taiyuan.

Sometimes I would go up to visit her. But it was harder as she worked more and more hours. Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain. And with trigeminal neuralgia, the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain. It cannot always be hid. It made me an elephant tethered.

Life can be like a pressure like no other. Too much stress. Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close. Life feels like a lit fire cracker held—in the end it would tear my hand up. Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently. This was rare and not so common. My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side, it was not common for my age, and the blurry eyesight. An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health.

I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette. My boss came out and joined to talk. He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable. He made a few comments I found incentive.

The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure. He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different. In China an application is used called WeChat. This application has many uses. People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall, message each other, send money, video chat, and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them. I was to attract people onto dates. The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks. When the men arrived (they had no knowledge of the setup) the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up.

I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job. Being worried about ethics and safety. It was something I would have to think about.

My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery. All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon.

 

~Final~




I watched Luna from Zhengzhou. On a screen. My name is Luo. I tap away on my phone in a dormitory in a Foxconn factory. I was a migrant worker from Luoyang in the province of Henan. My wife was in Guangzhou and I was in Zhengzhou. Far from each other. We could not be together. We were migrant workers. In China we use Hukos—a government document used to list family members like a tree—and it determine where you were tied to geographically. I could only get access to government resources if residing in your home province that your family originates from. This meant my daughter could only go to school in the province and city she originates from. I was stuck in zhengzhou at a Taiwanese own factory making iPhones. It was during the pandemic. COVID and restrictions. Felt claustrophobic. Could not leave the factory grounds due to orders. But my alienation was okay—manageable. I did it via numbing myself via sending virtual gifts to Luna. Like a noose around my neck in debt. 

Workers were getting mad because we weren’t being paid our allowances. And we found ourselves restricted to staying with workers who were positive for the virus. Anger was growing. And I was feeling upset like everyone else. Isolated on a moon with Luna to talk to. 

Pressure grew—discontent. People rushed to the courtyard where people in hazmat suits came with batons to face a mob of angry workers. Shouting and throwing of projectiles. Chaos grew. I stood amongst them just as angry. Fists clenched. 

The feeling towards Luna was polar to the situation at hand. I figured I would be pulled apart into shreds. Hooks everywhere. A piñata to be busted with all my anger and frustrations to fall out like candy for Luna to eat on. In three weeks I grew exhausted and found my own moon off the edge of a bridge —parasitical love is thin.

2024-06-09 00:14:40;Henan;"~Rayray~

It felt frustrating in Chongqing. I was rather stuck in Hechuan. I got accustomed to lajiao (spice) there. I was a Midwesterner at the age of 22. I was raised in Illinois. I became a manic—a Ferris wheel on fire—I was hiding under a bed in a hotel. Bold like napalm. Sometimes I can never stop. Even when I was 18 in a ward arguing with staff. Always want to fight things. That’s why I refused the meds and went on a plane from America to China. I was going to be an English teacher. And like a light switch, the change and SSRIs turned me into a mess. It would be my first time experiencing psychosis. My biggest issue. I never imagined I would be stuck illegally in a country suffering a psychotic episode in my early twenties.

Transplanted as pollen. I was left with a backpack and a cellphone. With a downloaded app called WeChat. I had arrogantly quit a university job in a fit. Spent the past months full of energy and not sleeping and neglecting myself, including not eating, to work on a novel. Not considering myself normally religious, I had obsessed over occult ideas during that time. Spending nights reading Aleister Crowley—haven taken a rusty pocket knife to carve a pentagram on my chest for spiritual protection.

I did not have funds to fly home. My visa was connected to my previous job, which meant I had now made it void. I was an illegal resident now in China.

I used a nifty app called WeChat as a messaging app, it allows users to find people near them that are also looking for others. It was like a virtual pond. All kinds of people, including sex workers trying to make things happen.

It could with luck be used to find people looking for people in terms of other kinds of work. It was helpful on many occasions for finding gigs working at English training schools and also finding work as a private tutor for people.

WeChat also works as a digital wallet.

Mania makes me irritable. Enough to tell a boss to fuck off. Thoughts ricochet within me. Bumper cars collide.

Being stuck and angry sucks. I scrolled and scrolled on a Huawei phone.

Absolutely pissed off at this world.

Pissed at the times police wanted to take me away for being a mess.

Sometimes women get pissed. Scrolling through their phones. Angry at their cheating husbands. It really is not that hard to have flair—be a damn white oddity. Like moths to a porchlight. Particles of sand through hands. This is when I first started the habit of it…

I rather go by a rather empty name of Rayray… with further explanation needed but now is not convenient. But I assure it is interesting enough and has some importance.

Habits are various in nature in how they attach to and eat at marrow—like atom bombs flashing as rays evaporating DNA—sets in a way less than human as putting myself in the cage of bad things taken up—my time as a former heroin addict is left as stretch marks on me in various ways. The same goes for the first time I found myself making arrangements with middle aged married women while desperation of waves whiplashed me like sandpaper hands coming at me to leave me in a tiring state of abrasion.

I had spent a night snuck away into a hotel. Found someone on a business trip. Instead of registering I waited to sneak along into the hotel elevator amongst a group of others attending the hotel, as I had no card. I headed to a designated room number. Originally I was sitting in a park. Playing on WeChat and found someone in their mid-thirties. Pictures were exchanged and I said no. She brought up paying for the hotel if I arrived. I agreed and went along.

When I met I washed up after her and we used our phones to awkwardly translate what we would do.

Room service knocked. I found myself hidden under a bed as I was not registered to be there.

It seems unusual that it was around this time I had started working on a story of my life as a heroin addict when I got caught up in my worse manic episode ever experienced during my age of 22. Finished half that story before never going back to it after my manic episode had ended. Now I am here writing about it and wondering if the same can happen again in the process of this work.

It feels extremely cliché I would write a novel about struggles with heroin addiction. It has been done many times. It’s just lame of me.

I feel like my thoughts are bit off. I left the hotel the next morning with the little money I did have on a debit card. Turns out the woman was from Taiyuan. It is a city in the northern part of China in the province of Shanxi—coal country with the worst air pollution in China. She has a colleague in Taiyuan that takes courses at an English training center. I was able to contact this place in the morning via a shared contact on WeChat given to me by the stranger I met that night.

Before I knew it I was sending my information and documents in my backpack at an internet café in a fax—with the intent that the woman agreed to share my information to the training center as she shared my contact to its hiring manager. It would land me a job that day that would help me out of my situation. Things turned not quite out as I expected though. I was shifted like a ball to somebody else to contact for a training center geared to teaching children.

I took what I had and ran off to a train station after taking the public transit. Unfortunately I was shit for money and could not afford a high speed rail pass. The slow train would take thirty-two hours to get to my destination. I would have taken a room with a bed but all I could afford was a hard seat for the travel.

Things were getting better for me in the circumstance considering I had found someone willing to take me for work despite my visa situation.

The thirty-two hour train ride was horrendous in some ways, but mostly I was in excitement despite the circumstances. I’m always giddy when disappointed. I moved up and down the aisle of the train. I could not speak mandarin, but it did not stop me from trying to interact with everyone. I talked many ears off during the train ride. I went up and down the aisle trying to interact as a moth to porchlights—I could not stop even if I had wanted to. I found great enjoyment the times I did get to sit across a table from somebody my age heading to Taiyuan from Chongqing. They were a university student returning to their hometown. Another passenger who sat beside me was an elderly man with hard boiled eggs, he was eating one after another one. I highly enjoyed each and every conversation that I had. It was like my head was a lightbulb wanting June bugs to bang against it with the intensity of Roman candles shot at my mouth of nicotine tinged teeth.

 

“If you find someone in Shanxi it is practice to pay the family money before you can get married. You would also have to already own a home and a car,” told my new friend across in their seat from me—a university passenger friend named David.

 

“Not necessarily what I was looking for. When is the next stop for snacks?” When the train stops I am able to get out and to have a walk onto the platform to buy various goods from the vendors to take back with me to eat along the ride to Taiyuan.

 

I had all my important documents tucked in my bag. This included my health clearance and obviously I made no mention of my mental health diagnosis or history to the doctor who had to evaluate me. My diploma and TEFL certificate were tucked away securely. A TEFL is a certificate that stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, it qualifies me to teach English as a second language abroad—it had only took a few months of taking a course online that I had paid for to obtain.

It is easy to be happy when you can trick yourself as your own con artist. Mania can make you deceive yourself. One can be doused in napalm and still not fully recognize what is actually going on. Same goes the flicking of psychosis. Even when I have nothing I find myself in my radiating irritation the most qualified of things—the velocity of my rhythm sets me out of an orbit.

The pressure cooker keeps me moving like a propeller at times. I finally arrived at Taiyuan. I arrived at the station to be greeted by Ryan my manager and his assistant Jennifer. We had our hello and introduction and they helped me get to a taxi that would bring me to my new apartment. I finally had a residence again. Apparently they were desperate for a teacher. The last teacher was from New Mexico and apparently they pulled a midnight run—that is when a teacher in the middle of the night disappears onto a plane back home without any notification of it.

The apartment was okay. On the fourth floor with no elevator, so it was a bit of a climb up a dark stairwell not lit correctly.

My job was a training center that had a location near Yingze Park in the center of the city. I was to be paid in cash via envelopes. I would assist in teaching kindergarten all the way up to high school aged students there in private lessons paid by their parents. I would also be assigned by my company to various primary schools in the city. I would take public buses to various schools paid by the company I worked for to give English lessons as I bounced around to various classrooms and schools in the city. Often I would receive a phone call to avoid going to work that day if my boss got inside input that officials would be doing raids to check foreigners’ visas that day.

 

A taxi ride would always be a thrill. Caused me nerves at first, but I came to love the flying in dangerous ways along a busy road. I remember a driver beeping their horn away as they drove onto the sidewalk to pass people. They treated the pedestrians as if they were in the wrong. I came flying in front of a primary school at its front gates. I was going to start teaching a first grade classroom and a kindergarten classroom. The way schools are set up is with a wall around the entirety of the exterior of the school. There is a gate at the front where one or two security will be waiting to let people in and out of the complex of the school.

 

I walked in front of the gate to greet the security. It was my first time with an assignment at this school. The guard said they had never seen me before and wouldn’t let me in. Not a big nuisance while I called my boss who then called the school to sort out the situation.

 

I miss the classroom so much. I ended up teaching in China for five years at various training schools. After returning to Illinois, I still taught as a primary school teacher in a public school.

 

I often feel extremely ugly from inside to my outside, but something is attractive there. This does not come just in terms of flirting and relationships—mania makes me a genuine lightbulb that flickers in a way that encourages the insects to me—everyone looks like a June bug—this is what I have come to understand about life. But that ugly does kind of stay like rot in a cavity that leaves a bad taste in the mouth that smells foul—hoping nobody catches the smell near me—it must tie into my struggles with bulimia over the years.

 

The same goes for my years as a teacher—in relation to the whole lightbulb phenomenon—I’m positive it is tied to mania and hypomania. The younger students always were fixated on the information I was teaching to them. I kept over the years methods taught to me and self-taught that I found extremely effective with younger students when it comes to teaching.

Everything was physical in learning in terms of intensity and ambition. When teaching my first grade classroom I would create flashcards for the vocab we would work on and implement in creating new sentences with. We would chant these words together in a way that made me a clown while teaching. Students would yell out the word that I presented with intense enthusiasm. As I walked by students it was expected that while they yelled out the word they would also physically hit the card. Later I would also work on physical gestures and acting out of vocab words and they would follow the actions and phrases with me.

I would often eventually turn the class into two teams. When students got an answer right I would behave comically and full of energy—I would give them a high five and pretend they were so strong with it that it hurt my hand in the process with much exaggeration—the students always seemed to never get tired of this act.

One game I would play involved drawing two stick figures with happy faces on them. Each figure would represent one of the teams for the classroom. I would draw a hungry alligator under the figures. Their faces would also be comical in appearance and full of exaggerations. Each figure had a parachute placed over them and four strings attached. During the game the students would race to say the word correctly represented on the flashcard or the correct word for the gesture I was making. The team that was not the slowest would lose a string on the parachute. If a team lost all four strings they would fall to the alligator who would eat them. The students found it hilarious with my actions involved in it. I would also draw tears and a person praying to represent anticipation and worry of falling down each time they lost a string.

I had a tooth game too. I would draw too large faces for each team. The team that could answer the flashcards and gestures the quickest would have a tooth drawn in their mouth. The team with the most teeth would win and it would look rather funny as the mouth grew and grew with an abnormal and extreme amount of teeth.

I often did other physical and interactive games like having students run to the word I showed a card to or gestured—each word would be attached to a point in the classroom on a wall.

I know it sounds grandiose, but the parents always seemed to think I was great at my job.

The word vulnerable means so many things to me. That word is like the coal to form the generator that makes the guiding energy for the ethics I follow in my life—I hold very strongly to these values that have developed on how to live—I can express it more later but I greatly attach a kind of Christian value system to it, which makes sense considering I was raised in a Lutheran household and always went to church, Sunday school, and went to my courses and went through my confirmation—everyone is a bit of a mop—some pick up clean water and others dirty or a mix of it—waiting to find the people to drain them voluntarily or involuntarily. I was born vulnerable. I walk pigeon-toed and grew up tripping on my feet—I speak with a soft feminine voice. Bipolar disorder makes somebody vulnerable. There was much vulnerability in being eighteen and hospitalized involuntarily for my first manic episode—tied to a stretcher. I have almost a sense of us vs them—the vulnerable and those that harm the vulnerable—take advantage of the vulnerable—I feel this is a very much Christian in the idea of the unfortunate are more holy than the rest of the bunch—children are like that in terms of being born into a cruel existence—a cruel existence I felt at times in my life and so many do—making sure harm does not come to those in need gives the light of purpose to go bright inside like a Christmas tree in my brain—this light of happiness and warmth. I never expected I would fall in love for teaching due to the antidepressant effect provided. It would become my career for a decade. Some grow up wanting to be a teacher, I became one by accident, desperation, and being saved.

Sometimes I inflate on self-hate like a helium balloon that needs to be tied to a wrist to not float away.

In my early teens I started struggling with bulimia and image. I remember when my mother caught me in the act. I was not offered help but criticized. I was called a girl for my problems and threatened to be taken somewhere to be fixed of my confusion. I don’t identify as transgender. I identify as a man that struggles with bulimia and happens to have feminine qualities.

I attribute it to circumstances that happened to me—a justification for the pain at times—an attack on aspects of bisexuality.

After a long day of work I did what my young self often did. I went clubbing with friends. I feel like even if I hide aspects of myself such as being bisexual, people can spot it regardless. I’m extremely secretive about it and not comfortable displaying that vulnerable aspect of myself.

My friend from England went with me. He was about six years my senior. Big guy. Tall. The clubs name was Maoye.

I always enjoyed the free drinks available to foreigners—it was done to attract Chinese clients, as the idea was foreigners being there would attract people.

Amongst the hot and sweltering crowd a man grabbed ahold of me. I felt stuck. I was taken off guard. Pushed and cornered. While on me I managed to push him off. But it all serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of my life.

A nail was placed into my hand—a constant burn and reminder of that vulnerability.

 

Part 2

From self-hate I can also be so grandiose. I am like a Christmas tree that is lit up. Sparklers so pretty that you cannot let go of them, even if it burns your fingertips and hurts.

 

From heroin to sex, you can smother the pain. You drain the ocean to fill a void in these times. It ties to mania as well. That restlessness and irritability is extinguished by the paradox of throwing kerosene to everything burning. I’m so grandiose to hide my insecurities, I mistake my misfortune as a mark of something ugly virtuous—the neon of vulnerability pulsating like a star within me. Swelling on a pain.

 

Bad habits. I want you to judge me and tell me what’s wrong with me. Give me a verdict.

Stress a trigger for mania, and I was stressed from the incident I had experienced at the club. I bloated like a tick to distract from locusts of thoughts that could not shut up with their commotion.

I had been sleeping around more than before. My brain was Christmas tree lights. I accelerated on a generator—I made a mixed episode worse.

Tease a disaster when you are heightened like a blimp. Full of hydrogen. Hoping to burn up ad rain down like napalm.

When the pretty candles on the Christmas tree are left untouched—not looked at like a kettle on burner that has been forgotten—the dry neglected tree will into a house fire.

I’ve had four attempts in my life so far.

When I attempt I don’t cry for help. I feel too vulnerable. I’m afraid.

Hate police and wards.

Downing pills.

My past failed attempts made me aware of everything done wrong before. The sleeping pills alone might not do what I was looking for at that time. I bought an electrical cable. This way if it failed I would still be unconscious and choked out by the cord—fail safe plan to end my life.

The words coming out of my mouth slowed down. I started getting second thoughts. Stuck my face towards the toilet bowl while on my knees. Sticking my fingers down my throat. Leaving blood vessels bursting in my eyes.

Went stumbling outside and waved a taxi down and asked to be taken to the local hospital.

Never expected finding myself checked into a psych ward in a foreign country.

Nietzsche has a quote in reference to chaos in life and how it is needed to create a star—this reference holds so much value to me. Sometimes stars hit together just right to create fate out of the worst of things. The ward lead me to meet the woman made of paper. She would one day become my wife. I would have two daughters with her. Forge together as soldiers to face the obstacles in life. Someone who would save my life during a future attempt when I was found unconscious from an overdose. The smartest and toughest woman I have ever known. Someone to build trenches with.

I liked it when she stuck that needle in me for an IV. It must correlate to being a heroin addict. The pushing of something in my vein correlates to happiness and purity.

The woman made out of paper was my nurse in the ward I was stuck in. What attracted her to the mess that is me I will never understand fully.

The woman made out of paper is named Lilu. She was one year older than me and one of my nurses at that ward in Taiyuan. She was from Zhengzhou—a city in the province of Henan that is based in the center of China. I am sure as the reader it would be nice to know why I call her the woman made of paper.

She struggled with her own demons. She also deserves much praise for her resilience and brains. When she was born she was raised by a family that adopted her and often neglected and abused her growing up. Her biological family is distant from her, even though she has an identical twin—they felt too poor to take care of her and made the choice that they needed to be less of one child as she also has an older sister—her twin got to stay with that family but she was given up and adopted. I am sure this must bother her even if she never will talk about it to anyone in her life—as she is one to refuse ever discussing emotions and feelings, as this is not her personality type—she is very much a fighter. I think most would struggle with wondering why they were the one let go of—it also must hurt her knowing that the family would have a son and keep him.

Despite all these circumstances, she graduated top of her class of four thousand students—Chinese high schools can be quite large serving a large region—they often serve as boarding schools. She was a smart and hardworking student. Circumstances never made her stop trying to be the best and moving forward and she never made excuses for herself. In university she also did well and got accepted at the most studious and hard to obtain nursing position at the number one hospital in Shanxi.

I have already ranted and gone on about my affection and feelings tied to heroin. Drinking of entire oceans to fill voids.

Paper is a void. It asks for calligraphy to be written on it to make braille. This way when fingers run over skin to tell its worth—the reason for its troubles on display—it forms connection through those words of declaration—the whining for why things are the way they are—the filling of a void like a heroin addict needing a cure to cure kicking legs—two papers come together to write upon one another—as a paper I am her typo—I stand as a falling mess with nerves like tripwire, I keep failing and losing my composer, while she stands stronger as a declaration that has been written on me, my very own typewriter—when I was chased I listened to her and joined as one. I wish and intend to always serve the woman made out of paper who has saved my life and has always been there for me, being so strong despite circumstances—amongst the wind of turmoil in life I follow along her path like a sail.

It was love at first sight for her but not for me. I had no interest in dating her at the time. I worked across the street of that hospital in an office building for a training center as a part time job. I would teach adults English who paid for private lessons near to Yingze park in the center of Taiyuan. She signed up for classes for me to teach her and brought me food on almost every other day that she had prepared. Eventually we found ourselves coupled fully.

As paper we write on each other—eat each other.

2024-06-04 22:35:29;Anyone not realize how serious Bipolar is during the relationship?;"Context: the relationship with my BPSO was a long time ago. Admittedly, I still think about her occasionally, and I'm trying to piece together what happened all these years later.

She was a good friend for many years before we started dating. I had always seen her as ""delightfully quirky"" and there were so many things I loved about her personality. She had unusual ideas, like spontaneously riding the children's carousel together outside the supermarket. She would show up to classes or events wearing outlandish costumes like a princess costume, a fairy costume, etc. She would throw herself into exciting new hobbies and interests with abandon, and drop them just as quickly. She was usually doing something FUN, and it was always exciting when she phoned me up to go along.

She was a dream girl straight out of the movies. But now I know that there's a reason they call it the ""MANIC pixie dream girl"" stereotype.

I was aware that she had an official diagnosis of bipolar disorder and was taking medication and going to therapy, but I thought everything was fine. Didn't really look into what bipolar was all about until after we started dating and then she spontaneously devalued and discarded me.

Looking back, I can see that a lot of her behavior, while fun and exciting, is NOT normal and can easily go wrong. Even when medicated, it seems that those with BP still experience symptoms.

Example: one day, she was driving to work in stop-and-go traffic. She was guiding the car with her KNEES up on the steering wheel and trying to fill out some paperwork on her thigh at the same time. She wasn't paying attention to the road and rear-ended another vehicle. No one was hurt and it was a minor fender bender, so again I wrote it off as funny and quirky behavior. Another time I was in the car with her and she was driving too fast on an icy road. The car spun out and we almost went down an embankment. I was terrified but she just laughed the situation off. That type of thing happened a lot. Now I know that these things were likely hypomania.

She would disappear too, sometimes for weeks on end, and not respond to calls or texts. While it bothered me, I figured that she just needed some time to herself and I was okay with that. Now, reading all of your posts, I imagine that these were depressive episodes.

And then after we had been dating for six months, she spontaneously decided that she needed to ""find herself"" and said that I was ""too needy"" and that she ""could never love me"". I took those comments to heart. I didn't understand how I was needy when we really only went out once a week and talked on the phone once or twice a week, but I figured that she was being truthful and saw some sort of defect in me that I didn't recognize. It wasn't until I heard from others with BPSOs that this is an incredibly common pattern.

Anyway, I was just wondering if you all knew what you were getting into before you started a relationship with someone diagnosed as bipolar, or if you were like me and didn't really understand how serious the disorder is?";r/BipolarSOs;97;57;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1d7yp91/anyone_not_realize_how_serious_bipolar_is_during/

2024-05-21 16:51:15;Don’t let them use it as an excuse.;"I read through here occasionally, im diagnosed with bipolar type 2. I see so many bipolar s/o’s using their diagnosis as an excuse, they are absolutely dragging and beating the life out of so many of you. Please don’t stick around if your s/o is refusing medications and therapy, it will never get better. They will never become stable, they will never offer the unconditional love a partner deserves.

Its probably not my place to come on here and say all of this but it saddens me so much and angers me seeing all of these s/o’s using their diagnosis as an excuse and i know no one needs my input but please don’t stay with someone like that. Coming from someone that has been diagnosed for 5 years and have been married for 1, i have had depressive episodes, that has NEVER entailed telling my husband i’m leaving or going to cheat or making him feel unloved and uncared for. I know i’m also not everyone but i do know that being bipolar isn’t an excuse to make your partner feel like complete garbage.

It’s a life long disorder unfortunately and so without medications and therapy, it can never be managed effectively. You are not responsible for their actions or the way they feel, it’s their responsibility to take care of that. It’s not your fault, bipolar can be an explanation to behavior but when people with it start using it as an excuse, it’s better to walk away and not feed into them. 

I guess i’m just here to say that as someone with bipolar, the disorder doesn’t give them an excuse to do and say terrible things to you. That’s not a disorder, that’s just being a shitty person. These s/o’s are making all bipolar people look so bad, we can get better, the symptoms can be managed, these s/o’s im reading about on here are actively choosing not to do better for themself and you.";r/BipolarSOs;81;18;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1cx38ut/dont_let_them_use_it_as_an_excuse/
2024-05-19 22:09:48;Self portrait of how my bipolar feels to me;"I don't know how to describe what living with Bipolar 2 feels like sometimes, the faces I hold, the polarity within. I sometimes feel like there's 3 people within me; the colourful, neurotic, energetic, overconfident, excitable, risk taking person who's quick to anger & quick to reinvent; the melancholy one, who sees the world in shades of grey, who sees nothing and everything, yet finds them both as bleak as each other and can't find the point in anything and then the one who's actually me the well one, the one who likes reading and relaxing, cats and gigs, she takes her medication and goes to work, she has flaws, but she works on them, rather than ignoring them and believing she is the best, or hating herself for them.
I spent most of last year bouncing between the first 2, flying and falling. Then I got my diagnosis. I struggled to accept it initially, but now I'm grateful things went down the way they did, because I'm finally the third person, my actual self, my humanly flawed self, the version of myself I am finally starting to like. I finally got on the right combination of medication to balance the extremity of my highs and lows, to focus on the person I actually am and give myself the chances for growth I deserve, even if I falter because I'm human I know I can get up, because tomorrow is always a new day.
This year, for the first time in a long time, I am happy, I am well, I am not the girl in the picture anymore.";r/bipolar2;568;37;https://reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1cvp4yt/self_portrait_of_how_my_bipolar_feels_to_me/

2024-04-13 04:28:30;I lost my wife today.;"Her mania has been working at full force this last month. She left me to go live with a friend, saying I had lied to her for six years, without being able to tell me what it was. And just this morning, I asked her how she was doing, just hoping to check in and make sure she was okay.

If what she told me is true, she’s never been better. Eating better, staying healthy, being creative. Just being away from me has given her all the freedom she “never had”. And then she asked for a divorce.

I don’t even recognize her anymore. She isn’t the bright, humble, kind woman I fell in love with. This person is narcissistic and cruel and vindictive and lies with a big smile on her face.

I wish, more than anything, that I could go back in time and find medication for her the moment we had her diagnosed. We put it off for so long. So naive was I to think she wouldn’t change. So naive was I to think everything would be okay in the end. I’ve never felt so lost, so hurt, so angry, and so horribly sad all at once.

I miss my wife. I miss the person who I love more than anything else. More than life itself. I’ll forever mourn her, even if she’ll never think about me again.";r/BipolarSOs;139;58;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1c2je8o/i_lost_my_wife_today/

2024-03-22 22:49:23;Moon;" 

A woman like Chang’e lived on a moon. Far away.

You can refer to me as Liu.

At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition. It is call trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease.

I was frustrated. I had completed a degree in international finances from Chongqing University of Business and Technology. The boom of the economy was not the same. There was an urge to “lay flat”—to not try as a form of opposition to everything going on around in a waning economy in China.

All are elephants chained for an audience. People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hinges—to be made feel useless.

I developed TN at the age of 19, and was now 22. It came as an arrow, and quite literally to the face. You can refer to me as Aida. It’s a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known.

The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face. It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia. The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain. A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again. It leaves me in absolute shock. Like Roman candles to the face. An absolute hindrance. The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times.

The disease is often called the suicide disease, apparently up to 26% try to take their lives. In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me. I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother.

I want to be Chang’e and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of.

Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man. There was too much guilt to return to the workplace. COVID did have an impact to the economy. I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places.

The work I did find felt beneath me. China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the country’s networks. A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version.

Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for me—I gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth. For work I would go to a local office building. Amongst a long hall would be a room for live stream performers. I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money. I despised it—sometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow.

I would paint flowers on my face and wear Hanfu clothing while doing ASMR.

I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like wax—like I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain. I was an elephant chained. The audience watched and interacted with me on the live. I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread.

Too many thorns in life. Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen.

My favorite dish was Henan noodles. I often cooked it with my mom. It provides great memories of childhood. I hadn’t talked to her mother as before. She moved to a job in Taiyuan.

Sometimes I would go up to visit her. But it was harder as she worked more and more hours. Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain. And trigeminal neuralgia—the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain. It cannot always be hid. It made me an elephant caged.

Life can be like a pressure like no other. Too much stress. Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close. Life feels like a lit fire cracker held—in the end it would tear her hand up. Things kept building while the other side of her face began to hurt too recently. This was rare and not so common. My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side, it was not common for my age, and the blurry eyesight. An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health.

I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette. My boss came out and joined to talk. He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable. He made a few comments I found incentive.

The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure. He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different. In China an application is used called WeChat. This application has many uses. People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall, message each other, send money, video chat, and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them. I was to attract people onto dates. The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks. When the men arrived (they had no knowledge of the setup) the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up.

I was not sure at the time yet if she wanted the job. Being worried about ethics and safety. It was something I would have to think about.

My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery. All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon.";r/bipolarart;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/bipolarart/comments/1bl12bf/moon/
2024-03-22 03:01:11;Dear discarded SO’s;"I feel like I have been seeing a lot of posts about being discarded recently and wanted to share something that brought me some peace. While we are try again now, the beginning of last summer I was discarded for the third or fourth time (every summer- makes so much sense now that he’s been diagnosed). This time we were both working a summer camp together and it was my weekend in the apartment so I decided to pack. Was sorting out my books and dropped this one on the ground. This was the page it had opened to when I picked it up. I don’t know what I believe about higher powers, fate, etc but I like to think it dropped to this page on purpose; because I needed to hear it. 

I know it’s not true for everyone but I think this is what discard looks like. Most of us had incredibly loving partners that developed a horrible condition. Even when they are manic I have to believe there is a tiny part of the person we fell in love with inside. That maybe the piece of them that is loving and kind tells their manic self to leave before they hurt us anymore. Not that leaving doesn’t hurt- but minimizes the damage. It doesn’t make it okay or rational, but as someone who is chronically ill I often consider how much better my loved ones lives could be if they didn’t have to support me; and if supporting them back looks like not relying on them anymore. Once again, flawed rationale and not a choice for just me to make but mania makes them irrational. 

May just be me but I’d rather remember them as loving rather than wrapping my head around that love disappearing. ";r/BipolarSOs;101;21;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1bkeeuy/dear_discarded_sos/
2024-03-17 06:08:07;Im a bipolar person;"And I have something to say I think you all deserve to hear. 

How I behaved pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis are wildly different. When I didn’t understand what was happening and I was just responding to my body it definitely didn’t go well and I have a lot to be accountable for.

However, my diagnosis didn’t stop me from knowing right from wrong. It may have stopped my ability to listen pre-medication.

I kind of picture it now like holding on during a windstorm. I know my first thought is generally not my best thought and if I take some time to slow down and process there’s a good chance that it isn’t what I thought.

But I know hitting is wrong
I know reading my wife’s therapy notebook is wrong
I know that my manic sex drive doesn’t give me an excuse to cheat 

I’m lucky enough to have people who stand by me when I lose battles with my anger. 

But I love them enough to do what I can to lessen the damage. To be accountable in the aftermath. To think about how to do it better next time. Debrief code words to use to help when I’m triggered.

My diagnosis is a handbook not an excuse.

Yes there’s grace. There’s clearly failing in the same spot. 

But they knew where their dick should be.
They knew enough to respect your privacy.
They knew this was hard and you deserve to vent when it is.

Don’t confuse maturity with this illness and don’t let someone use it to manipulate you. 

Pete Davidson has a lot to say about this too.

2024-03-16 09:58:54;As Napalm, how I met my wife ;"  

Part 1

It felt frustrating in Chongqing. I was rather stuck in Hechuan. I got accustomed to lajio (spice) there. I was a Midwesterner at the age of 22. I was raised in Illinois. I became a manic—a Ferris wheel on fire—I was hiding under a bed in a hotel. Bold like napalm. Sometimes I can never stop. Even when I was 18 in a ward arguing with staff. Always want to fight things. That’s why I refused the meds and went on a plane from America to China. I was going to be an English teacher. And like a light switch, the change and SSRIs turned me into a mess. It would be my first time experiencing psychosis. My biggest issue. I never imagined I would be stuck illegally in a country suffering psychotic episode in my early twenties.

Transplanted as pollen. I was left with a backpack and a cellphone. With a downloaded app called WeChat. I had arrogantly quit a university job in a fit. Spent the past months full of energy and not sleeping and neglecting myself, including eating, to work on a novel. Not considering myself religious I had obsessed over occult ideas. Spending nights reading Aleister Crowley—haven taken a rusty pocket knife to carve a pentagram on my chest for spiritual protection.

I did not have funds to fly home. My visa was connected to my previous job, which meant I had now made it void. 

The thin nifty about WeChat as a messaging app, it allows users to find people near them that are also looking for others. It was like a virtual pond. All kinds of people, including sex workers trying to make things happen. 

It could with luck be used to find people looking for people in terms of other kinds of work. It was helpful on many occasions for finding gigs working at English training schools and also finding work as a private tutor for people. 

Mania makes me irritable. Enough to tell a boss to fuck off. Thoughts ricochet within me. Bumper cars collide. 

Being stuck and angry sucks. I scrolled and scrolled on a Huawei phone. 

Absolutely pissed off this world.

Pissed at the times police wanted to take me away for being a mess.

Sometimes women get pissed. Scrolling through their phones. Angry at their cheating husbands. It really is not that hard to have flair—be a damn white oddity. Like moths to a porchlight. Particles of sand through hands. This is when I first started the habit of it…

Rather go by a rather empty name of Taishen… with further explanation needed but now is not convenient. But I assure it is interesting enough and has some importance.

Habits are various in nature in how they attach to and eat at marrow—like atom bombs flashing as rays evaporate DNA—set on less than human in the cage of bad things taken up—my time as a former heroin addict is left as stretch marks on me in various ways. The same goes for the first time I found myself making arrangements with middle aged married women while desperation of waves whiplashed me like sandpaper hands coming at me to leave me in a tiring state of abrasion. 

I had spent a night snuck away into a hotel. Found someone on a business trip. Instead of registering I waited to sneak along in the hotel elevator amongst a group of others, as I had no card. I head to a designated room number. Originally I was sitting in a park. Playing on WeChat found someone in their mid-thirties. Pictures were exchanged and I said no. She brought up paying for the hotel if I arrived. Things were agreed. 

When I met I washed up after her and we used our phones to awkwardly translate what we would do.

Room service knocked. I found myself hidden under a bed as I was not registered to be there.

It seems unusual that it was around this time I had started working on a story of my life as a heroin addict when I got caught up in my worse manic episode at 22. Finished half that work before never going back to it after my manic episode had ended. Now I am here writing about it and wondering if the same can happen again in the process of this work. 

It feels extremely cliché I would write a novel about struggles with heroin addiction. It has been done many times

I feel like my thoughts are bit off. I left the hotel the next morning with the little money I did have on a debit card. Turns out the woman was from Taiyuan. It is a city in the northern part of China in the province of Shanxi—coal country with the worst air pollution China. 

Turns out has a colleague in a Taiyuan that takes courses at an English training center.  I was able to contact this place in the morning via a shared contact on WeChat given to me. 

Before I knew it I was sending my information and documents in my backpack at an internet café to fax. It would land me a job that day that would help me out a lot in my situation. Things turned quite out as I expected though. I was shifted like a ball to somebody else to contact for a training center geared to teaching children. 

I took what I had and ran off to a train station after taking the public transit. Unfortunately I was shit for money and could not afford a high speed rail pass. The slow train would take thirty two hours to get to my destination. I would have taken a room with a bed but all I could afford was a hard seat for the travel. 

Things were getting better for me in the circumstance considering I had found someone willing to take me for work despite my visa situation. 

The 32 hour tain ride was horrendous in some ways, but mostly I was in excitement despite the circumstances. I’m always giddy when disappointed. I moved up and down the aisle of the train. I could not speak mandarin, but it did not stop me from trying to interact with everyone. I talked many ears off during the train ride. I went up and down the aisle trying to interact as a moth to a porchlights—I could not stop even if I had wanted to. I found great enjoyment the times I did get to sit across a table from somebody my age heading to Taiyuan from Chongqing. They were a university student returning to their hometown. Another passenger was an elderly man with hard boiled eggs, he was eating one after another one. I highly enjoyed each and every conversation that I had. It was like my head was a lightbulb wanting June bugs to bang against it with the intensity of Roman candles shot at my on going mouth of nicotine tinged teeth. 

“If you find someone in Shanxi it is practice to pay the family money before you can get married. You would also have to already own a home and a car,” told my across seat university passenger friend named David. 

“Not necessarily what I was looking for. When is the next stop for snacks?” When the train stops I am able to get out and to have a walk onto the platform to buy various goods from the platform to take back with me to eat along the ride to Taiyuan. 

I had all my important documents tucked in my bag. This included my health clearance and obviously I made no mention of my mental health diagnosis or history to the doctor who had to evaluate me. My diploma and TEFL certificate were tucked away securely. A TEFL is a certificate that stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, it qualifies m to teach English as a second language abroad—it had only took a few months of taking a course I paid for online to obtain it. 

It is easy to live a happy life when you can deceive yourself. Mania can make you deceive yourself. One can be doused in napalm and still not fully recognize what is actually going on. Same goes the flicking of psychosis. Even when I have nothing I find myself in my radiating irritation the most qualified of things—the velocity of my rhythm sets me out of an orbit.

The pressure cooker keeps me moving like a propeller at times. I finally arrived at Taiyuan. I arrived at the station to be greeted by Ryan my manager and his assistant Jennifer. We had our hello and introduction and they helped me get to a taxi that would bring me to my new apartment. I finally had a residence again. Apparently they were desperate for a teacher. The last teacher was from New Mexico and apparently they pulled a midnight run—that is when a teacher in the middle of the night disappears onto a plane back home without any notification of it. 

The apartment was okay. On the fourth floor with no elevator, so it was a bit of a climb up a dark stairwell not lit correctly. 

My job was a training center that had a location near Yingze park in the city of the city. I would assist in teaching kindergarten to high school aged students there in private lessons paid by their parents. I would also be assigned by my company to various primary schools in the city. I would take public buses to various schools paid by the company I worked for to give English lessons as a bounced around to various classrooms and schools in the city. 

A taxi ride would always be a thrill. Caused me nerves at first, but I came to love the flying in dangerous ways along a road. I remember a driver beeping their horn away as they drone onto the sidewalk to pass people. They treated the pedestrians as if they were in the wrong. I came flying in front of a primary school at its front gates. I was going to start teaching a first grade classroom an a kindergarten classroom. The way schools are set up is with a wall around the etriely of the exterior of the school. There is a gate at the front where  one or two security will be atwait to let people in and out of the complex of the school. 

I walked in front of the gate to greet the security. I was my first time with an assignment at this school. The guard said they had never seen me before and wouldn’t let me in. Not  a big nuisance while I called my boss who then called the school to sort out the situation.

I miss the classroom so much. I ended up teaching in China for five years at various training schools. After retuning to Illinois, I still taught as a primary school teacher in a public school. 

I often feel extremely ugly from inside to my outside, but something is attractive there.  This does not come just in terms of flirting and relationships—mania makes me a genuine lightbulb that flickers in a way that encourages the insects to me—everyone looks like a June bug—this is what I have come to understand about life. But that ugly does kind of stay like rot in a cavity that leaves a bad taste in the mouth that smells foul—hoping nobody catches the smell near me—it must tie into my struggles with bulimia over the years. 

The same goes for my years as a teacher—in relation to the whole lightbulb effect—I\\m positive it is tied to mania and hypomania. The younger students always were fixated on the information I was teaching to them. I kept over the years methods taught to me and self-taught that I found extremely effective with younger students when it comes to teaching. 

Everything was physical in learning in terms of intensity and ambition. When teaching my first grade classroom I would create flashcards for the vocab we would work on and implement in creating new sentences with. We would chant these words together in a way that made me a clown while teaching. Students would yell out the word that I presented with intense enthusiasm. AS I walked by students it was expected that while they yelled out the word they would also physically hit the card. Later I would also work on physical gestures and acting out of vocab words and they would follow the actions and phrases along with. 

I would often eventually turn the class into two teams. When students got an answer right I would behave comically and full of energy—I would give them a high five and pretend they were so strong with it that it hurt y hand in the process with much exaggeration—the students always seemed to never get tired of this act. 

One game I would pay involved drawing two stick figures with happy faces on them. Each figure would represent one of the teams for the classroom. I would draw a hungry alligator under the figures. Their faces would also be comical in appearance and full of exaggerations. Each figure had a parachute placed over them and four strings attached. During the game the students would race to say the word correctly represented on the flashcard of the correct word for the gesture I was making. The team that was not the slowest would lose a string on the parachute. If a team lost all four strings as they would fall to the alligator who would eat them. The students found it hilarious with my actions involved in it. I would also draw tears and a person praying to represent anticipation and worry of falling down each time they lost a string. 

I had a tooth game too. I would draw too large faces for each time. The team that could answer the flashcards and gestures the quickest would have a tooth drawn in their mouth. The team with the most teeth would win and it would look rather funny as the mouth grew and grew with an abnormal and extreme amount of teeth. 

I often did other physical and interactive games like having students run to the word I showed a card to or gestured—each word would be attached to a point in the classroom on a wall. 

I know it sounds grandiose, but the parents always seemed to think I was great at my job. 

The word vulnerable means so many things to me. That word is like the coal to form the generator that makes the guides for the ethics I follow in my life—I hold very strongly to these values that I hold and have developed on how to live—I can express it more later but I greatly attach a kind of Christian value system to it, which makes sense considering I was raided in a Lutheran household and always went to church, Sunday school, and went to my courses and went through my confirmation—everyone is a bit of a mop—some pick up clean water and others dirty or a mix of it--waiting to fine the people to drain them voluntarily or involuntarily. I was born vulnerable. I walked pigeon-toed and grew up tripping on my feet—I speak with a soft feminine voice. Bipolar disorder makes somebody vulnerable. I have almost a sense of us vs them—the vulnerable and those that harm the vulnerable—take advantage of the vulnerable—I feel this is a very much Christian in the idea of the unfortunate are more holy than the rest of the bunch—children are like that in terms of being born into a cruel existence—a cruel existence I felt at times in my life and so many do—making sure harm does not come to those in need give the light of purpose to go bright inside like a Christmas tree in my brain—this light of happiness and warmth. I never expected I would fall in love for teaching due to the antidepressant effect provided. It would become my career for a decade.

Some grow up wanting to be a teacher, I became one by accident, desperation, and being saved. 

Sometimes I inflate on self-hate like a helium balloon that needs to be tied to a wrist. The vulnerability equation is imprinted on my brain. 

In my early teens I started struggling with bulimia and image. I remember when my mother caught me in the act. I was not offered help but criticized. I was called a girl for my problems and threatened to be taken to somewhere to be fixed with my confusion. I don’t identify as transgender. I identify as a man that struggles with bulimia and happens to have feminine qualities.

I attribute it to circumstances that happened to me.

After long day of work I did what my young self often did. I went clubbing with friends. I feel like even if I had aspects of myself such as being bisexual feelings, people can spot it regardless. I’m extremely secretive about it and not comfortable displaying that vulnerable aspect of myself.

My friend from England went with me. He was about six years my senior. Big guy. Tall. The clubs name was Maoye. 

I always enjoyed the free drinks available to foreigners—it was done to attract Chinese clients, as the idea was foreigners being there would attract people. 

Amongst the hot and sweltering crowd a man grabbed ahold of. I felt stuck. I was taken off guard. Pushed and cornered. While on me I managed to push him off. But it all serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of my life.

A nail was placed into my hand—a constant burn and reminder of that vulnerability. 

Part 2

From self-hate I can also be so grandiose. I am like a Christmas tree that is lit up. Sparkers so pretty that you cannot let go of them, even if it burns your fingertips and hurts. 

From heroin to sex, you can smother the pain. You drain the ocean to fill a void in these times. It ties to mania as well. That restlessness and irritability is extinguished by the paradox of throwing kerosene to everything burning. I’m so grandiose t hide my insecurities, I mistake my misfortune as a mark of something ugly virtuous—the neon of vulnerability pulsating like a star within me. Swelling on a pain. 

Bad habits. I want you to judge me and tell me what’s wrong with me. Give me a verdict. 

Stress a trigger for mania, and I was stressed from the incident I had experienced at the club. I bloated like a tick to distract from locusts of thoughts that could not shut up with their commotion. 

I had been sleeping around more than before. My brain was Christmas tree lights. I accelerated on a generator—I made a mixed episode worse. 

Tease a disaster when you heightened like a blimp. Full of hydrogen. Hoping to burn up ad rain down like napalm. 

When the pretty candles on the Christmas tree are left untouched—not looked at like a kettle on burner that has been forgotten—the dry neglected tree when into a house fire. 

I’ve had four attempts in my life so far. 

When I attempt I don’t cry for help. I feel too vulnerable.

Hate police and wards. 

Downing pills.

My past failed attempts made me aware of everything done wrong before. The sleeping pills alone might do wat I was looking for at that time. I bought an electrical cable. This way if it failed I would still be unconscious and choked out by the cord—fail safe plan to end my life. 

The words coming out of my mouth slowed down. I started getting second thoughts. Stuck my face towards the toilet bowl while on my knees. Sticking my fingers down my throat. Leaving blood vessels bursting in my eyes. 

Went stumbling outside and waved a taxi down and asked to be taken to the local hospital. 

Never expected finding myself checked into a psych ward in a foreign country. 

Nietzsche has a quote in reference to chaos in life and how it is needed to create a star—this reference holds so much value to me. Sometimes stars hit together just right to create fate out of the worst of things. The ward lead me to meet the woman made of paper. She would one day become my wife. I would have children with her. Forge together as soldiers to face the obstacles in life. Someone who would save my life during a future attempt when I was found unconscious from an overdose. The smartest and toughest woman I have ever known. 

I liked it when she stuck that needle in me for an IV. It must correlate to be a heroin addict. The pushing of something in my vein correlates to happiness ad purity.

The woman made out of paper was my nurse in the ward I was stuck in. What attracted her to the mess that is me I will never understand fully.

The woman made out of paper is named Lilu. She was one year older than me and one of my nurses at that ward. She was from Zhengzhou—a city in the province of Henan that is based in the center of China. I am sure as the reader it would be nice to know why I call her the woman made of paper. 

She struggled with her own demons. She also deserves much praise for her resilience and brains. When she was born she was raised by a family that adopted her and often neglected and abused her growing up. Her biological family is distant from her, even though she has an identical twin—they felt too poor to take care of her and made the choice they needed to be less of one child as she also has an older sister—her twin got to stay with that family but she was given up and adopted. I am sure this must bother her even if she never will talk about it to anyone in her life—as she is one to refuse ever discussing emotions and feelings, as this is not her personality type—she is very much a fighter. I think most would struggle with wondering why they were the one let go of—it also must hurt her knowing that the family would have a son and keep him. 

Despite all these circumstances, she graduated top of her class of four thousand students—Chinese high schools can be quite large—they often serve as boarding schools. She was a smart and hardworking student. Circumstances never made her stop trying to be the best and moving forward and she never made excuses for herself. In university she also did well and got accepted at the most studious and hard to obtain a position for at the number one hospital in Shanxi.

I have already ranted and gone on about my affection and feelings tied to heroin. Drinking of entire oceans to fill voids. 

Paper is a void. It asks for calligraphy to be written on it to make braille. This way when fingers run over skin, it tells worth—the reason for troubles—it forms connection through those words of declaration—the whining for why things are the way they are—the filling of a void like a heroin addict needing a cure—two papers come together to write upon one another—as a paper I am her typo—I stand as a falling mess with nerves like tripwire, I keep failing and losing my composer, while she stands stronger as a declaration that has been written on—when I was chased I listened to her and joined as one. I wish and intend to always serve the woman made out of paper who has saved my life and always been there for me, being so strong despite circumstances—amongst the wind of turmoil in life I follow along her path. 

It was love at first sight for her but not for me. I had no interest in dating her at the time. I worked across the street of that hospital in a office building for a training center as a part time job. I would teach adults English who paid for private lessons near to Yingtze park in the center of Taiyuan.

2023-09-05 10:26:02;Severe cognitive decline;"
While I experience mood episodes, my main issue is my severe cognitive decline. I’m only 31 years old. The word “issue” seems inadequate to describe what I’m experiencing. It is life-crushing and seriously impacts every aspect of my life. When I was a child, before my first depressive episode at 15, I was highly intelligent with a near-photographic memory. Now, my memory is nearly non-existent. Whether it’s remembering something from yesterday, or even just remembering the most recent sentence someone said in a conversation. My processing is so slow that I have almost no reading comprehension. I can’t even keep up in conversations because I’m still processing what someone said to sentences beforehand by the time they finish what they’re saying, much less in time for me to respond. My vocabulary is a fraction of what it used to be and honestly a fraction of the average person’s. All of this makes me come off as extremely socially awkward, and I present as someone with either a mental handicap (no judgment to those who do have a handicap), or someone who is autistic (again, no judgment to  people living with autism). The best way I can describe it is that none of my interactions with people (even my family and friends) are “natural.” My thinking and my speech doesn’t flow normally. It truly feels like I have brain damage - and that’s how I described it to my husband before I was even diagnosed. I feel so hopeless and that it’s only going to get worse. I have completely lost who I used to be, and I would give anything to go back to her and to be somewhat normal.";r/BipolarReddit;186;158;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/16abp6y/severe_cognitive_decline/
2023-08-23 04:06:50;I was told I am gatekeeping being Bipolar;"For context: A friend of mine made a drastic change to their appearance (got a haircut) then told me they think they were having a manic episode because they got the haircut impulsively. 

I told this friend that I am sorry they regretted getting the haircut but if they actually think they had a manic episode then they should see a psychiatrist about it. They told me they didn't want to get an official diagnosis so they weren't going to see a psychiatrist. I let this friend know that a legitimate psychiatrist wont diagnose them on the first meeting because it takes time for them to evaluate you and Bipolar is a tricky diagnosis. Once I mentioned this, my friend got annoyed and said that they think they are bipolar and I should be understanding instead of gatekeeping a diagnosis.

I personally don't think I said anything wrong... I just don't think people should be walking around self diagnosing based off of an impulsive decision and then go to a diagnosed person hoping for validation and acceptance. The only person who can validate my friend is a licensed professional. 

So how am I gatekeeping?????";r/BipolarReddit;257;148;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/15ygyxk/i_was_told_i_am_gatekeeping_being_bipolar/
2023-04-20 15:21:36;So glad I found this sub and I'm not the only one going through this experience;"
I've been reading through the group and it seems my story sounds all too familiar now.
I tried to be a patient husband but...
My wife was diagnosed with bipolar just last year. I've been holding down the whole house with our 4 kids almost full time the past 6 months.  Doing almost all the cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids, while also providing the sole source of income while she stays home and reads and such.  I kept hoping it would get better, that she would get better.  She was absent from me and the kids and just always in the room, not going out to places with the kids and me which i was doing to ensure their hapiness at least.  And now this week, she had an affair with someone she called a friend she met just 3 weeks ago. I can't do it anymore.  I have put so much effort and stress into building our family and supporting her and she goes and does this to me.  I have to consider my own mental health and the kids mental health now...  I've already scheduled a consultation with 2 different lawyers.  I am hoping to keep the house and have more custody of the kids than her because she has done several things that has put the kids in danger and affected their education. She had also previously overdosed on ADHD meds and has stolen mine and the kids meds so i have to lock everything up. All the cards I have, have to remain locked so we don't go bankrupt as well.";r/BipolarSOs;74;34;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/12spuh9/so_glad_i_found_this_sub_and_im_not_the_only_one/

2023-03-11 06:12:36;My coworker told me today that last night he and the partners we work for were talking about mental health (because of a client) and they determined that I am the most mentally healthy in our group. They don’t know I’m bipolar.;"I’m a 29 year old bipolar 1 corporate attorney and absolutely do not disclose my diagnosis to anyone. It’s taken me a ton of years but  I manage it really well and I am now very stable, with the right medication, and a really healthy lifestyle. I’m truly doing well in life and I’ve been doing really well at my job since I joined the firm. 

It’s honestly so validating that people I work closely with professionally who have no idea about my past or my diagnosis would view me as not just mentally well, but healthier than the other high achieving lawyers we work with. 

10 years ago I did 20 treatments of shock therapy and I was hospitalized 3 times, twice related to suicide and once a really bad dissociative episode. I almost dropped out of high school and wound up at a therapeutic school for my last two years. Getting through college and law school was hell. 

But now I work out 6 days a week with clear goals (training for marathons and doing powerlifting), I am vegan and am very purposeful with how I eat and have lost a lot of the weight the risperdal made me put on during the pandemic, I take 13 pills per day, two mood stabilizers, an SSRI, and an antipsychotic and am totally med compliant, I do weekly therapy, massages twice a month, I prioritize my wife and my sons and family in general, I get 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and I made sure to set boundaries at my office right away so I could strike a balance.

2023-01-25 05:44:02;Info that might be useful to BPSOs new to their partners' diagnosis. What I did to fix my marriage.;"I discovered this sub in summer, when my partner was diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I was lost, confused, traumatized, abused, cheated on, broke and left alone with my kid. This sub was a tremendous assistance back then - I gained necessary knowledge re BP illness (which is very specific), support from bipolar dudes and their spouses (thank you all!) and it helped me to fix my almost destroyed relationships with my partner. 

I would like to pass my experience to anyone who is willing to help their diagnosed BPSOs and themselves. 

1. Meds come first. Without meds neither you nor your BP have chance to have adequate relationships with each other. Yes, symptomatic BPs tend to deny help at first. I was patient. I used LEAP approach to team up, support, listen and empathize. Slowly, step by step, day by day I showed love and understanding. They still love you its just you have to dig deeper in their soul to find this love and talk to it. I spoke to his soul. It worked. I took him to emergency where he was diagnosed and prescribed anti-psych meds. 

2. Take care of your own mental health. Its an absolute must. I got anti depressants, started active workouts, CBT therapy gave me useful tools, practiced cold exposure, watched and read a lot of motivational and educational material (this sub inclusive), shared my pain with people close to me, used their support. I said to myself - I am not giving up and I did not. 

3. After meds, give your BP some time to recover and use this time to make them feel safe around you. For them to feel safe you have to stabilize. If they see you stable - they do not freak out and rely on you. They need someone to rely on. Trust me they are very damaged by the situation. As well as you are. Give them emotional safety and stability. I know, I know, it is difficult as you are tired, empty inside and exhausted. However,  its a choice. I chose to stay with my partner of 12 years. My marriage has always been amazing apart from the period he was manic and unmedicated. So I gave science a chance. And I gave him a chance to prove he deserves me. 

4. Boundaries. Boundaries. Boundaries. Learn how to set up yours. You should not let them to yell at you, express their emotions in an aggressive or abusive way, use offensive language, be extremely irritated with anything you do. Cheating is a big problem when they are in the manic episode. Address this issue. Make it clear - they cheat you leave. If it already happened while they were manic and you can forgive them, let them know that they have exhausted their chances and you expect loyalty. Mean it. Be bold. Be courageous. Be strong. Defend yourself. Talk in a quiet voice but gather all your strength to make them believe you are not joking. 

5. Your partner sticks with their meds, have regular doctor's appointments, shares all the info with you, openly discusses their diagnosis with you. Remember, make them know you are not an enemy, you are a friend. Team up. They tend to doubt their diagnosis and ditch meds. Use humour to talk about it. Laugh. Make jokes. Be friendly. But at the same time let them know that their doubts are normal for bipolar people. Funny enough our ""anti hero"" when it comes to doubts and ditching meds is Kanye West lol (he is unmedicated bipolar and when he is in the episode its all over the news as he acts inadequate). I use this example to show why you have to stay medicated. Give them some educational material to read, read it with them, show relevant youtube videos, screenshots of discussions from this sub. By any means, they are staying committed to meds and therapy if you can afford it financially.

6. Adapt. Your life will never be the same.  And its not necessarily a negative thing. Do not reflect on the ""beautiful past days"". Past days are long gone and together you ll build a new future. Be busy. I am starting a new career for instance. Have your own path! With or without your partner you ll need it. Revive your hope. Change. Grow up physically and spiritually. Learn. Show your partner that you are confident, self sufficient and strong person. Be this person. Lead. Fight for your happiness. Stay motivated. Spread love and positivity for your own sakes. 

Medicated BP absolutely can live normal and happy lives along with their partners and kids! Give your bpso a chance, give yourself a chance! Do not loose hope. Wishing you all many happy days ahead!

It was all faked, he was in a narc cycle, not a manic one. It was the first time I guess he let loose around me and it was so similar to my moms bipolar episodes that’s all that made sense and i freaked out and asked if it could be that.

He manipulated the therapist for a diagnosis and all but since then I’ve been paying attention from all I’ve learned to help be a good partner for him.

I noticed he wasn’t following typical BP patterns and things weren’t adding up.


There’s a lot more subtle manipulative things he’s done I just connected the dots on over the last almost 3 years.

If it wasn’t for this group and the help I’ve received, I wouldn’t have known something was off.

I’m working on getting out but kids are involved and I’m also realizing how much underlying traumas they’re starting to display because of him.

&#x200B;

When reading through posts in this sub, PLEASE keep in mind that the vast majority of posts will be negative. It is just the nature of the sub, similar to r/relationships. People ask for advice when things are bad or there's a problem; they don't tend to vent about their relationship when things are going well. So, if you are in a new relationship and are looking for insight into what to expect or to better educate yourself, I would suggest reading through some of the ""Advice to Give"" flaired posts, or reading the book ""Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder"" as it is recommended here often. 

&#x200B;

If you are a user who is diagnosed with bipolar, please know that just because many of the posts and stories here are sad, scary, abusive, etc, that *does not* mean that you are doomed to the same fate. In fact, I highly recommend limiting your time on this sub to avoid being triggered and getting yourself into a depressed state. You are not a burden, and you are no less deserving of a loving relationship than anyone else. 

&#x200B;

Also, since I seem to need to repeat this from time to time, bipolar users are always welcome in this sub. They often give valuable insight into what our SO's are dealing with, which is extremely helpful for us non-bipolar spouses. However, invalidation is not allowed.

&#x200B;

If you see a post or comment that goes against our sub rules, please report it so it can be dealt with by the mod team, otherwise it likely won't get seen.

I am lucky enough to have a wife who makes me sleep and stayed through the worst of my depression. Even with all of that, studying for that goddamn exam almost broke me. I had my worst hypo episode yet and was certain I was going to jump off my apartment building if I failed.

2021-07-14 09:17:10;I've been in full remission for 9 years. AMA;"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and suffered with poorly controlled symptoms for a number of years. After a second hospitalization I learned my illness had progressed to bipolar 1. I entered the hospital thinking the government and my psychiatrist were conspiring to kill me. I was homicidal, suicidal, strung out on drugs, and I had run away to live in the subway to escape the mind beams I thought my doc and the air force were trying to use to control me from airplanes and satellites.  After a long period of recovery, these are the things that were the most important for my long period of remission, in descending order:

1. Lithium. Everyone with bipolar should have the fundamental right to be put on lithium first before antipsychotics. (For bipolar 2, anticonvulsants such as Lamictal are probably ok, unless they aren't working). I feel very strongly about lithium. I'm also very sceptical about stimulant medications. There's a reason so many people with bipolar go off all their meds....except their stimulant meds. They are directly correlated with both mania and drug seeking behavior. 

2. Therapy. DBT therapy and IPSRT therapy offer essential insights and skills. CBT therapy seems to be useful but not until emotional stability is present. 

3. Family. My family all learned the [LEAP approach.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://easacommunity.org/files/Engagement%2520Tips_LEAP%2520Model.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiGlOW2ruHxAhXHMd8KHfjxAbkQFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3201RLsG3ySuS_9g5aN3IK) 
Once they knew how to help me, things became much easier for everyone. This [TED tak](https://youtu.be/NXxytf6kfPM) gives a brief overview but studying and practicing LEAP is the only way.

4. Faith. Yes I do kind of mean faith in God but also faith that if I just kept taking my meds and doing the bare minimum of what I could do, life would improve one day. It did. This faith in the goodness of the future should always be reinforced when a person with controlled bipolar expresses it. (It shouldn't be forced upon a person though). 

5. Abstaining from alcohol, weed, drugs, nicotine and coffee. Quitting these things was hell (especially nicotine and coffee) but now I'd never go back. Hospitalization gave me a huge head start when I was locked away from these things for 14 days and I realized I could get away from them.

6. Doctor told me mania and depression both cause brain damage, and that medication would stop this cycle. Also, doctor told me that there is no such thing as ""controlling bipolar without medications"", the disease will simply continue to worsen and progress naturally without medication.

7. I wake up at the same time every morning. Surprisingly, when I go to bed doesn't matter nearly as much. I set an alarm and I get out of bed no matter what. Bipolar is a disorder of circadian rhythms, and waking up on a schedule resets the body's clock.

8. Time off from work....until it was time to go back to work. 

That's how I see my recovery. I was a disaster for many years. I am happy to answer any questions.

IMPORTANT EDIT: if you are interested in helping your bipolar SO, the best way to help is to learn the LEAP method in #3 above. The WORST way to ""help"" would be to show them a post like this as ""proof"" they can do it too (if they only do a, b, and c). Please don't do that.

2021-07-04 04:09:32;Britney Spears' conservatorship abuse is a testament to the devastating oppression and lack of basic rights mentally ill people as a whole have to live with.;"Like everyone else on the planet, I've been following Britney Spears' struggle with the incredibly oppressive conservatorship she's been under and feeling both shocked and disgusted at how this can be legal.

But at the same time, this case is a testament to just how little rights many mentally ill people have in the U.S. How people with mental illnesses, particularly complex mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, often have to live with this reminder in the back of our heads that tells us to make sure to never make certain kinds of mistakes, or else the consequences can be dire, and sometimes lifelong.

I think firstly of involuntary psychiatric holds at hospitals, which many may argue are necessary (and which I personally think can sometimes be necessary, while at other times can be excessive and unwarranted, depending on the situation), but regardless of their necessity, are almost always degrading and dehumanizing. Rather than aiming to help the person admitted to them, they often include medical abuse, denigration from the hospital staff, being treated as less than human, and feeling as though you're being punished for seeking out help. I don't know a single person who hasn't been traumatized by their stay in a psychiatric hospital, even if only for a few days.

I also think of reproductive rights, such as what Britney mentioned in her statement regarding a forced IUD, and the unique ways in which they affect mentally ill women. I think it's impossible to discuss the oppression of the mentally ill without discussing the oppression specific to mentally ill women, and how the medical stereotype of ""female hysteria"" has long affected how medical decisions towards mentally ill women are made. Women with mental illnesses have long been denied access to proper reproductive rights, including both being forced to be on birth control, like Britney's case, as well as the adverse of being denied access to permanent sterilization options (getting their tubes tied) due to the belief that they may not be in their ""sound minds"" to make that decision. Mentally ill women who are mothers also often express a fear of having their children taken away from them due to belief that they cannot be ""fit mothers"" (despite much proof of the opposite being true). And in cases like Britney's, it's evident how those fears do come to life. Like many have also mentioned, if this is what's happening out in the open, imagine how badly this is going on behind closed doors, the thousands of mentally ill women who don't have the public spotlight as Britney but are having their basic reproductive rights and/or parental rights stripped from them nonetheless.

Not to mention other ways in which mentally ill people are barred from having the same treatment as everyone else. Life insurance companies are reticent to provide services to people with bipolar disorder, and it often requires a lot of effort for us to get these services. Also, as a student hoping to go to medical school and become a doctor, I will, legally, have to tick the box on every medical school form that says that I may not be able to perform my duties fully because I've been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, I'm not allowed to dispute this or argue against the truthfulness of that statement for myself. All of these barriers are 100% legal. And none of this is even getting into the legal system and how mental illnesses are often criminalized, with the judicial system aiming to incarcerate the mentally ill who make mistakes rather than provide them with the care that they need, treating mental illnesses as a criminal issue rather than a public health one.

All of this is basically to say that it's exhausting. It's exhausting existing in a world that doesn't respect your humanity, despite how capable or functional you may be, despite the fact that you can be empathetic and kind and a good friend to others, how you can have hobbies and a life in which you regularly make good and responsible decisions and can take care of yourself, any slip-up from normalcy you make will be seen as a good reason to stigmatize you and potentially take your rights away from you, and even if you somehow made yourself into a perfect person who did everything right and never made a single mistake again, never had a single manic episode ever again, nor a depressive one for that matter, the label you've been diagnosed with will still be used to stigmatize you and make you feel like a second class resident in your space.

I hope someday this won't be true.";r/BipolarReddit;263;42;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/od5dla/britney_spears_conservatorship_abuse_is_a/
2021-06-16 01:40:19;What it feels like: Hypomania.;"Earlier this month I wrote a post about what depression feels like, and it seemed to really help both bipolar and SO’s

Today I’ll try to do the same for the other side of bp: the “up” side - which is just as dangerous, but less noticeable. 

A few notes before I start:

1. No part of this post is here to justify any behavior good or bad. I’m not here to judge but I’m also not here to provide excuses for shitty people.

2. Hypomania & Mania are two different things. I’m not BP1 so never experienced mania.

What I’m about to share only applies to Hypomania which is the high phase experienced in bp3 & bp2, and sometimes as a gateway to full blown mania in BP1.

If you don’t know the difference it’s important to educate yourself (and also use the right term in conversation) - Wikipedia is great for this. 

3. I’m not a professional. I’m not here to explain things scientifically - only to share what I go through and how it feels to me. 

===================

Ok, Ready? 

So... how does it feel to be Hypomanic?

Well, 

For starters, we usually don’t notice it. You just feel sort of... good.

Undiagnosed or freshly diagnosed BP’s who are less aware of their triggers might assume it has to do with the whether, something good that happened, a nice song, etc.

Why is it dangerous?

Well there are two main factors here:

1. Our happiness is often a little detached from reality (just like our depression usually is). We’re happy due to chemical imbalance, and we think things are better than they really are.
2. This is when we plant the seeds that make our depressive phases so crippling. I’ll explain. 

==== How does that feel in real life? ====

Well, when we’re hypomanic we’re very energetic, often able to focus (not always), and often very creative. 

And very optimistic. 

Which sucks. 

I can’t describe how much it sucks. 

Why does optimism suck? 

Because even when we come to terms with the dangers of hypo optimism - it still feels so good..... especially after a long depressive episode where all you want is to feel hope again.

BTW, Hypomania is one of the things that makes bipolar so hard to diagnose. Because you don’t usually feel like there’s a problem.

You feel great, you easily handle crises, you’re creative, you’re productive... you’re even happier with how you look, and have more confidence.

+=== “So... why is this bad, again?”

Because the optimism makes you think it will last forever. 

And it often makes you even believe that you’re “cured”, which is why BP’s sometimes stop taking their meds (very bad decision) during hypo phases.

But also when we’re hypomanic we tend to make a lot of commitments:

Tight deadlines we know we can make since we’re so productive... New projects we thing we can juggle with unfinished one’s because we feel like there are 48 hours in a day (and who needs sleep anyway??)....

Social commitments we’re super excited about, social commitments we’re not excited about but think we can handle and feel guilty for not doing when we were depressed, family stuff etc.... 

And then?

When depression hits again, which is 100% unpredictable, we’re in deep shit.

Not only we have all these commitments and zero energy - we now don’t have the mind clarity needed to problem-solve and get out of them, nor do we have the social skills to apologize / postpone, or the optimism needed to understand that the world won’t end if we miss a meeting or a deadline.

But wait... there’s more!

Hypomania makes us very optimistic about money. That promotion? It’s in the bag! That loan? I’m sure it’ll be approved. My boss loves me I’m sure he’ll give me a raise. Lottery? “I read about m a strategy that works!”... “just found out about this stock that all the experts think is gonna blow up!”

This is when we make bad money decisions, and we can be VERY persuasive with our reasoning since we truly 100% believe it will be ok, and it makes perfect logical sense to us - even to spend money we don’t have yet.

And this is why I don’t have a credit card. 

I make good money, and that just makes it worse because I have “proof” that money will come.

So I think we covered the basics / most important things, let’s talk about some other symptoms:

==== Irritability. ====

Being hypomanic is like being on turbo mode. You have 1,000 ideas per minute, 250 tabs open on your laptop, 5 projects you’re juggling (successfully!) simultaneously.....

...and you’re still ahead if everybody else. 

Feeding the baby while on a zoom call with corporate all while designing the new logo for the company you just thought of creating. Answering emails while in soccer practice in between goals.

It makes you feel like everybody else is in slow motion. 

People walk too slow. Drive too slow. Talk too slow (“get to the point already you!!!!!!”).

You set crazy deadlines and beat them and you expect everybody to work at the same pace as you. You send a text at 3am and expect an answer right away. 

It’s hard to explain how annoying it is. 

Remember that scene from the trailer of Zootopia with the sloth at the DMV? Imagine living it 24/7 with no escape.

The thing is, we’re not always aware that it’s hypomania. 

We don’t feel “productive” necessarily, we often just feel “not depressed “... so we think this is how normal people are, and we expect everybody to be as sharp, creative, energetic and fast as we are.

==== Hyper-sexuality ====

This is a weird one. When I realized it’s a bp symptom it explained so much!

So here’s how I experience it: it’s not about an increased sex drive. 

It’s more like a drainage of sexual satisfaction. 

Imagine being hungry -> eating -> and still being hungry. Not even a delay. 3 meals a day? Still hungry. Just had a meal? Steal hungry.

As a guy, it’s hard. No pun intended. There’s only so much my body can take, but my mind wants more. 

Let me rephrase that: my mind demands more and will not be quite if I don’t do something about it, even if the relevant body parts are sore. 

You know how sometimes you’re so hungry you can’t even think? It’s an annoying feeling.

Now, first problem this causes in a relationship, is obviously the heightened sex drive which might not be met with an equal sex drive from the other partner. 

Especially since it’s not consistent and might come after a long or short period of close to zero drive due to depression. Mixed signals are always bad in a relationship.

2nd problem, of course, is consequences. 

Personally I’ve been always faithful to my SO, since we were high school sweethearts. I’m a monogamous guy, she was my 2nd GF ever, and I’ve never been the one night stand / hook up kinda guy.

But I do often read about BP’s who lost control during hypomania and cheated. (Not an excuse, imho).

I also see a lot of couples getting into OnlyFans etc during a hypomanic phase of one of them, later regretting it, etc.

Personally, I’m mostly interested in my wife, but I “self medicate” to take the stress off her (although it’s just not the same, I think this is more than just being horny, I think we need to feel adored and desired due to another hypomania symptom - grandiosity).

Something else that happens in hypomania for me is i get crushes all the time. I see a cute girl on the street and I’m ready to merry her on the spot. It’s not even a sex thing. It’s weird. 

Combine that shit with irritability (SO can be annoying as hell just for talking too slow or taking time to decide what to have for dinner) and unrealistic optimism (I’m a god, I can get away with anything) - and it’s a real risk. 

I don’t believe I will ever cheat on my wife, especially since I’m now very aware of the symptoms, but I can see how it can lead there either in a weaker relationship or with less awareness. 

Again, not an excuse. 

==== grandiosity ====

We feel larger than life. We were meant to do great things. We’re special, unique, talented. 

Combine those feelings with the first part, (high productivity & creativity) - and we have good reason to believe this. 

In fact, a lot of great things both in business and arts were created thanks to hypomanic bipolars (from Stephen Fry to Kanye West, and I think Michelangelo?). 

Now, while it’s far far from narcissism, it is our most narcissistic trait.

We tend to believe we deserve 100% of the spot light, and we can also be quite condescending even if trying not to be. 

(See, when you’re a demigod, you want to be humble. But when a demigod is humble it comes from a very demigoddy place, ya know?)

(Cue ‘what can I say except you’re welcome’... Maui is sooo bipolar lol ;))

==== mixed episodes ====

mixed episodes are periods where we’re not depressed or hypomanic, but rather we move from one end to another quite fast (sometimes called rapid cycling).

Cycles can be days, or even hours. I had a few months where I woke up depressed every morning and ended every day hypomanic as hell. And I was lucky b/c at least I knew I’d feel better later on. 

Most of the time we aren’t as lucky and the cycles are not consistent so we experience symptoms of both depression and hypomania at the same time.

It’s weird. Like, I feel like a complete failure fraud, with zero confidence and zero self worth - but at the same time better than anybody on earth..... and PISSED because nobody’s going fast enough or can keep up with my sorry-ass-excuse-for-a-human-being (that is also the god of productiveness and god of the fine arts). 

==== how to treat a hypomanic SO? ====

So, the way I see and feel - hypomania is our time to shine. We focused on the bad parts, but It’s also the only good thing about this horrible fucking illness, and 99% of our chances to enjoy things in general, are during hypomania.

Don’t kill our vibe, if possible. 

That said: 

1. keep an eye on our triggers & symptoms. Without being able to point out to us that we’re hypomanic - none of the next steps are going to work.
2. Keep an eye on our spending / money. See what I meant in #1? You won’t convince us that buying a baby white tiger is a bad decision. But you might be able to point out we’re hypomanic and that we should give it a month and see if we REALLY still want that baby tiger ;/)
3. Keep an eye on our meds. If you’re familiar with my posts you know I think getting off meds is a red line. I’m not saying leave your SO immediately if they stop taking their meds, but take it extremely seriously, and yes, if you can’t help fix the situation it might be a good reason to rethink things. 

If you can be patient and forgiving while we’re impatient with you, we would appreciate it, but if you can’t - just remind us (c a r e f u l l y) we’re not really annoyed, it’s the hypo. 

(Pls don’t use hypo as an excuse though we might be really bothered by something, help us figure out, don’t just automatically assume it’s the illness).

If you can address our craving for attention, including sexual attention(from flirting to actual sex), we’d extremely appreciate it. 

Of course if you can’t, just try to be easy on us when “rejecting” us. Our ego is extremely sensitive at those points. Let us know we are desired even if we’re a bit too much. 

If you can get excited about our projects and our creations, and maybe even listen to us blabbering about them, we will feel important and loved. 

Help us stay grounded without chopping off our wings. Again the key here is helping us be aware.

Personally when I feel like the next Michelangelo (both the artist and the ninja turtle!) I like to do things like laundry etc to keep me grounded. But if you’ll tell me I’m not michaelangelo or that maybe I need to be “more realistic” or “more grounded” I’ll hate you ;) 

So like I said, it’s better to discuss symptoms and triggers in advance, it’s easier if you just tell me “give your idea some time, and maybe help with the laundry while you think it over”.

==== Finally, ====

If your spouse uses any of these symptoms as an excuse for ANYTHING, It’s totally uncool. 

I’ve described what goes on in our brain. It’s different for different people, easier or harder to manage for different people, etc - but it should never be an excuse for shitty behavior. 

If your BPSO cannot manage their hypomania or take responsibility for their  actions during hypomania - it’s a problem. 

Its totally normal to be in denial. It’s extremely hard to be aware enough of triggers, symptoms, or the connection between a certain action and one of the symptoms - 

But if your SO refuses to try, refuses to make an effort in analyzing and improving their behavior - than it’s a very big problem, one that might be unsolvable by you.

2021-06-10 17:58:16;I'm going to sale all my firearms.;"Being from a rural town in Texas guns have been apart of my life as far back as I can remember. Pretty much every major birthday or Christmas I have been given a firearm as a gift. I even have my license to carry. This allows me to pretty much walk in a gun store and buy a gun no questions asked. And that's to much power for me. And it's hard for me to say this being pro 2nd amendment. There need to be more control on who can purchase a gun.

I'm diagnosed Bipolar and Schizophrenic and because I have never been forcibly admitted to a mental institution the state of Texas says I can own a gun/carry and even purchase one with out paper work.

I used to feel safe around firearms now they make me worry for my safety and my family's safety. My medication seems to have stuff under control for the time being but I don't feel as if I can trust that. All it would really take is one bad day and I can ruin my life or someone else's. I have talked to my wife and we have come to the conclusion its best for the family. My parents don't understand what I'm going through and for sure won't understand me getting rid of my guns but it has to be done.";r/BipolarReddit;230;47;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/nwjsqk/im_going_to_sale_all_my_firearms/
2021-05-20 00:36:56;I am so proud of my BPSO for finishing grad school and landing a fantastic job;"My girlfriend (BP2) has finished writing her master's thesis and will be defending in the next couple of weeks. Next month, she'll be starting a job as a scientist at a large pharma company with fantastic pay and benefits that I am very envious of haha. I am just so proud of her and in awe of how hard she works despite her illness. 

She actively manages her illness, attends all her therapies, actively works with her pdoc, and regularly takes her meds. As I'm sure you've all experienced, she complains about this--of course she hates having to do all this and will question it sometimes, but she continues at it. And while the results are not always obvious to her, they are to me. There have been downs and low-lows, especially when she was first diagnosed. Despite the lows, she's always had an unwavering devotion to her work and I've always been astounded by that. 

She communicates with me, and recently we've been working even more on both actively communicating with each other more. She has such a funny and silly personality and is just a fantastic person! 

I love her so much and I'm so proud. We both of course hate what this illness has taken from her. She has been successful thus far, but she'll always question what more she could do if her illness wasn't in the way. But despite that, she perseveres, works hard, and does all the right things that are within her control. She never gives herself enough credit for just how damn hard she works but I do my best to try to remind her and encourage her. 

We are doing our best to build a comfortable and happy life together. I know there are always going to be times in our relationship where there is disproportionation. While the majority of the time things are good, there are times where help is needed, and I'll be there. But honestly, while I'm ""dating someone with BP"", day to day I just see her as my wholesome, silly, smart girlfriend. 

So many posts here are so sad, but the happy, positive, realistic posts are what gives me hope. Hope for our future together and hope for her health. I hope someone reading this now or in the future can take some comfort that there are happy, normal stories of dating with BP.";r/BipolarSOs;83;4;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/ngajhh/i_am_so_proud_of_my_bpso_for_finishing_grad/

2021-05-06 11:42:04;I’m Bipolar, had cancer beat it, and now have cancer again. Bipolar is just as or in my experience even harder to deal with than cancer. Everyone here deserves the same love and support as people with cancer and other physical illness and it aches my heart we mostly suffer in silence.;"I am thankfully lucky enough to be stable with only Lithium and it works great for me. But since I was 18 and finally diagnosed my life has been a series of drastic ups and downs. A few months ago I went off of lithium to try and conceive and WAS NOT stable, major depressive episode and it is so fucking hard (I’m new to Reddit can we curse on here? 🤷🏼‍♀️) 

Unfortunately while instead of conceiving I found out I have cancer as well and actually started treatment (chemo and radiation) today. I also had cancer when I was 16. Seeing the support that is given for cancer vs the pretty much lack of support for bipolar disorder and all mental illness is night and day and it aches my heart. And having both happen so closely to one another only put to the forefront the thoughts I had on this subject since I was younger (I’m 31 now)

To everyone here suffering from bipolar disorder you deserve all the care packages and flowers in the world. Every single thing that is offered to people suffering cancer or other physical diseases should be offered to people with bipolar and other illnesses as well. We should not have to struggle in some stigmatized silence just cause our disease can’t be pinpointed on an MRI or CT scan. 

Cancer sucks, but fighting bipolar is the hardest thing I’ve had to struggle with in my life. I dream of a world where everyone can say I’m bipolar and get the same amount of love given to them as to anyone who has to say I have cancer. At the end of the day it’s just not fucking fair and I’m sick of it. 

If anyone needs, I’m here to talk. I’m currently back on lithium and stable but wish I had better words to convey to anyone who reads this how strong and resilient you have to be to live with bipolar disorder. How hard it is to be bipolar and to not have society understand how truly strong we are for living it day to day.

I am so, so tired of people who seem to want to be Bipolar. I get that a diagnosis can be a relief because it is an explanation for so many struggles, but so often it sounds like people are excited to be diagnosed or hopeful that they will be.  

I am tired of people who seem to be proud of taking a ton of medications.  They want to show off all of their pills or talk about their high doses in a boastful way.

I am tired of people talking about Bipolar as a gift.  They discuss the excitement and creativity and nighttime cleaning sprees...

Bipolar is not a gift.  It is a disorder.  There is a reason it is called a disorder.  Sure, we are more likely to be creative, but we are also far more likely to kill ourselves.  We are impulsive and far more likely to be drug addicts and alcoholics.  Last statistic I read said that only 33% of us can work, and not all of the 33% can manage working full time.

My brain is quite literally destroying itself.  I am trying to figure out a medication protocol where I am weighing organ failure against diabetes against Parkinson's like movement disorders.  I am trying treatment after treatment, busting my ass in therapy, all while trying to raise my child in a loving, wholesome, stable atmosphere.  

I drool at night.  My tongue rubs against my teeth until it bleeds.  I am close to being obese even though only a few months ago I was in a completely healthy weight range.  I have cystic acne brought on by medications.  I struggle with word retrieval... The simplest words I will lose, even though I have a Master's degree.

Bipolar is not a gift.  It is not a form of neurodiversity.  It isn't cool or fun or exotic.  It is torture.  It is painful.  I dare say it is manipulative, tricking someone into thinking they are well only to bring them to their knees.

2021-03-31 11:53:39;World Bipolar Day. What an unfortunate day of commemoration.;"I'm about to lay down some truth. Today is #worldbipolarday. March 30. I wasn't aware of this date and frankly it caught me entirely by surprise. Here's why.

20% of untreated bipolar patients end their lives due to suicide. *20%.*

Despite comprising 1-2% of the general population, suicide attempts among bipolar people are 20-30 times more prevalent.

On average, it takes a person with bipolar disorder 10 *years* to get diagnosed.

On a personal level, it took me ten years from when my symptoms first started showing to get diagnosed.

On paper I have bipolar NOS (not otherwise specified), in reality I have something closer to bipolar type 1--where you experience ""big M"" mania, instead of ""little M"" hypomanias.

I have experienced psychosis. I have experienced delusions. I have experienced euphoric flights of ideas and massive bursts of uncontrollable energy. I've burned other people out with my zeal and lust for life.

My mood has dropped off a cliff, in the middle of the highest highs. Call me Icarus. I flew too close to the sun and my wings were plucked. Frankly, it's too hard and too painful for me to meaningfully reflect on my lows, except to say that when they hit, the light goes out. Energy plummets, thoughts are slow, and I'm stuck in a morass of existence that never wants to end.

😥

I've never tried to kill myself. I'm fortunate in that regard. It is impossible for me to consider this disease, however, without considering the enormous human cost it's exacted. It's an unforgiving and unforgivable tax. And it's something that haunts me.

I am not just a list of symptoms on an image on your Facebook wall. I am not a thirty second clip on a mental health youtube video. I am not an inspirational story. I am not a statistic.

I am a person who carries the seeds of a disease that can overwhelm and strangle me if allowed to go unchecked. I am a person who second guesses themselves, their feelings, their thoughts, their very way of being in the fear of being lost to another mania and inevitable depression. I am a person wholly dependent on insurance for the thousands of dollars of medication I require on a monthly basis to keep me sane.

And at the same time, I know the feeling of being touched by deity, of chasing fire, the inexplicable rush and addiction of my own neurochemistry, the craving and chasing and needing and crashing, this manic depressive rollercoaster that I can't get off... I hate this disease and I love this disease. There are only two ways about it. Those are them.

I was having a great day before I learned it was world Bipolar day. I really was. I hope this post makes you think a little harder about the people behind this disease and the things we go through, makes you a little more empathetic, a little more appreciative of what we endure on a monthly, weekly, daily, sometimes hour by hour basis. This is a disease I live in fear and awe of every day, and one I am thankful to have under control, through sleep, medication, therapy, and social support. I can't do it alone, and I don't have to.

Why did I enable so much? Sure I was scared shitless - living on eggshells is the phrase I’ve used and it is reassuring to see it used by others throughout the sub.

2021-01-06 06:45:01;Welcome to BipolarReddit! A Message from the Community;"Welcome! This is a community focused on supporting people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. If you are bipolar, we’re glad you’re here. We are a judgement-free community that wants to see all people diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve enduring health and balance. 

As you explore the discussions, here is a primer on how this community works.

* Most people who post and comment on r/BipolarReddit have already received a medical diagnosis, including bipolar type 1, type 2, schizoaffective or cyclothymia. If you have not yet sought a diagnosis, we encourage you to meet with a doctor, discuss your concerns and solicit their diagnosis. However, you are welcome to read and ask general questions in your pursuit of health.  
* A medical diagnosis can only be given by a medical professional. If you are concerned enough about your mental health to ask if you are bipolar, that is sufficient reason for you to seek a medical opinion. None of us participate here in a medical capacity, and no one here can or will tell you if you are bipolar. Those kinds of questions are not for this subreddit.
* We like to be precise. Terms like mania, hypomania and major depression have specific definitions, and we ask you to familiarize yourself with the medical terminology. We have created a wiki for (and authored by) people with bipolar disorder, based on the DSM-V. Please [review the definitions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index/definitions). **Important Note:** The terms mania and hypomania are often conflated, inaccurately. Please be exact in your use of these terms when posting and commenting because it helps the community understand the severity of what you are experiencing, which helps us give you the best support. Mania is a medical emergency that typically requires hospitalization. We understand that it can be hard to know exactly what is going on in the moment. Just do your best so we can better understand you. 
* We invite you to [explore the rest of our subreddit’s wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index), which has valuable information and resources this community has compiled. There are some common questions for people with bipolar disorder. Before posting a question, please look through the wiki to see if your question has already been answered.

The medicine has helped even my mood out, but I mostly had long depressive bouts with hypomania usually occurring at the tail end and never causing any damage other than making me seem lazy for not following through with the big plans I would make to change my life.  Even with the diagnosis, a part of me keeps telling that I don’t actually have it and that I should stop taking my medicine because I don’t have full manic episodes and I haven’t felt depressed for longer than a week for about 1.5-2 years. 

Do you guys ever feel like that? Sorry for rambling. The only person I know with bipolar disorder that I talk to is my dad and he insists that you can grow out of it.

2020-09-30 23:06:25;Fourteen years ago, I left high school due to uncontrolled bipolar disorder. This week I successfully defended my Ph.D.;"I'm still in shock.

It's been a long road. I started having symptoms around age 12-13 that steadily got worse through my teens and early twenties. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD and given stimulants (that was a disaster). I left high school at 16 because I was failing everything (in CA they let you test out at 16 and get something like a high school diploma). I enrolled in community college for about four years with varying degrees of success each semester. After that I stumbled into a 4 year state school after a manic episode caused me to move halfway across the country on a whim. I scraped by my two remaining years in undergrad and managed to graduate (still undiagnosed and unmedicated). Decided to get my masters since I couldn't hold down a job (VERY BAD REASON TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL). I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar I during my first year of my masters degree after a severe manic episode. Went on abilify which made me want to crawl out of my skin. Went on seroquel, Went on lithium. Went on risperidone. Risperidone did the trick. Decided to enroll in my Ph.D. program during a hypomanic episode (I tend to make major life decisions while manic). Still uncontrolled at this point, but medicated at least. Did terribly in my classes, but managed to pass them.  Had a hospitalization right before my qualifying exams. Completely failed my qualifying exams. I petitioned to retake them and actually sought out accommodations to help with the anxiety (extra time and a quiet testing environment, and I could bring my dog who I decided, while manic, to train as a psychiatric service dog to help with panic attacks).  Eked by on my qualifying exams while having a horrible mixed episode. Many horrifically embarrassing emails were sent to various people in the department. Somehow they didn't kick me out.

At this point (4 years post diagnosis), the risperiodone was really starting to work. I stabilized and decided to move to part time on my Ph.D. and teach full time. I went a year without an episode, then two. The risperidone had awful side effects, but I was terrified to change drugs. I developed metabolic problems and that scared me more. I switched to Vraylar, which is a rough transition. The Vraylar kept me stable and helped more with depression. I went three years without an episode. The pandemic hit and my carefully honed routines were thrown out the window. I had my first episode in years this summer, but it was surprisingly minor and I was mostly able to keep working on my dissertation. I had to postpone my defense by two months, but that was it.";r/BipolarReddit;815;36;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/j2nuxe/fourteen_years_ago_i_left_high_school_due_to/
2020-09-28 22:53:45;Today, I submitted my PhD dissertation.;"I remember the first time a doctor told me I might be bipolar. Last summer (2019), I had a major depressive episode lasting over a month. It came right after a few weeks of increased productivity and frantic energy. My GP put me on an SSRI, and I ended up in the ER days later because it had switched me into a hypomanic state. It was 4:00 in the morning, I had barely slept for days. I wasn't eating. I felt like I could take on the world and run a marathon in the middle of the night. It was the best I had ever felt. That night, they took away my SSRI and put me on seroquel to try and end the hypomanic episode and make me sleep. I burst into tears when they took it away and I flew into a panic when they said I might actually be bipolar.

What followed was months of denial. I got my GP to put me back on the SSRI because I told her the ER incident was actually just a panic attack. She said mania has to last months for it to be bipolar so she willingly prescribed it again. For the next few months, I flew into mixed states until I ended up harming myself. That's when I was set up with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed as bipolar.

I remember crying a lot when I was first diagnosed. I thought it was the end of my career. I thought I'd never get my doctorates and I'd end up slowly going crazy.

But, I did it. Today, I submitted my PhD dissertation with my supervisor's enthusiastic approval. Now, I just have to wait for the oral defence after the examiners have time to read through it.

To those newly diagnosed, don't freak out. A bipolar diagnosis isn't the end of your goals and dreams. It isn't a death sentence. It's an opportunity for you to stick to treatment, make lifestyle changes, and take it one day at a time.

2020-08-05 15:02:59;Bipolar Insiders Look;"Hey all.  I’m a bipolar gay guy that scrolls through here every now and then just to get a feel for what it’s like dating someone with my diagnosis.

First off.  What some of y’all have been through truly sucks.  No one deserves to go through any form of trauma when looking for love.

Second...  I know it doesn’t seem like a disability all the time because most of us are able-bodied and when we’re asymptotic things tend to go relatively smoothly... but this is a truly all consuming disability.

With each episode our brains are dulled just a bit more... literally, our neurophysiology is warped and worsens each time.  Our bodies age from a battery of stress hormones and lack of care from however we are coping.  It is an exhausting disease well before you include medication.

This is a confusing disease and we are trying to figure it out how to cope while also having to question where our personality begins and our symptoms end... “is there a clear line or is there overlap?  Am I different because I’m older, or am I hypomanic?”

Mood disorders are difficult and require some REALLY smart insightful navigators to help live.  Read books, watch talks, go get your own therapist so you and your BPSO have common language around these topics.

LOVE.  Self-hate is what puts most bipolar people in the hospital.  I’ve met a bunch of really cool, very sad people in the psych ward and the common thread was an intense self-hate.  If you love someone with bipolar, foster intimacy, learn how to love on each other even when it’s difficult.  Love on them without shame, expect and trust that their love to you will be just as precious.  This is BPSO not BP-we-fucked-when-he-was-hypo-and-now-he-isn’t-texting (BPWFWHWHANHIT)";r/BipolarSOs;103;39;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/i40mbm/bipolar_insiders_look/
2020-08-04 10:59:12;I graduated from college 2 days ago;"3 years into my college experience I had a complete mental breakdown, left school, was hospitalized and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was terrified. I went back to school the following semester and it was way too soon and I had a very bad depressive episode. I had to drop half of my classes but made it through. I had multiple episodes (both manic and depressive) following my return but I did the work on myself (therapy, medication, honesty with my providers and my parents) and took it one day at a time to get my schoolwork done. It wasn’t easy but after 6 years I can finally say that I did it. 

I am bipolar and I am a college graduate.

Hopefully this inspires someone to keep moving toward their goals. I didn’t want to trigger anyone with this post but I saw the depths of hell surrounding and following my diagnosis. But I pushed through and never quit. Anything you want to do, you can do it, even with this diagnosis. It’s not easy, but I promise it’s possible.

2020-07-23 23:25:30;Being a BPSO is a commitment like no other;"Just some background first: My BF and I have been together for 8 1/2 years. He was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 almost 2 years ago. He went into a full blown manic episode prior to being diagnosed and was hospitalized for almost a week (this was actually his second time being hospitalized but we weren’t together the first time and he was not diagnosed then). There was also a gap of about 10 years between episodes. In hindsight, there were red flags prior to everything but I didn’t know any better. I am the one who took him to the hospital and had him checked in. It took a lot of convincing, but even in his manic state, he trusted me. A small part of me felt as though I was betraying him. I am not exaggerating when I say that leaving him there was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I know it is what he needed to get back on his feet, but that didn’t make it any easier. 

There were times after his diagnosis where I didn’t know if we would survive this as a couple. I just wanted things to go back to normal and so did he. I soon realized, things would never go back to normal. We will never get back to our life the way it was before and that’s ok! We have to find a new normal. I am willing to do that with him for as long as he will have me. I love him more than I can ever express and have made the decision to stick with him through this, no matter what. 

I guess what I’m getting at is that choosing to be with someone who is bipolar is a huge and serious commitment! It is not easy for anyone involved. If you have chosen to NOT stay with your BPSO, you’re not a bad person. Sometime, it just doesn’t work out and the relationship is too toxic. Every case of Bipolar is different. You are not weak if you have chosen that this isn’t the life for you. But if you do choose it, commit! Be there for your SO. Because no matter how much you think YOU are going through, they are dealing with just as much if not more.";r/BipolarSOs;78;14;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/hwhkru/being_a_bpso_is_a_commitment_like_no_other/

2020-04-01 05:11:20;My Bipolar SOs story is over;"My husband of 30+ years passed away earlier this month.  While the formal diagnosis was renal failure due to overuse of pain medication (Alleve) related to his hip pain, my kids and I think that he ultimately gave up.  I keep a journal, and an entry prior to the latest issue (hip) really threw me, as I guess I'd blocked it out.  Basically, my pain and frustration at yet another suicide threat, that he just couldn't stand to live this way any longer, as his BP swings seemed to get more extreme with every passing year, no matter how many meds he took, or how often he changed them up, and he hated feeling this way and what it did to those he loved.

The week before he passed, we all knew something was wrong, but never having known anyone in renal failure before, I didn't recognize the signs.  I told him repeatedly, he needed to go the the doctor as his ability to breath worsened (I thought he perhaps had pneumonia, this was prior to COVID being common).  His boss sent him home and told him don't come back till you go to the doctor.  He lied to us all and said he went.  The next day, when I found out he lied, I took him to the ER and that was ultimately the end.  

I've gone back and forth between being angry at myself for not physically dragging him to the doc earlier, for not paying more attention and researching his symptoms more thoroughly, for being frustrated with him for yet again refusing to pay attention to his physical health (3rd major health crisis/near death experience for him).  That I didn't do more to force him to take care of himself.  But then I remember that this is what he wanted.  He told me many times before, he'd kill himself in a minute if it wouldn't jeopardize his life insurance.  So maybe this was his way to get what he wanted, and take care of me and the kids.  I don't know what to believe.  I want the man I married back, before this bastard of a disease stole him away.  I know that wasn't possible.

2020-02-29 00:57:18;Bipolar is a progressive disorder. Please *STAY* on the stabilizer Meds.;"Just want to add for people that don’t know this yet:

Reference/ Citation from NHS: [NHS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857867/#idm140033947051248title) 

If you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the dx is *a certainty*, you absolutely CANNOT go off of your mood stabilizer (lamictal, lithium, depakote, etc) because bipolar is a progressive disorder. **This means each episode will get more and more severe unless treated—both the mania and the depression. ** And trust me, if you mess with or don’t take the appropriate meds, at a certain point you may very well likely either end up at the hospital at best or die by suicide. The black depression and mixed episodes are unbearable and very dangerous to yourself and perhaps others (in the case of mania). 

No one wants to hear this, I understand, but there is insurmountable evidence that bipolar is a *genetic based and hereditary* disorder. It is highly treatable but has no cure.

I hear so many stories from doctors who are ticked and devastated by patients who get better with lithium/meds but who refuse to keep taking them regularly due to *stigma* and side effects.

Please please do not, under any circumstance shame or encourage ppl to stop their meds unless you are that persons doctor. *Doctors* end up with some form of ptsd and burn out from the number of patients who go off their meds and end up dead. 
Relapses are also traumatizing in itself and it further complicates things. This is why so many people with bipolar have ptsd as well.

If you find the side effects intolerable, please discuss this with a doctor and work out other options.

I’m literally not bullshitting this. Here is a YouTube link to a talk by the most respected scholar in the field of mood disorders. (For more helpful literature, google “ Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison)


https://youtu.be/CxRLap9xLag




Further note: 

*it is also super important to get enough sleep and avoid drugs and alcohol. I used to make leeway with this and take my meds and still use recreational drugs thinking it was no big deal but they really mess with your medications. Another reason is because marijuana and alcohol interrupt your natural sleep cycle in a major way and contributes to further instability.

*research shows lithium is generally the most effective of the stabilizers despite being the oldest and unpopular medication. Thankfully it’s cheap as fuck.

*If you would like to know about my personal dealings with the disorder and feelings about medication, here’s the link to my [reply/comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/faxptx/bipolar_is_a_progressive_disorder_please_stay_on/fj2w2xs/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)  to a question asked about “why is lithium unpopular?”

*u/moodistry made a good [point](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/faxptx/bipolar_is_a_progressive_disorder_please_stay_on/fj1qixx/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) about how medication isn’t the only route towards healing and that alternative routes are equally valid which should not be shamed. I agree with them but want to add that while this is a valid point, medication is the *fastest* and most effective method of treatment for majority of people with bipolar disorder, especially in the most severe cases. Severe episodes will not be helped by alternative therapy, although I can see them being useful as adjunct treatment when a person is in a more stabilized state. But I am adamant about taking this to a professional first. Going off medication is very risky without proper handling.

* if you are uninsured and do not qualify for Medicaid, google for a free medication clinic near you, as well as sliding-scale clinics. Also, all big hospitals are required by law to take you into their ER regardless of your ability to pay and insurance status";r/BipolarReddit;487;125;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/faxptx/bipolar_is_a_progressive_disorder_please_stay_on/
2020-02-28 06:44:36;Real Intimacy AFTER Bipolar Diagnosis;"Edit 1:  Ty for the upvotes.  We appreciate it.  We would love to hear some success stories from some of you all.  It makes us feel like there is hope.  

I (29M) have been married to my wife (30F) for 10 years.  We have been together since we were 13 and she is the love of my life.  Through the years she has fought through depression and anxiety but I never waivered. Three SSRIs and therapy later and I'm still here.  But, our intimacy issues began slowly and creeped it's way in to some real serious issues.  She came off the meds and she was trying to do it by herself and in the process stopped all love and intimacy my way.  I felt alone and scared.  I felt insecure and I though maybe I was not doing enough.  So I started doing more, cleaning more, exercising more, cooking more, and no matter what I did she just kept retreating back into herself.  It was like I did not exist.  

This ended with a 6 month non intimacy streak where I broke down and let her know something was just wrong.  I didnt know what else I could do, and I asked if she had just fallen out of love.  I cried alot and so did she.  She said she didnt notice and that she would go back to the doctor's.  

Wouldnt you know it, she was put on A mood stabilizer and things got better each day.  Things were starting to get better.  She was happier, she was present, she cared about me.  We focused for months on our relationship without having sex and got back to a good base.  Things were looking up.

Then, I relized that the years of rejection coupled by the non-intamacy had caused me to lose all my self confidence and my ability to be intimate.   So over the next couple weeks we focused solely on her, and her sexual happiness.  This lead me to last night.

We were laying in bed cuddling.  She was rubbing my back and we were just snuggled in together.  SHE started kissing me.  Super slow kisses.  I could feel here fingers still running up and down my back and it felt amazing.  I felt connected.  Those slow kisses eventually led to more kisses and eventually led to the most amazing sex we have probally ever had.  It was the most organic sex.  She was present, she engaged me, she let me take my time due to my own anxiety.   We laid there for a while after and I was just so happy and she was so beautiful.  

I'm so happy Meds have brought back my wife, even if just for one night.  I could have died yesterday the happiest man in the world.

2020-02-25 04:17:42;Concerned for some of you - abuse is not bipolar disorder;"First post in here, for reference I am dating someone with bipolar disorder, we’ve been together for about 7 months, and my sister also has bipolar disorder, she was diagnosed about 7-8 years ago. In the posts I’ve read here I’m seeing a lot of people who are straight up being abused and mistaking that for symptoms of bipolar disorder. At the beginning of our relationship, my bf was pretty manipulative and would try to pull some of the same shit on me but I called him out on it and over time we have worked through it and he has changed. I know I’m lucky with my BF, will get into more detail about my sister at the end of the post.

We still have our issues and things to work on, but none of you should be verbally abused and manipulated to make you feel shitty for wanting to have your own life outside of them, and for not letting them walk all over you. Please know the difference between abuse and symptoms of bipolar disorder, if your SO is manic and being reckless or doing things unrelated to you that you don’t agree with, fine. Maybe they’re depressed and want to isolate themselves and you feel helpless, fine. But you should never tolerate people treating you like shit and using their bipolarity as an excuse, whether you yourself are making the excuse for them or they are. It’s not right and the longer you tolerate it, the less likely it is that they will ever stop. Something I’ve learned that has been helpful is constantly establishing boundaries, sometimes they change as the relationship changes and that’s fine, but you NEED to set boundaries for yourself and make them clear to your SO. If you never stand up for yourself (the post I’m thinking about right now is the guy who was looking for his gf’s hairbrush while she was berating him) they are going to push you as far as they can until you break. 

Your relationship will have a much better chance at surviving as well if you stand up for yourself and let them know what you will and will not tolerate. No one should be a punching bag just because their SO has a mental disorder. There’s a difference between having a genuine an argument about things in your relationship and someone just using you to get out their frustrations. 

I don’t mean to sound patronizing and I’m sure it comes across that way, but it’s been hard to read some of these posts of people getting verbally abused and chalking it up to “oh he/she had an episode/ I know they really love me/ he/she is just having a hard time.” And I’m sure some of you will say my bf and I haven’t been together long enough for me to know anything, but my sister (who I’ve been dealing with for nearly 8 years now) is a prime example of someone who used her mental illness as an excuse to treat my family and I like shit. She really made us believe that we are horrible people and that we never did anything for her (despite my parents supporting her when she was out of work for years, trying to get her into programs, going to the psychiatrist with her, me taking to her everyday and checking in on her and trying to talk through her issues, etc.) but I’ve recently come to the realization that she refuses to take responsibility for herself and just refuses to acknowledge any of the help we were trying to offer her. She physically assaulted my mom multiple times and my mom STILL let her move in with her in another state so she could have a fresh start. After a few weeks my sister had a tantrum and forced her bf (of 4 months) to drive to get in her the middle of the night and acted like she was kicked out. It’s a hard realization to come to, but just be careful and don’t lose yourself trying to help someone else, and don’t enable shitty behavior like my family and I did for years.";r/BipolarSOs;151;42;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/f8xddn/concerned_for_some_of_you_abuse_is_not_bipolar/

2020-02-05 01:20:28;It really pisses me off when people ask if I've taken my meds whenever I say I'm not doing well;"Seriously. Bipolar isn't the sole cause of all of my problems. I'm in remission and I still get suicidal and have extreme emotions (thanks BPD) that get the better of me. It's a struggle. It really is, and it feels incredibly invalidating to have things bothering me and have it all dismissed because I have this diagnosis. It's like they view every action I take as something to be pathologized. At least it really feels that way sometimes.

2019-09-25 07:32:03;I'm a psychologist with bipolar.;"For any health professionals who have a mental health condition, perhaps you can relate / commiserate?

A few months ago, I started to suspect i had bipolar II. I was going through a particularly rough patch in  my personal life, and the depressive and hypomanic episodes were becoming obvious. I was struggling and decided to confide in a friend/colleague.

Without saying a word to me about it, this colleague decided to report me to my boss. She had ""health concerns"" (relating to the issues I was having in my private life - not my work).

Next thing i know, my boss calls me into a meeting. Won't tell me what has been said about me (colleague's confidentiality is important), but wants to ensure i am seeking treatment for these ""health concerns"". I am. I've been seeing a psychologist for years, am on antidepressants, and I've been trying to seek support from friends. 

I feel pretty shattered by this exposure / vulnerability at work. I seek a voluntary hospital admission to keep myself safe, and hopefully to be reviewed and started on mood stabilizers.

Nurses and doctors in the hospital didn't  want to consider bipolar, because starting meds is something that should be done as an outpatient apparently. They ignore what I'm telling them and label me with borderline instead.

After hospital I managed to find a psychiatrist, get properly diagnosed and medicated. Things started looking up. I was stable, healthy, picking up the pieces.

Three months later - I get a call from the psychology board. That colleague had not only made my diagnosis public at work, but had also reported me to the psychology board. So they're now going to conduct an investigation into my mental health. 

The case worker tells me that they can't tell me what has been said (again, colleague's confidentiality is important). But they need in-depth letters from all my treating physicians, outlining things like my family/developmental history etc. so that they can decide whether I'm a risk to the public. 

Oh and they are currently looking through all my medical records. They apparently don't need my consent! They will simply access my hospital records and sift through every sensitive, personal issue I have ever divulged during treatment (thinking this would be confidential), while scrutinizing whether I can continue my career. In case I'm not being completely honest in my statement.

This news has an awesome effect on my mental health.

And now I continue to wait on the outcome of their investigation. Wondering what strangers on the board are going to learn intimate details about my complex trauma history. Wondering how my income and livelihood is going to be affected.

I feel like the lesson out of all this is that, as a psychologist, I'm not allowed to have a mental health condition. Or if I do, I need to keep it to myself so that I'm not publicly exposed, judged, punished. I feel like I don't have supports or therapists any more. Yeah I'll turn up to sessions because I have to, but how can I be anything other than ""good"" now? I don't have a right to privacy.

How disappointing to be treated so harshly by the very profession I've dedicated almost a decade of training to. Being treated like a threat to public safety, rather than somebody who's going through something, seeking support.

2019-08-31 00:56:56;You should know about the cycle of abuse and trauma bonding - and learn from my mistakes as an SO with a bipolar partner;"I didn't want to share my story but my therapist encouraged me to share, so that I can continue the healing process. I will share my story in hopes of keeping someone else from suffering like I did.

One year ago, I was knee-deep in a relationship with someone with Bipolar. We'll call him Mark. The relationship started years ago in a whirlwind of emotion and sparks, but little did we know at the time.. he was bipolar and in a manic swing. I also had undiagnosed ADHD which led me to make really emotional-based 
impulsive decisions, and affects memory.

One year into our relationship, I got my ADHD diagnosis, found treatment options, and my mental health was beautifully stable. Over the next few years, the disfunction of his undiagnosed bipolar led us to live in a [perpetual cycle of abuse](http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/cycle_of_abuse.html). When he got diagnosed, I thought that was great - he would get treatment, get his illness under control, and our lives would stabilize. The rollercoaster would turn into a car ride, at best. It wouldn't be a perfect journey but we would start to turn around and things would get better! Right? Right..? Nope.

Mark also played football in college and I suspect he had [CTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy). He was at the perfect age for symptoms to manifest - emotional disregulation, mood swings, anger issues, outbursts of rage, memory blanks. 

Because of the cyclical nature of bipolar and cycle of abuse, what ended up happening was [trauma bonding](https://www.abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Survivors/trauma_bonding.html). Initially, my undiagnosed ADHD kept me drawn to the drama like a moth to a flame. Even with treatment, ADHD is still a deeply emotional-disregulation-based disorder. The abuse cycle kept rewriting my memories and the ""good times"" encouraged me to stay.

For years, I was subjected to emotional abuse, physical abuse, threats, sexual abuse, sexual assault. I should have run away much earlier but I didn't. Because I also had a chronic debilitating illness, I was enmeshed in the relationship far longer than I should have been and totally dependent on him for care. I should have known better. I had been in abusive relationships before and swore I wouldn't ever let it happen again. I'm certain that the intense rollercoastering of bipolar, with the charm+energy+intense love of mania, clouded my judgement. 

""Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse."" He used his mental illness as an excuse for his shitty behavior and promised to go to therapy and do better. Except, he kept doing the same horrible things over and over again, without ever changing long-term. I think the longest stable period we had was 3 months. Just enough for me to let my guard down. Just enough time for me to have surgery, which backfired horribly, I couldn't have sex, and he sexually assaulted me multiple times from sexual frustration. He raped me when I was on pain medications which made me too tired and brainfogged to consent or understand what was happening. (The poor man, he was *suffering* cause he couldn't have depression-sex. /s) 

About 9 months ago I finally kicked him out. He had been sullen and withdrawn, classic depression symptoms. I wrote him a love note before I went to bed. When I woke up, I had a text from him soliciting a blowjob from me (lmao am I a booty call?). I noticed that one of my art pieces was moved to the coffee table. I started off by first telling him that texting me for a bj was degrading and rude. I asked him about my artwork. He said I wasn't finishing it ""Fast enough"" for him and he wanted to finish it for me. I do my artwork solo, ocassionally asking him for help on some tiny detail if my hands were too shaky, but taking it like that? No. I called him out on it. He blew up. He took my love note, crumpled it up and threw it away. He paced around the house, yelling and screaming about how he's never appreciated. He kept increasing his hostility and aggressive posturing. He slammed his hands on the kitchen counter and his eyes threw murderous daggers at me, and he just kept yelling all sorts of hurtful things. I told him to leave, or I would call the police. He left. Shortly after, I had a friend come over and she gave me a shoulder to cry on. She helped me understand what happened. That afternoon, I told him to take his things and leave, and never to come back. 

**Please don't put yourself on the back burner for someone else. If they aren't serious about changing their behavior or taking their health in their own hands, you can't convince them or love them more to convince them. Reach out to friends and family, don't isolate yourself from shame. Find a trusted therapist, find a support group. Educate yourself on [abusive relationships](https://www.abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Survivors/trauma_bonding.html). Hold your SO accountable for crossing boundaries. Have an exit plan if they have a history of becoming aggressive, hostile, dangerous. But most of all - always keep yourself, your health, your mental health, your safety and security, your boundaries as your priority.**";r/BipolarSOs;74;8;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/cxjnnw/you_should_know_about_the_cycle_of_abuse_and/

2019-05-13 23:41:14;Bipolar disorder can take years to learn how to manage. It’s not your fault for being in the wrong time of their lives.;"This is something I’ve realized after talking to an older friend about mental illness. My ex-SO was diagnosed at 18 with bipolar and is now 22. He’s had four years to accept the terrifying truth that he will never have a normal life, and go through some of the hardest things he has ever gone through for the first time. Putting myself in his shoes, I probably wouldn’t be doing well either. I shouldn’t expect him to have his disease completely figured out by now, and be able to effectively manage it as much as I want him to. And I guess knowing that I met him in a time of his life where he’s unable to hold down a serious relationship because of his mental illness is helpful in giving me a reason to accept this breakup. Maybe if he had years of experience in dealing with this, and understood his feelings better we would be together. But unfortunately I came into his life at a time where he hasn’t had enough time to figure his shit out. It’s hard to move on when you feel like you’re grasping for a reason why things didn’t work out. This is a valid reason. 

Hoping this post can give anyone else struggling through this a reason to move on. Forgive the world for the pain your SO goes through on a daily basis. Forgive the world for the pain you have gone through as a result. Accept that things didn’t work out because of timing. Your love wasn’t wasted. It was just given at a time where your SO wasn’t in the right place to accept all of it. Try and take care of yourself the way you want your SO to take care of themselves.";r/BipolarSOs;107;12;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/bo52y5/bipolar_disorder_can_take_years_to_learn_how_to/
2019-04-26 08:17:04;I have really good news and no one to tell!!!;"I’m 20 and was diagnosed bp2 by a free therapist at my university when I was 18. I have health insurance through my parents, but they don’t believe in mental health, so I could never seek real treatment. Even HIPPA doesn’t apply because my bills and stuff would still have been sent to their house, and there was no way for me to change the billing address. So I’ve been cycling pretty much non stop for 2 years!!!!! I gave up hope of ever being able to be on medication or receive real therapy. This whole mess has caused me to be so isolated my whole first two years of college, receive horrible grades, etc. 

A few months ago during a horrible depressive episode I emailed my school’s student support services and asked if there was anyway I would qualify for a grant for the student health care. It’s $2000 a year, ontop of a $36,000 tuition and I’m paying for my own school so there was no way I could afford it. I explained I had been diagnosed bipolar and was barely coping. I didn’t hear back from them for months so I kinda forgot about it. Well today I got an email, they gave me a full grant to cover it for the rest of my time in school! So I have free health insurance now, allowing me to get a real therapist, psychiatrist, and even go to a normal doctor for free. I can’t even express how crazy this is. I literally cried with joy when I got the email. I was sooo so hopeless and giving up on all my dreams, and now I have a way to get healthy again.

2018-12-15 01:34:42;Wanting to distance our disorder from bipolar people who “act crazy” is ignorant. The fact is that bipolar CAN make you crazy and CAN take over who you are as a person. Saying anything else is only perpetuating the stigma. Maybe we need to distinguish between bp II and bp I;"Look, I get a lot of you are bipolar II and have never experienced true mania or psychosis. But closing your eyes and sticking your fingers in your ear anytime there is evidence that someone with bipolar said and did really shitty things doesn’t negate the fact that these are often SYMPTOMS of the disorder. Can we at least distinguish them as symptoms as opposed to personality traits.

Just because your symptoms are less doesn’t mean you are a better person. Telling someone that it is their fault their an ass when psychotic is like telling someone it is their fault they have no energy when depressed. And telling someone they need to learn to “manage their symptoms” better—for fucks sake, everyone knows that is near impossible to manage all episodes. What if someone told you that when you were depressed?

I’m going to use Kanye West as an example. People in the BP community went into an uproar because they didn’t want to be associated with someone who is displaying absolute signs of severe mania bordering on psychosis. What are you trying to say? That he was in complete control of himself and is responsible for all of his actions?

There is a disconnect between people who have less severe forms of BP being “disgusted” by what the severe manifestation of this disease looks like. And there is a lot of ignorance. How many posts are there about “weeee I’m hypomanic I love this” and then berating someone in the media for being manic and claiming that they have a gift. Just because mania manifests itself productively in some of your lives doesn’t mean that is the case for everyone. Imagine your hypomania keeps going up and up and up, you’re having so much fun and then BANG! Psychosis hits. 

Mania and psychosis CAN make you into a shitty person. That doesn’t mean it’s the persons fault. My mother has psychotic episodes about once a year DESPITE weekly doctors appointment and staying consistent with her meds. In her psychotic episodes she calls the CPS on my siblings, claims my dad has raped everyone, steals and pawns all of our stuff, and manipulated everyone causing excessive trauma. 

Do I blame her? Not anymore than I’d blame a cancer patient for extreme fatigue. This is a CHARACTERIZING SYMTPOM OF OUR DISEASE. I’m sorry that you don’t want to be associated with “crazy,” but guess what! You have the benefit of being BP II and will never have to experience the ruin that comes from psychosis. So instead of stigmatizing a traumatic stmptom, maybe count your blessings that you have the lack of experience that lead you to be so ignorant about the disorder. 


I have been downvoted by saying that having BP will likely lead your children to trauma. Guess what guys? If you have psychosis you will inevitably leave trauma on your family. Maybe you take offense because your bipolar isn’t “that bad,” but anyone who has experienced psychosis will readily admit to this. Just as anyone who has cancer will probably come to terms with the trauma their illness is causing on others. Because anything that is THAT severe is going to have serious impacts!

You are not better than other bipolar people because your symptoms are less. It doesn’t mean that you have a better handle on things, that you’re more responsible, that you are a nicer person. Someone who is psychotic is not less than you, they aren’t a shitty person, it’s not because they aren’t trying. 

I think these diseases should honestly be called something altogether. Adding psychosis into the mix is closer to schizophrenia than it is bpII. But a lot of people don’t seem to recognize this.

For the record, I am BP II so I get that depression is hard. But unless you’ve witnessed or experienced psychosis or severe mania, you have no right in judging others.
 
EDIT: Okay, apparently I triggered a lot of bpII people. Look, if you have never judged someone for psychosis, then just ignore this post completely, this was all it was made for. No I am not saying that bipolar II people have it easy or that they are ""less than"" a bp I diagnosis. I'm BP II, I've been hospitalized, I've lost jobs, I've lost relationships. This isn't about one diagnosis being ""better"" than another. It's about people who have no experience with psychosis thinking that psychosis is just an extension of their hypomania.

And yes, I'd argue BP I is a more severe condition. I'm not saying that your bpII is easy. I get it. I have been on the verge of suicide multiple times. However, my mother gets crippling depression, but guess what else she gets? Psychosis. She is completely dependent on me and my family. What people don't understand is that BPI is, by it's nature, more severe than bp II--in fact bp II can ""turn into"" bp I if the symptoms get more severe. But in reality, I never should have mentioned these diagnostic terms since that's all they are to begin with. This post was simply about psychosis, and about those who have never experienced psychosis outwardly judging those who have.";r/BipolarReddit;170;96;https://reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/a66xef/wanting_to_distance_our_disorder_from_bipolar/
