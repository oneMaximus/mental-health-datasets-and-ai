2025-11-08 21:25:36;How is this not just extreme PTSD and BPD;"Before you say anything I was chronically r*ped as a child for years. 

I live in the UK and was diagnosed with CPTSD. Before that, I was diagnosed with EUPD (BPD) - it was removed.

I have severe chronic PTSD symptoms plus the emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties (avoidance), and chronic worthlessness/emptiness. 

But CPTSD has consumed my entire personality. I am nothing outside of CPTSD. I have no real personality or sense of self, hobbies, or anything. I have no job, no real friends or a relationship. I am consumed by trauma symptoms.

Also I have problems with bingeing, body image, SH, substance abuse, overspending, putting myself in weird situations. I’ve gone through cycles of to starving/purging to suppress PTSD symptoms. I don’t know if I like or am disgusted by someone, I go back and forth - I’m comforted, I’m threatened. 

I’m so confused how this doesn’t basically mean CPTSD gave me BPD 

edit: why are ppl deliberately missing my point and getting mad. i’m literally professionally diagnosed with CPTSD

like why can't you explain why you're offended instead of downvoting me when i talk about hating or punishing myself bc of my trauma, or feel that my sense of self has been destroyed by trauma. i never called you Evil Borderlines (i'm not demonising bpd either)";r/CPTSD;4;18;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1orpcto/how_is_this_not_just_extreme_ptsd_and_bpd/
2025-11-08 20:57:45;Toxic work environment;"Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I was diagnosed with CPTSD after losing my mother, 4 years ago. I still struggle with both, the grief & CPTSD (among other things) and my mother’s death anniversary is next week. 

Usually, I can keep it together enough to show up to work… but right now my work environment has become toxic due to an erratic co worker & their attitude. 

I called out yesterday, and was sent a warning message that if something is going on with me I need to fix it. 

But I don’t have full time hours, and they don’t even offer insurance so I can’t get medication… let alone I don’t WANT to be on medication full time. 

I just have times that are harder than others and I worry I won’t get any grace for that at my work place. My managers also push themselves to the limit and usually expect the rest from everyone else, but I can’t hold myself to that standard because it’s been proven in the past not to be helpful for me. 

Ugh… I just need someone to tell me they relate and it will be okay please ";r/CPTSD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ororp2/toxic_work_environment/
2025-11-08 19:06:11;Trauma and strange behavior?;"I hope this is allowed. I was wondering if I could get some opinions on what’s been going on with my girlfriend who has been through significant trauma. 

For some backstory, my girlfriend was assaulted while she was repeatedly saying no and a different person tried to coerce her into sexual activity after that aswell. She never actually got justice or therapy for what happened, but she said that she thinks it still affects her. 

As a teenager she attempted by taking a heart medication, was involuntarily committed for physical self harm, and overdosed on multiple other medications. She isn’t diagnosed, but her dad has autism and she believes she may be high functioning autistic. She didn’t tell me this until we’d been talking for maybe 2 months and she acted completely normal. She seems very friendly, calm, affectionate, understanding, and kind.

I just wanted to put some context on her behavior. She apparently feels constantly dissociated from reality, engages with people strategically, fakes emotions, and has lied about important details like age, birthday, and last name. Hasn’t been friends with another person in 3 years (she told me she had a couple friends at first.) She admitted this to me herself and said she was sorry and that she would be more genuine. She said she lied because she assumed I would leave eventually and she felt like it would be easier to disconnect herself from the relationship if she didn’t share personal details.

Apparently her past ex would also outright call her “fucking unreasonable” for not sleeping with him, even though he knew about her past trauma, so maybe she doesn’t have a good understanding of relationships. 

Im not really sure what to think of this whole Thing. I was hoping I could get some second opinions who could see the situation more
objectively. ";r/CPTSD;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ormr96/trauma_and_strange_behavior/
2025-11-08 18:48:29;I need to know. I'm so exhausted.;"I'll just start from the beginning, because it's been with me forever. I've had these thoughts since early childhood. Idk if it's ptsd or just thoughts that following me my whole life and I think almost daily about, depends on the mood. But I need a break man. 

I grew up as a minor celebrity in my area, and part of the surrounding neighborhoods where I grew up. Sounds weird, it was weird. My grandmother had a business, so everyone knew her, my mother, and obviously me. People I'd never seen before would constantly approach me, but they knew me through my grandmother. But if that were all it was, it would be a funny anecdote.

My mother, even though she would never admit it, denies 90% of what I'm about to write. The consequences of her childhood on me are still there.

Because her mother ran the business, she was hardly ever around and was always with other men. My mother received very little love and had to beg for it. All she had was status and money... and some random guys her mother did... whatever with. My mother went to school with a few hundred bucks and bought clothes and things like that for herself and her friends. Status and money were what bought her love.

So when I was born, I was apparently THE model child. Ultra beautiful, blond, blue eyes. My mother said she got modeling contracts for me as a baby/toddler. Even though that could just be lying for status. 

  


And so it began, in elementary school. My grades weren't so good, I had problem holding focus. I'm now diagnosed with ADHD since a few years. My mother told me then she doesn't believes me and she played with the thought i had ADHD as a child, that's why all this experimental stuff to help me I was going through, but she was ashamed if I had it, because there was a lot wrong with me and that would just be another thing. As you can imagine, she denies ever having said that, even though it was only a few years ago. 

For some reason, I became afraid of getting fat, and my mother thought I was getting fat, or already was fat. Idk. I remember being so afraid of getting fat after a TV report that I ran into my parents bedroom in tears at night. All I know is it was always in the air. Almost every morning, while I was dressed myself, she would stand in the doorway, just staring at me and shaking her head in disappointment. I was so afraid of being shirtless. I thought I was fat, even though I wasn't. Now I am.

And this hell went on for almost nine years. I was demoted from one education grade level to a lower one, the lowest, and reasons were found to portray me as an idiot. Everything I did wrong was immediately grounds for criticism. I'll never forget when we went on vacation with her friends and family, and for what felt like forever, all they talked about was how stupid I was. She didn't have a better school education either, by the way, but status was the most important thing to her when it came to her friends. When we stopped, my father came to me in an instant and hugged me. From my mothers pov, of course, that never happened. That was the story, until she realized, my father remembers it very well, too. Now it happened but SHE wasn't part of it and didn't laugh. II really can't remember much, it was going on for almost 9 years but some things, they are burned into my brain. 

I also like the argument she slowly drops, that I had everything. Yes, that's true. I had a lot, I was spoiled. But that was also the language of love she knew best. How often did I skip school so we could go to the movies or out to eat? Wtf, what was that even? I just realize. How did we get into these situations? It happened a lot and my father wasn't allowed to know. One time a teacher was eating in the same resturants as us, and we tried to hide from him. 

As I said, I've forgotten a lot from my childhood. I only know that I lived under constant stress. I was terrified of the phone for example because it was usually her best friend. Her son was my childhood best friend, and he told her everything, and she told my mother. I was always afraid of doing something wrong. I built a wall of indifference that was never real until a certain age. I've always tried to be indifferent to everything, because then nobody could hurt me.

I was afraid to play sports because I thought I'd be laughed at, because of an handicap. Tbf, she never teased me about it. But I was scared it would happen and so I was also scared of others doing it to me. I remember joking comments from ger, which really weren't mean, because of my running. That's burned into my brain. I was afraid to do anything that would have been good for me. I really believed school was the problem. I never fully understood, until I was 13 or 14, that it was my mother. I think the realization began when my father used me as his therapist. For quite the time. It was all about my mother. At some point, I told him I couldn't do that with him anymore. My father is the best and cutest person in the world, but I think he still resents ever doing that with me.

Most of the time, I just escaped into games and fictional worlds. Because there I felt safe, even though that was exactly what she hated. I could also immerse myself in other people, I will come to that. I really have so much just deleted from my mind. I know in the final years, she just sat on the sofa with her laptop and wasn't there. She was extremely unhappy. She had multiple affairs, with good earning men, and finally left my father when I was about 15. That brought no peace, because I destroyed my father during the five years we still lived together. I regret that. He was dying, both physically and mentally. And I think I'm still doing it.

  
I haven't mentioned the most important detail yet. Around the age of six, the urge developed to not be myself. I wanted to be someone else. A different person. That's what I think about almost every day. Over the years I've gotten better at dealing with it, but it destroys me so much. When I'm in good phases, I cope really well. In bad phases, like now, I just't want be overwritten by anyone and so not be me. That's triggered also some really shitty kinks in me and everything else around it. It's so stupid. I'm so fed up. I'm exhausted.

  
And it's not getting any better because I've become everything my mother didn't want me to  be. Every fear in her became true. I abused psychedelics in my late teens and early twenties. They made me feel like I achieved what I'm always thinking about every day since my childhood: not being myself, giving up control. They completely screwed me over. I'm still processing it. I'm unable to work, I simply can't. I'm fat. I can't accomplish anything and it's driving me crazy. The smallest things overwhelm me, and then this urge comes over me to simply be not me. And I don't even hate myself as a person, I just can't handle everything around it. And I know where it comes from, and being angry with my mother won't get me anywhere. Even though I hate that she denies so much. I know where she comes from. I believe she has surely some form of a trauma, for sure. If not from her childhood, then from her ex-boyfriend who almost killed her. She jumped out the window from the second floor to escape him, which is why she's still so easily scared.

Luckily, I have good friends. And interests that... well, lately a friend has gotten me into an interest which kinda destroys me and heals me at the same time. But in general, I am self aware about what I am but I can't handle myself

I'm also so good at selling people a version of myself that doesn't exist. I'm still prone to substance abuse. But I try not to.

But I have this kind of non-existent state I can myself put in, at least partially. I can just don't smoke for 1 or 2 month, I did it before. It's a state where I simply ignore what I want or what I feel. It's the wall I was faking as a child. I can just... disconnect for days or weeks. For some reason I can stop things so easily, but starting them is impossible. 

Well, that's not all but a bit.  

I will delete this post later. ";r/ptsd;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ormglj/i_need_to_know_im_so_exhausted/
2025-11-08 17:27:17;How do I know I’m not transitioning as a trauma response to years of complete societal rejection and isolation?;"I was bullied a lot in elementary and middle school for the way I looked (red hair, freckles, lazy eye, crooked teeth) and for what I realize now was probably autistic and/or ADHD behavior — I've never been officially diagnosed.

My attempts to make friends and socialize weren't completely thwarted until middle school and the start of puberty. I was constantly picked on, physically harassed, and even jumped once on my way home by a group of boys two grades above me. I can’t remember many — or any — of the details about why these things happened to me, which is why I'm left to assume.   
  
By the time high school came, it had mostly stopped. People moved on and started to mature, but the damage to my confidence and sense of self was already done.

I spent my entire four years of high school flunking every class, watching YouTube and browsing the internet on my school-issued MacBook. I didn’t really talk to anyone outside of necessity, much less participate in any kind of extracurricular activities or socialization. I somehow ended up graduating thanks to online makeup classes and Quizlet.

___

The next three years after high school are a blur of much of the same. Most days consisted of some mix of youtube, discord, reddit, twitch, twitter and anime.

I did pick up digital art for a bit, and I became a lot more politically cognizant. During high school I went from a “groyper” (sans the actual nazism) to “enlightened centrist,” before luckily having my full woke awakening in this time during the pandemic.

Those are about the only two useful things I did that entire time though. The number of times I left my mom's apartment could probably be counted on two hands, but I was content with that. I was perfectly fine just existing in Section 8 housing and living off food stamps for the rest of my life. As long as I had my PC and some access to the internet.

___

Fast forward to July 2022, and I’d decided to finally go to college at 21 years old. I got accepted into a middle-of-the-road party school, but a degree was a degree for me.

I wanted to move out of the country, and doing so without a bachelor’s degree would be practically impossible for someone in my situation. Part of it, too, was that my mom's and my relationship was kind of starting to fall apart.

She was an alcoholic, and like most, they have their good moments and their bad moments — their periods of sobriety and their relapses. Though for the past year, things had just been continually getting worse. She was arrested a couple of times, in and out of the hospital every few months, and it eventually started to get physical between us. So I decided the best option would be for us to stop living together.

___

Not even a semester into college, I got the call that my mom died. I’m still not sure how to put that into words, so I mostly haven't.

The following year and a half looked eerily similar to the years before college. I flunked out and took on student loan debt for nothing. I got into weed for a few months until I overdid it and it started making me feel low-key schizophrenic.

I didn’t really interact with anyone in person, didn’t go out unless for food or the couple psych visits. I avoided my roommates pretty much entirely, only encountering them a handful of times. They probably thought I was weird as fuck.

___

I had no opinions on my gender at all until I was about 17. Even then, it wasn’t ever anything serious — just a “haha, what if I was born as a girl” here and there. Not exactly a question born of yearning, always a short little stupid thought experiment.

I was still very much a cis-man in my mind. I didn’t give it any real thought until the beginning of last year, when I was 23. I can’t remember what set it off. Probably a mix of depression, weed, and the introspection both of those bring on.

I spent weeks diving deep into everything about being transgender. I read thousands of stories from trans people on this subreddit and others. I found the dysphoria bible and read that, did the button test, and started to relate — to all of it.

I looked into de-transition stories to rule out the possibility that I could be making a mistake, but no. I knew what I was getting into with HRT, and I was completely on board. I came out to my friends online, chose a name and new pronouns, then started HRT that same month.

___

The first three months of HRT, even though the physical changes were minor, I remember not hating what I was seeing in the mirror for the first time in my life.

I was having epiphanies what felt like every day. This is why I changed in the stalls in the locker room. This is why I hated the sound of my own name. This is why I despised my voice despite everyone telling me it was completely normal. This is why I thought my face was just fucking deformed.

I could see a future in which I could be genuinely happy.

Then my refills ran out, and I got depressed again, and I lost my job, and then my apartment.

The only friend I’ve had since seventh grade let me crash with him after I was evicted last September, and that’s where I’ve been since — boymoding because I’d be out on the street if he knew.

I’m coming up on a year back on HRT, and it’s still surreal to look in the mirror and actually like what I see most of the time. There are still things I’d like to change, but I know HRT takes time — and hopefully, FFS is in my future. Over this past year, I’ve managed to hold a job longer than three months for the first time in my life. I’ve rediscovered my passion for music and art, and even went to my first concert. For the first time, I have real plans for my life, and I want to see them through.

___

The only thing stopping me from fully accepting my trans identity is the tinge of regret I feel when seeing old pictures. Feeling like maybe I wasn't that bad looking or maybe I could make being a boy work. Or I see someone that resembles my pre-transition self online and they're happy. But that comes and goes, and from what I've read is quite common — at least the first part.   
  
I could go off HRT to see how that makes me feel, but I don't want to lose progress. That fact should be all the proof I need.

Would it not stand to reason that I’m transitioning as a way to run from an identity and a life I was never accepted in? That maybe the reason I like what HRT is doing to me isn’t because it’s making me *me*, but because it’s facilitating my escape from who I used to be?";r/CPTSD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1orl5mb/how_do_i_know_im_not_transitioning_as_a_trauma/
2025-11-08 14:45:42;I minimised my abuse in my own mind - to survive?;"I suffered severe sexual, physical, psychological  abuse as a young adult for 5 years - I was in a relationship with a man that I’ve just seen sentenced to 29 years in prison for his offending. He is a diagnosed narcissistic psychopath, sadistic and very nearly killed me twice. He hurt other women too. 
Cut me up with a kitchen knife to ‘make me a virgin again’ . Fucking grim.
Yet in my mind I always thought - it wasn’t that bad, he never murdered me.
Maybe I minimised the abuse just to get through my daily life… maybe to justify to myself why I didn’t go to the police… maybe just so I could compartmentalise it all and bury it deep inside…? Probably all of these things 

23 years after the abuse started, and after living my whole adult life completely emotionally numb, I’ve decided to start my healing journey.
Now that he’s finally gone to rot in prison it’s time to face my past 😩

2025-11-08 11:28:25;is it even worth getting diagnosed?;"everything is pointing towards me having cptsd. every single thing. but 
1. i’m too scared to bring it up. i don’t have a psych or therapist i’m seeing at the moment and this probably won’t change for atleast another 6-8 months. and i definitely don’t wanna bring this up w someone i don’t know at all/that doesn’t know me and my symptoms so far. 
2. i really think that if i do manage to figure it out and get diagnosed, i’m gonna regret it. i’m gonna hate myself. i’ve hated myself every day since i got diagnosed w bpd 7 years ago bcs it ruined everything. it made me feel like i could identify a certain way and relate to a certain group of people which i thought would be so helpful but it quite literally made everything worse. 

i’m just scared. i’m ALSO scared of being told i don’t have it and that it’s just the damn bpd bcs i know i’ll lose all hope. i’ve had this shitty diagnosis for almost a decade and nothing has changed. if it really is just the bpd, i give up. i don’t know what more to do, how much harder i need to try bcs nothing works, nothing helps. 

thougt i would add this here bcs i managed to make a post and i’ve been too tired and scared to talk about this - without getting into too much detail, life has been shitty, horrible but not what one would call traumatic. diagnosed narcissist for a dad, a child for a mom - its not been easy. but it’s so hard bcs my dad is somehow the person i’ve trusted the most in the past couple years, while he’s also been his most emotionally abusive self these past couple years. my question is - i’ve never been abused physically. ever. i’ve only been tortured emotionally for almost a decade now + life has not been easy - i’ve been bullied for multiple years, i have bpd so theres a lot of consequences to that. ugh i’m bad at this but i just need to know if cptsd can exist without actual trauma trauma.

2025-11-08 09:29:34;Does life get better? tw: suicidal thoughts;"It's been five months since I had a near death experience in which I found myself alone in the situation and not being able to ask for help. I had to save myself; and somehow I survived, because I froze and almost let myself die. A week later I started going to therapy, my body was replaying the symptoms I had during the event and also started having panic attacks (which I never had em before). Sadly, the psychologist was not the best one; he never adressed the trauma and made me think it was all in my head. I developed fear of eating food and trying medicine. It got worse and even applying creams was and is a crippling fear of mine. 

For over a month I felt like I was not supposed to be here, that I was stealing someone else's spot on Earth and there was a countdown for me waiting to make another appointment with death itself. I got a new psychologist and everybody thinks I am doing better but I am having the same exact thoughts I used to have when I was diagnosed with depression at a young age (13yo) and it feels like I just learned how to hide the pain and live with it. 

I have tried reaching out to the only two people I can rely on, but none of them seemed to understand the process I am going through and at times I get this thought of ""well, if this happens again there is no one I am truly leaving behind so I shouldn't be worrying about that and I will not fight this time"". It is worrying me a bit to start thinking about letting myself die, when all I've been wanting the past five months is quite the opposite. I usually keep quiet with the things I'm struggling with but I've been telling people how I am feeling lately and even when I am being extremely detailed ""I am feeling depressed and wanting to hurt myself again"" the feedback is mostly ""that's not normal, talk to your psychologist about it, i hope you feel better soon"". 

I have tried doing everything at hand; therapy, exercise 3-4 times per week, walk, breathing exercises, praying, finding a new community and nothing seems to erase the scar this event left behind. I miss the girl I was five months ago. I was not afraid of eating new food, I was not afraid of trying make up products I have always wore or even taking medicine. I was not scared of living and terrified of wasting my life this way. 

I am a new christian and I truly believe if I am still here it is because of Him, not me; but even sinning gives me anxiety because I think my life could be taken away at any time and not being able to repent scares me.

  
Just to clarify, I would never try to attempt anything; it is just the thought of not really trying to survive next time something similar happens. I am usually pretty over protective with myself, I do my best to stay healthy physically and psychologically, but this time it's over my head.

  
Does life get better at some point? Or is this going to haunt me till my last day on Earth?

2025-11-08 09:00:37;Can I get traumatized from something consensual?;"[NSFW] Little bit of backstory before I start: I was a victim of assault at 14 by the hands of someone I trusted a lot; my bestfriend's father. I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it. Also, I'm 20 now.

Ever since then I had trouble with sexual topics or themes and always removed myself from the picture, but with time I managed to slowly start being more open with the concept, I still avoided being intimate with anyone, until one day I decided to try something out with strangers, not in person but online, so I could control my own situation, and I ended up sending a bunch of people photos of myself, it was all consensual but I think it triggered something in me since through most of it I felt disgustingly degraded and I ended up crying a lot.

Since then it feels like something snapped, and my ""near sex-repulsion"" turned to what I can only describe as hypersexuality, I did the same thing again and spent hours of most of my days being intimate with myself until I physically couldn't do it anymore, and even went so far as to upload videos on porn websites, only to take them down days later.

This went on for a three months and I'm now starting to calm down and seemingly go back to being more detached with sexual topics involving myself, except that half of me is in some twisted way hoping to be assaulted again but much worse than last time, this feeling was not there before and it scares me a lot since I don't ACTUALLY want that to happen.

I think part of it is because I hate seeing myself sexually and maybe that part of me wants it to happen again so I can hopefully further detach myself from sex, especially after all the consensual recent stuff I just mentioned, and I know part of me also feels like my assault isn't valid enough and that I need more to consider myself a survivor.

But I hate having these thoughts because it makes me feel guilty, I also suspect to have something along the lines of OCD and these thoughts are terrifying to me because it feels like just half assedly """"hoping"""" for it greatly increases the chances of it actually happening.

Is it possible for something consensual to traumatize someone? I think the first picture sending session might've done something to me, could that be the case?";r/ptsd;10;8;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1orbw0m/can_i_get_traumatized_from_something_consensual/

Sometimes if a trigger hits REALLY deep and or I get triggered multiple times in a short period I start to freak out intensely. It’s not often but it usually happens when something in my now healthy relationship makes my brain mistake being “trapped”. I quite literally start to panic and don’t really see things for how they are. I convince myself I’m being abused again (I’m definitely not) and I truly just don’t function for up to a week or two and function while almost fully dissociating. I noticed that anytime my partner makes me feel any type of emotion outside of happy/loved or neutral it really sends me into these episodes. It’s HORRIBLE. I know how to break them but it’s very hard and painful to get through. I have lots of space from my boyfriend as he is a fire fighter which is great and terrible all at once. I tend to stay in a secure attachment (after so much healing and work)  but during these “episodes” I flip flop back and forth between anxious and avoidant. I’m wondering if anyone else struggles with this. It’s like I am a (mostly) functioning human being with a grip on life and a handle on my cptsd and then boom…totally non functioning, frozen, scared, and confused and sometimes furious. If anyone else experiences this I would love to know as it might help me feel more of a sense of peace when my reality feels blurred. Or does anybody manage triggers and then shut down for some certain ones? It’s hard not to feel crazy. I also struggle with relationship ocd and general ocd as a result of everything. ;r/CPTSD;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1orblzh/does_anyone_else_have_episodes/
2025-11-08 08:37:33;How Many Of Us Have A Personality Disorder?;"Kindly block me if you think narcissist = abuser or believe in narcissistic abuse, you are an unsafe person to me.

Anyway how many of us have a personality disorder? I'm not asking about misdiagnosis as I'm aware that's very common with CPTSD women/afabs and BPD, I'm asking about actual personality disorders you have that you agree with having and how they present in you. What struggles do you have healing CPTSD alongside a personality disorder?

I have avoidant personality disorder as my main diagnosis which I believe to be moderate (using ICD 11 scale), I am basically a poster child for this disorder- low self esteem in regards to socialisation/self hatred, self blame, completely isolated except my family, solitary hobbies, extreme fear of rejection and criticism. 

My secondary diagnosis is narcissistic personality disorder which I consider mild. My main symptom is grandiosity where I think I'm better than the average person, I struggle a lot with jealousy over people who are able to have friends and live a normal life (Im disabled) but also think people are jealous of me lol, I want praise/admiration which my few online friends n therapist give to me. I am obviously very sensitive to criticism/rejection and I'm prone to anger but I'm getting much better at it. I have a lot of shame and fear of vulnerability. 

I actually have hyper-empathy and deeply care about others so sharing my diagnosis of NPD given the pop psychology demonisation of the disorder is really difficult but I feel you can't truely understand me unless you know about my NPD since it makes up a massive piece of my sense of self. I wish ppl understood you need 5/9 criteria and only one involves abusive/toxic behaviour but even if someone was abusive they deserve space and support to change as they get treatment for their disorder. I have a core belief of being this horrible evil person and it's only reinforced by the narc abuse crowd despite my therapists best efforts to convince me I'm a good person.

Would love to hear from other cluster Bs who understand the demonisation.";r/CPTSD;2;32;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1orbe1n/how_many_of_us_have_a_personality_disorder/

2025-11-08 03:34:28;Why do I attract abusive people?;"Hi y'all, first time poster here!
I'm almost 30 soon and have been in therapy almost all my teen and adult life so far cause of multiple issues.

Ever since I can remember I've had a hard time with others. I have ADHD and also likely autism, which only got diagnosed only a few years ago, tho I always knew there was something different about me. I guess many of my issues stem from that. I had a hard time finding friends and socializing, I got excluded in social events, got bullied in school and even had trouble with family members. While much of it can be attributed to the adhd there is an issue that I just cannot find any explanation for: I have a long history of abusive relationships both platonic and romantic. It's like I magically attract abusive people.


In school I was mostly by myself, besides a few people who were also considered weirdos I only had ""friends"" who had fun ridiculing me in various ways for their amusement. The first girl who showed interest in me romantically turned out to just be pretending and secretly told my entire grade that I'm gay (not great at that time) by showing text messages and even shared a sort of revealing photo of me online. It was downhill from then, but the ways people found to abuse me are genuinely sort of ridiculous. I had a best friend who went on vacation and when she returned two weeks later I was suddenly her number one worst enemy. She told people I use hard drugs, that I am a liar, that I'm a horrible person. She made it her entire life's mission to tell everyone, including adding all my Facebook friends and my new school friends of a school I had just changed to. I lost all of our common friends at that time too and it took me almost 10 years to get over it. Then I got into my first relationship with a guy who was mostly verbally abusive. He called me dumb and lazy for many years and did his best to convince me that I couldn't trust myself at all, this includes my memory. I still suffer from distrusting myself a lot, my first instinct is always to question my own memories. It took a while but a few years in he had fully isolated myself and started hitting me too. I managed to leave him with a stroke of luck as I had found a new group of friends he couldn't manipulate. I thought finally this would be over but I was very much mistaken. I don't actually have the capacity to write what followed, because it all feels blurry. My brain seems to actively be repressing most of my memories most of the time... To make it short: I spend my early twenties getting drunk to cope and ended up being sexually assaulted multiple times. Eventually I managed to have a nice boyfriend for a while but fucked it up because the whole thing felt bizarre. It was fully self destructive. After that I accidentally managed to get myself involved in what I can only describe as a political cult, needless to say that ended horribly. I had to move because they kept harassing me via Mail and once again I lost almost all the friends I had. At the same time I got involved in a short relationship with someone I can only describe as a monster. He mentally abused me and just used me as an ATM. I broke it off and somehow got into another relationship basically immediately, which I try to avoid doing usually. That person has BPD and while they are in treatment I spend the last years subconsciously walking on eggshells. I thought it was a wonderful relationship mostly, idk I have a hard time understanding what I feel and didn't realize how much it did to me. I did once again lose a good potion of my friends because of my partner, tho to be very fair it was because said friends turned out to be very bigoted. The ex left me out of the blue earlier this year, after having talked about children, marriage etc. Even in the weeks beforehand. When they dumped me they told me that they see me as lesser than them, that I was not equally as capable as them. They also told me that they had set a deadline almost a year earlier and that I should consider myself ""honored"" that they actually stayed with me a month longer. There were other bizarre things said during the breakup. I was in shambles and haven't spoken to them since, besides one time where they were very cold which made my heart break once again. 

Now I'm almost 30 and my heart it in shambles. I am yet again trying to teach myself how to trust people after having that trust broken deeply so many times. I have more stable friends now, but I am constantly in fear that everything will break apart again. The thought of my life continuing like this is exhausting. The past ~15 years of my life was spend searching for connection, someone who loves and cares for me as much as I do then. I don't want this to go on anymore. 

Something about me has to be the cause of these people entering my life and I want to find what it is. I don't think that it's because of something that's bad about me, but clearly I need to make a change. I cannot get my heart broken again because I am already so worn out. Does anybody have similar experiences and maybe some tips? Advice on what it could be that seemingly invites these people into my life? I just want to be able to live me life without the fear that every friendship, every relationship I make will eventually use me, abuse me and throw me away

Thank you so much for all the input! I got overwhelmed with how many comments there are, I am reading through them right now but I probably won't answer all of them because it's a lot lol but really thank you!";r/CPTSD;53;35;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1or3xmk/why_do_i_attract_abusive_people/

2025-11-08 02:19:24;Feeling vulnerable;I (20F) don’t remember almost anything. But the feelings come back, the fear of being seen, of being naked. I don’t remember anything, but the emotions are so intense I want to curl up in a ball and cry. I feel disgusting. And I can’t even tell me my mom, my main support person, because I don’t have any proof, and it would fuck up the family. So I’m just living with this feeling that my brother may have molested me and I hate it because I don’t remember anything. He (22M) physically, psychologically, and emotionally abused me from as young as I can remember until I was around 11. Then we stopped interacting for 6 years. As I worked through my trauma and was diagnosed with CPTSD, I slowly reintroduced myself to him again. While I don’t love him, I also don’t hate him. I’m indifferent. He’s not worth my time or energy, and he can’t hurt me anymore. But I’m so hurt and raw, especially after starting therapy again. Once a week just isn’t enough. I don’t think I’ll ever tell my family. I have no proof, and I don’t think they’ll believe me.

2025-11-08 02:07:13;how does cptsd show up in your relationships?;"i feel like my struggles in romantic relationships and maintaining close friendships stems from my complex ptsd. i used to sit in therapy sessions and lament about my mind, searching for a label to define my behaviors. i so badly wanted a bpd diagnosis to explain my ""splits"" on myself and the world around me whenever i felt betrayed. my talk therapist diagnosed me with cptsd two nights ago and told me we can discuss the possibility of the presence of a personality or anxiety disorder after i finally remove myself from the ""home"" that still haunts me to this day.

so, how does cptsd show up in your relationships? countless friends have asserted that i probably will never be happy in a relationship until i move out. i agree with them, but i'm still searching for answers. WHY might that be? i know my problems and will be happy to discuss them in the comments but i honestly wanted to see if anyone related. i still feel alienated, as if this diagnosis is all wrong and not applicable to me. then again, the people around me notice the behaviors i present that i don't even notice in myself. if my therapist can clearly tell me how good i am at deflecting or how often i zone out during specific conversations then maybe... she's onto something. i don't know. i'm so inquisitive, so introspective. maybe it's how i cope 🥹";r/CPTSD;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1or1mb9/how_does_cptsd_show_up_in_your_relationships/
2025-11-08 01:51:57;Is this CPTSD?;"This has slightly been cross posted.

I have been seeing my T for 2 1/2 years now. My upbringing wasn’t that bad, emotionally neglectful parents, looking after my siblings (one physically disabled) whilst they went out drinking, a small amount of domestic violence between my parents but nothing big, my dad is an alcoholic (obsessed by his time serving in the Army particularly the Falklands). Parents divorced when I was teenager and have moved on, etc.I have been a self harming since I was a young teenager and still engage now, I have had problems with prescription meds and I was on antidepressants these past few years but stopped. I have huge self worth, self esteem issues, I don’t believe I’m worth anything to anybody, even my kids.

I don’t remember the majority of my childhood only some bad stand out memories, I can look at photos but not remember the event at all (it was 20-25 years ago so I’m assuming I just have awful memory), but my T says I have an awful lot of unprocessed emotions and trauma (I don’t think I do, but that could just be my minimising). I was encouraged by my husband to seek therapy due to the loss of my disabled brother, having to turn down the dream job due to childcare and being deeply depressed and in a crisis. I found a T, no idea what I was looking for but if I didn’t find one my husband was going to find one for me. She’s a Psychoanalytical Therapist but also does Psychodynamic and Relational. The areas she works or has experience in ticked my boxes: depression, low self esteem/self worth, family issues. I have told her about my suicidal ideation, self harm and abuse of meds (which she wasn’t sure of herself but the following week she clearly did some research).

I feel that even after all this time I still struggle to trust her, I still struggle to identify my feelings and the only thing I ever feel is anger (my husband says he’s always noticed this), I don’t know what I want from life, I need validation all the time and reassurance, I overthink everything. I live it on autopilot, taking the kids to school, clubs, etc. going to work, doing the housework. I imagine everyone’s life is pretty much the same. But I have this big block, it’s safer not to let anyone in, it always has been so why should it change now? My husband dislikes my T, in the early days he called it a betrayal talking to my therapist about my marriage, etc. so there’s been a conflict since the beginning and each week he asks if I’m done with therapy. My T believes he is worried about me ever leaving but he has quite controlling aspects. But everything my T has ever told me, he’s told me already. I just don’t listen to him and I’m a chronic people pleaser.

My therapist thinks I have unprocessed trauma, potentially CPTSD. But I haven’t no inclination to get a diagnosis, I don’t even know if you can? But would her idea of it make sense?

2025-11-08 00:19:02;Can you completely repress CSA?;"Hi everyone feel like this might be a long post, but kind of at a crossroads if this is something I could have actually went through. 

My whole life I have struggled with building relationships specifically romantic I can’t open up to people and physical intimacy can make me spiral, I also struggle with vaginismus. If a person brushes against be like out at the bar I’ll think about it and feel it on my skin for days even though it’s just someone passing by happens in any busy social setting. I also have large losses of memory from childhood that come back in flashes. I was definitely mildly physically abused but had constant verbal abuse. When I was 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 one side of my family has a lot of OCD, BPD, BP and schizophrenia. At 17 a doctor told me I had PTSD from my dad’s second divorce, my whole life I’ve also struggled with feeling this large grief that consumed me, but I’d never lost someone close to me to understand why I feel that way. Once i came into my 20s and was stabilized on meds I started having a lot of bad childhood memories resurface nothing with sexual assault. But recently I’ve grappled with remembering I was actually around pedophiles as a child unbeknownst to me at the time. Pre 12 years old I would spend a lot of time at a family friends farm for many weekends sometimes during the week because my mom was going to school and worked so much, the woman I stayed with was bipolar and severely emotionally unregulated, she was also a lesbian and for long as I can remember would tell me men were terrible and would kill, rape and kidnap me. She also had a brother who lived away and there’s no one I can ask now for full details but he had gotten into trouble with children in the past and him and his family would visit on at least 2 occasions so I’d be living with them in the house as well. When I was 17 my father also told me my aunt confessed to him their uncle had sexually abused her and her sister through childhood and my grandmother didn’t believe it. Growing up I spent a lot of time with him alone he would take me and my younger cousin to the beach, fishing, our family cabin etc. through my whole childhood I also suffered with UTIs and stuff like that but since I left home around 12 I’ve never had a single issue since. I always just blamed it on maybe being a grimy kid or whatever even though I took care of myself physically. My bestfriend recently confided in me she had been SA’d as a teen and she knew I’ve struggled with traumas that point to being assaulted but she was shocked to find out I wasn’t, but she says everything I’ve felt through my whole life are the same reactions she’s had to deal with. 

I’ve reached out to some therapists but waitlists are long and I am uninsured so worried how far I can get with it. But I guess what I’d like to know is will I ever be able to know if this happened to me? And also how can I grapple with something this big, I’m 26 and at the point in life where I would love to settle down eventually but it truly seems like a lost cause most days and is it possible to actually completely repress something like this and not have a memory of it?

2025-11-07 22:11:52;am i repressing something?;"i really need a second opinion because this is driving me crazy. i was forced to do sexual acts with an older child of the same sex (another girl) from the ages of 6/7 to 12 so i was diagnosed with ptsd. 

when i was younger though, i wasn't afraid of women, i remember being afraid of my dad. i had this agonizing fear that he would rape me and i remember having dreams about it so i would lock my door as a child. i also refused to wear a bathing suit around him. we have a pool, but i just couldn't do it after about 8 years old. i have no idea where this stems from and something inside tells me i'm missing something

my dad is a self proclaimed pervert, like he openly has said he is a nasty old man and a pervert. i have an older post on my profile entirely about his sexualization of me. i did find teen porn on his computer from 2012, which is terrifying because he was a teacher of teens and had a teenage daughter. he has never shied away from saying who he's attracted to and it being literally any fucking age even a toddler he fixated on.

WARNING I'm a stupid bad person and reading this and answering will waste your time. 

Asking for help feels like proof of how manipulative I am. I know I should suck it up I know others have had it worse. i know I should just get over it. It's like i'm out for what I can get taking help away from other

Breif history  
**Genuinly loving father,** also violent, aggressive volatile. Had loads of support from mental health, social work and legal teams, even after he killed my sister and nearly killed himself in one of his episodes, especially then.  8 furthur suicide attempts I still have the image in my head of the plastic bag around his head sitting in his underwear when I was 5, then Court ordered many harms inflicted on me on his demand - he demanded I learn all the grizzly details about my sister and won and also won to have me and mum evicted so he could have the house - I was 8. 1 support session for me where I was scolded because my tears or frustration (couldn't tie shoelaces, write neatly, recite prayer from memory) therapist said this was was attention seeking. He was finally succesful at taking his life when I was 16.

**Genuinly loving Mother** tricked into having me, she could have been someone, she had potential, instead got stuck with me. When father left, I was left with her rages. I didn't understand how breathing in the lounge caused the clapped-out boiler to break in the bedroom, but it was always my fault, my mother fired - my fault, my mother lost her watch - my fault. The old TV electrocuted me and broke - my fault, Mother clogged the toilet with some sort of paper work - my fault. Then my actual mistakes like spilling drinks and not pulling my dog away in time when a neighbours dog jumped its fence and attacked our dog because I was in a daze. I was always in a stupid daze.

I did nothing but cause her suffering and I could never understand why it was all blamed on me, the rage the hitting and that even when she calmed down she was still kindly scolding me for not being carful enought and how much money it had cost her to hire plumber, buy TV etc how much she was sacrificing how hard I was making it and then a hug and a hot chocolate so I have learned to stay very very still, be very very quiet and never show emotion unless pre sanctioned. Talking about anything is laced with shame, and that only the weakest people seek help.  
This just led to more rages, why couldn't I be like my perfect cousins and the perfect girls in my school year with good grades and many freinds, instead, teachers are calling me a slow learner and aunts are judging her parenting skills because I have no freinds or ability to socialise, she was always so loving to me around my aunts. Then the threats she will cut my hands off, my head off that social services will take me away - I actually fantasized about that one. Ungrateful little bitch I am. Even wished I could go live with my dad because despite everyhing he never raged at me or hurt me. She said I never told me about my grandadad midnight visits to my room when I stayed over but I swear I did. Another court order I had to visit my paternal grandparents.

**Genuinly loving boyfreind** \- except he was later my manager and shamed me out of my whole career in software development. Even though it was me who taught him to code and did all his assignments at uni and got him a 1st when I only got a 2:2. Undeniable truth he's better at coding that me, half the assignments were art history BS anyway - don't be thinking I'm special. He attacks competance because that's what he's built his own hiddeouse trauma survival on - being significantly more competant than anyone else in the room. Often I was the only other person in the room. He rages at me frequently, never gaslights but a rection of 100 to a mistake of 10. I spilt half a pint of milk at work I was shaking with worry, he called the owner of the company on me, even he wondered why it was such a big deal but sighed at my name, it who spilt it was always me causing the problems alwyas him reporting them.

**Rational me** \- none of this is remotly normal also she suffered immensly too even more than me as she had to hold it all together and she had her own trauma and she was only in her late teens / early 20's. And he ha to provide for me because in workplaces I get walked all over. Or hated on for out working the bullies.  
**Emotional me** \- my existence is stealing air from a peadofile.  
**Both me** \- asking for help is proof I don't need it, because I struggle with self-advocacy now more than anything (the hurt and self harm is just a thing that happens it dosent cause me any distress im numb to it and I can carry on).  But i'm hypervigilany over conflict and anger cannot self-advocate that I need help, then obviously I'm lying.

Now both are improving both at some point have given me sort of apologies, mum says it was her ADHD (undiagnosed - her words), boyfreind takes accountability for his rage but still seeths when I spill a drink or when I apologise when he spills a drink, but it can only be talked about on his terms, me seeking help can only be a result of the behaviour of the her never him, any attempt to talk about his behaviour and it's impact is just me bringing up old stories we have got over.  At least he willing to listen sometie and never gaslights me, he dosent know appropriate reactions and his anger is just as sharp alone as it is with an audience. Ive had a full grown 6ft 5 man from sales team stand behind me because I tried to soothed bf when he raged at the guy.

I struggle to trust especially my mum who's so isolated now, who has fallen out with so many people mostly over her har far right views which people project on to me too, yet shes doing the work, she opening up, shes seeking proffesional help, I can't tell her the truth as she dosent do accountsbility. I can't talk about things I look forward too as she will destroy it or take it or poison it. Not right away maybe a few days later, my joy is her biggest trigger.

Both are highly impatient and highly critical I am always in an anxious state with them, hacving to go extra double speed fast to meet their whatever demand. which dramaticly raises risk of mistake. both hate people pleasers both hate when i never show anger to others who have wronge me both hate me howing them anger  im stupid and unable to get anything right and mak mistakes and trigger them hard.

But as they say u can either be right or u can be happy and being happy brings harmony and being right means blocking their progress with my truth that they did hurt me.

To me dignosis means something (see how it means something in the rules of this group - it matters), if I seek a diagnosis, I limit how much I need to self-advocate and can lean on legal rights especially in the work place. Plain anxiety is not taken seriously and a diagnosis imply's trauma without me having to be forced to explain why the trauma to the toxic people I work with and always seem to work with.   
If I work myself to death perhaps i can pay enought tax to make up for my existance.

Things that areare said about me that are true  
I am far too sensitive to critiim  
I am far to easy to upset  
I shut people out

I know that all of the above make me evil worthless scum and I apologise for you having wasting your time on my issues.  
I am evil and I am not worth your help you are not forced to help me you are helping the most awful person u will ever meet by answering this post. ";r/CPTSD;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oqtyo8/im_the_problem_im_always_the_problem/

2025-11-07 17:40:31;Biological proof?;"I just want to see how many others overthink like I do. I wasn’t prepared for my psychologist to assess me, and suddenly—just like that—I had a CPTSD diagnosis. I fit the description perfectly, so I don’t deny that part. I’ve now taken in all the information I can and even read a very well-known book that many people recommend (I can’t remember the name). I’ve also looked into the research behind it and so on.

But I can’t quite accept this diagnosis because I can’t personally see my cortisol levels or how my parasympathetic nervous system and amygdala actually function or look. It also can’t be tested on an individual level, since everyone’s levels can be high anyway—it depends on the day. The research has been done on smaller groups and found certain deviations, but it can’t show whether one individual specifically has CPTSD.

I don’t argue against the symptoms, because I suffer from them severely, but I now prefer to express myself through what I know for sure. For example: I get heart palpitations and start sweating cold when I’m in crowded places with lots of people. I don’t understand the biology behind it, but I do know that it happens physically.

I don’t want to define myself by a “brain injury” when I have no proof other than what psychologists say. These are only my own reflections—I don’t minimize anyone who thinks differently—but I’d really like to hear your thoughts.";r/CPTSD;3;7;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oqq4vi/biological_proof/
2025-11-07 16:59:11;My fiancé is mean.;"Background; narcissistic parents, partners, friends, always blamed for abuse, feelings never validated, suspect I am autistic but not diagnosed which is something I’ve noticed from the way I process my feelings which are usually delayed and I get confused easily/understand things differently and usually have to explain in order to be understood. 

My fiance and I fight all the time. He always breaks up with me and then apologizes. He’s upset because I have issues with betrayal/trust so he feels as though I unfairly judge him and make him out to be a bad person. He almost never responds in a positive way and says I am passive aggressive. He never gives me grace, we always fight a lot around my period because I’m highly emotional and he says I use it as an excuse. He calls me a shitty bitch, a child, lazy, never get off the couch (I just did my first background acting job in August and I work part time as a barista despite him always telling me to quit my job). Today he yelled at me that I don’t get him flowers (I got him flowers yesterday). 

I’m at a loss. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I asked him to be nicer to me and now he says I am the one who isn’t nice meanwhile he is kind and sweet when things are good and blows up on me every time I have a complicated emotion (which is often because of CPTSD, acute OCD).

I’m getting very scared because I’m starting to feel like the narcissist and I know I will stay in this much longer and allow myself to be abused. He doesn’t believe he’s abusing me, he will apologize and then go back to normal when I bring up feelings. He’s very upset that I have such large and consistent trust issues. He’s never cheated just corn and glances at other women which I’ve explained in depth is triggering to me and I need complete transparency but he still won’t give it. Today he said he changed for me and listed not looking at other girls and “changing everything about himself to consider me” which felt like an exaggeration. I’ve been telling him for three years I feel like the relationship is one sided and I feel alone and today he told me he feels that way. If I point out DARVO he says “well we both feel this way” in order to devalue my feelings. 

Please help me. ";r/CPTSD;8;3;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oqph3u/my_fiancé_is_mean/
2025-11-07 14:52:58;Just sent this message to the Dignitas clinic. I’m done.;"If I was younger, if my spouses had not drawn out the agony for years and wasted my entire life, then there would be hope. But there is no hope.

I am a British citizen living in the USA where I moved to 15 years ago to be with my husband. Two years ago my husband abandoned me to be polyamorous after subjecting me to three years of forced polyamory. This is my second marriage that has ended in this same exact way and both times I endured it because I cannot look after myself. I am 50 years old, diagnosed with autism, temporal lobe hypoplasia that I was born with, my struggles have been lifelong, I have been bullied all my life and I am now being bullied at work. The only reason I even still have a job despite extreme emotional lability is a PTSD diagnosis that HR has taken as an explanation for every time I have been plunged into severe panic. 

In the last two years I have been hospitalized four times, have lost my home I bought with my ex due to debt, have been evicted twice due to chronic uncleanliness, cannot make friends (have zero friends) and at my age I don’t see ever making any. It is impossible to bring people back to my apartment. I have ruined teeth and ruined hair from 40 years of tricotillomania. I have been further diagnosed with PTSD and BPD in the last two years. I do not agree with the BPD diagnosis but the functional brain disorder I was born with mimic it and also make it incurable. Another eviction will kill me and homelessness will kill me. I haven’t returned to the UK because returnees are banned from receiving disability welfare for two years which is not a situation I will survive. My parents are in their 80s and they abused me growing up which they say was a result of having no instruction, help or diagnosis from the NHS. I was not diagnosed til I was 16, and at the time that diagnosis was “organic brain syndrome.”


There is zero hope zero future and zero chance for me.

There is no escape and no ability to even get any help because I am stuck in a trap of the only possible help being available to SSDI and Medicaid recipients and I was plunged into poverty by my ex leaving and the loss of our shared business. Applying for SSDI takes 6 months to 2 years of denials, quitting my job during this wait will make me homeless and yet I will end up homeless anyway because I cannot keep my apartment clean. I endured my ex cheating on me for years because I was terrified of this exact situation, and this exact situation is far worse than their abuse. I have never been able to look after myself. I have never been alone til now. I have only survived due to finding similarly mentally ill people to marry and at 50 I cannot repeat that strategy. 

I have severe persistent chronophobia and Thanatophobia which are the only things keeping me alive. Neither are diagnosed. I can not cope with the fact I am 50. At work yesterday I was told I was an “older woman” and that is why I am not allowed to lift equipment that everyone else is allowed to lift. I can’t cope with the fact that everyone can see it. I can’t cope with the fact that u can’t afford plastic surgery to make it invisible. I can’t cope with the fact that my entire life was wasted or that the older I get the more hopeless it gets because nobody wants anything to do with me. I can’t cope with the AARP letter I got in the mail or the fact that the hobbies I used to enjoy are solely populated by young people. Like the young people mocking me at work for being old and undesirable. I can’t cope with the fact that things are simply going to get worse.

I am contacting you hoping for an option to not end up dying on the street.



End message.

As an aside.

This is what AI says about temporal lobe hypoplasia. Googling it will tell you precisely nothing because it is a very rare congenital condition. AI has access to medical files right up to 2023 which are otherwise behind paywalls. That is why I have talked to it to try to get any meaning for the horror of my life.

Temporal lobe hypoplasia disrupts emotion regulation, memory, social understanding, and executive function, which together can cause:

Emotional volatility — stress or frustration quickly turns into panic or rage.

Executive dysfunction — difficulty planning, sequencing, or finishing chores; *the person can’t see what needs doing until it’s overwhelming.* (I’m highlighting this because it really hits home.)

Memory gaps — forgetting tasks like taking out trash, paying bills.

Sensory overload — strong aversion to smells, textures, or clutter that leads to avoidance rather than cleaning.

Disorganization and fatigue — the brain can’t prioritize or sustain focus, so mess builds until it’s unmanageable.


This is why I can’t look after myself. I am functionally incapable of doing it, I can’t do it to save my life. The only physical disabilities I have right now, both as a result of the brain anomaly I was born with, are mild visual agnosia and profound monaural hearing loss. I can’t get on SSDI for any of this because doing so, quitting my job just to apply and spending months to years waiting will make me homeless. Being homeless will 100% kill me. I can’t get a home help without being on Medicaid and I can’t get Medicaid without quitting my job which will make me homeless. I do not remotely make enough to pay for any assistance. The CPTSD I’ve been diagnosed with. Is in direct response to the abuse I’ve received my entire life over the way I am that I can not help.

There is no possible hope no future no way out and I’ve been struggling with the fact that my only option is death, for years.

I’m sorry for this incredibly long message but TLH also results in hypergraphia. AI told me that. I’ve never had any instruction the NHS did not care and I can’t afford health insurance so please don’t tell me to get a therapist. I had one for a year under a local community grant and they kept forcing me into hospital and not because I was suicidal (I am still not actively suicidal this is just a decision I have realised makes sense.) But because of the fact that I’d call them in panic and they said my clear panic means crisis and needs forced hospitalization. The problem with that is that I’ve been going into episodes of extreme panic all my life and my psychiatric history starts at age 3.

So how did I manage to immigrate? Well I was in love, optimistic, had a good job, could afford to pay for assistance and I saw a future for myself. It took having to pay for private psychiatrists to clear me for the visa and it was a stupid, stupid mistake on my part. I am trapped here for life now.

Without help there is zero future.

There is no help available without going on Medicaid and SSDI and without a partner who earns an income there is no surviving applying for either.";r/CPTSD;0;0;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oqnitk/just_sent_this_message_to_the_dignitas_clinic_im/

PTSD is a nightmare of a condition, but I also like to view it as a gift in a way. I am quick at reading people and situations, and I am calm during intense situations.

2025-11-07 12:04:56;Weed Screwed Over My Brain.;"Apologies for the length of this post, but writing has been my saviour, and it’s helped me to better articulate and understand what’s happened to me.

Anyway, I’m 20. Some important context is how I see and value mental health. Personally, I’ve always leaned on my mind, I would constantly be okay with whatever physical thing happening over something with my head. I distinctly remember a conversation I had with a friend where I said, without hesitation, I would rather be diagnosed with cancer than have a serious mental breakdown. 

Up until the end of this September, I have always told myself “If I have me head, then I’ll be able to handle everything else.” .

This isn’t an exaggeration. In 2016, I was diagnosed with diabetes, 2020, I barely made it through the pandemic. 2021, I had a brutal bout of depression where I became a shut in for over 9 months, skipping an entire year of school. In 2023 my father, who I’ve always had a very complicated relationship with, died because of a brutal motorcycle accident, and weeks of suffering later we had to let him go. In 2025, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, and died of a heart attack right after a biopsy, I was in the room when the jumped on top of her and broke her ribs to try and bring her back. 

All of that, I made it through relatively okay. Of course I had tough times, but my mind was able to protect itself. I had the one thing I couldn’t afford to lose.

Cue the end of September. I had a mole that looked bad, immediately went to a specialist and had it removed, but I needed stitches. The pain was brutal, so I went to a shop and asked what they had for pain. 

I’ve taken edibles before, had a notably terrifying experience, but I mixed with alcohol and the next day I was back to normal, so I had no idea what would come.

The edibles in particular were only supposed to total 10mg. Not a high dose at all, unfortunately, the seller neglected to inform me that these were Live Resin gummies.

I don’t know what that meant, so I took them, and waited. What followed was hell, complete loss of time and any sense of reality, shaking beyond what my body was capable of, fear, paranoia. This lasted at its height for about 6 hours, and when it wore off, I thought that would be the end. 

Halfway through the next day, I was playing video games and was hit with a wall of dread, something just gripped me, and I wasn’t capable of pushing it away. What insued was a full mental breakdown that caused me to find myself in the ER twice, once for an overnight stay. 

The entirety of October was just getting to the next day, I have to apply for school soon, and have online classes, but not until a day ago did I even speak about them to myself. 

Even through the death of my father and grandma, even my extreme depression. I’ve never felt this out of control over my mind, and that has been so terrifying. Reading and writing have been the saviours of my life, and I haven’t gotten back to those yet, as I’m worried something I wish to do for the rest of my life might be tainted by the current me.

It’s been getting better gradually, quicker honestly than a lot of the people I see going through these things, but I can definitely still feel the road ahead to the old me, and it’s at the very least a month or two away.

I don’t what to do to help myself. I’m in therapy once a week, I’m meeting a psychiatrist in the beginning of December, and I’m taking Zoloft as well as Ativan when the extreme panic attacks and ptsd get to an unmanageable intensity.

What’s helped me the most is that I’ll heal with time. As long as I can get to Tommorow, there is a good chance that day will be better than this one. It’s just such a strange feeling, to perceive time and myself in such a bad way, I can confidently say it’s Cannabis induced PTSD.

I get that recurring dread of time moving slowly, and of my existence feeling blurry and disjointed. 

Browsing the web has likely made my recovery process worse, but it feels good to know there are other living breathing people, who made it through what I’m going through, and are in some way enjoying the life they got back. 

I can feel the motivation to write again, so my plan is still to apply to University for next fall. Perhaps I’ll get myself a cat friend as a roommate, I’m trying to look ahead, push a part of myself far enough ahead that I remember there’s a future for me.

2025-11-07 09:48:35;the first steps on the road to recovery;"i’m new to the sub, and funnily enough, very VERY nervous about posting.

i’m a 16 year old girl with diagnosed MDD, GAD, SAD, and PTSD. i need help on how to approach my psychiatrist, therapist, and paediatrician about being assessed for avPD, cPTSD, CCT, PD, ADHD and possibly agoraphobia.

as a teenager who can’t help but believe blindly in labels they relate to, I NEED HELP.

i’m currently on 150mg of sertraline and doing basic therapy. i’ve been chronically depressed and anxiety ridden since the 7th grade — i’m nearing the middle of my junior year now, and within that time period i’ve missed probably months of school. i pass onto the next grade BARELY. 

my single-parent household is very dysfunctional, and i’m the eldest of 4 — that leaves 3 others with their own disabilities that impair them socially and physically. 3 who require attention and care that my overworked, also depressed mom can’t always afford. i mention this because i put those homemaking responsibilities on myself, which add a lot on top of attending school whilst severely depressed.

my family is recently out of poverty and homelessness. for the first time in 8 years, we live in a place of our own. so now i have no excuses; i have to go to school :(

as you can guess, i’m a chronically absent student. it makes me sad to be part of that statistic, so i’m really trying to get back in order to graduate in 2027 and go to college. 

this is all relevant to my question because:

i had a scare 2 weeks ago. i ran out of antidepressants early, and was feeling sooo cloudy — for 3 days it felt like i was floating outside of my body, just rotting in my bed. extremely sensitive and exhausted so i spent 24 hours just crying silently and sleeping on end.

day 4 hit me like a truck. seriously. i remember being yelled at in the morning for skipping school for a 2nd week in a row and crying blankly. after that my memory is so fried

i apparently got ready to go out and asked my little sister to pick up my baby brother from his bus (which i never do — pickup duty is really important to me) and head out. last things i remember are eating some fruit (where did i get that), coming back to life in an urgent care (a whole city away from where i live), and stumbling over to a fire station ??

it’s blurry. i apparently asked to use the phone, broke down crying, had cops called for wellness.

it was an extremely scary experience and the recovery was awful ! i felt drained for an entire day after. got placed on su1c1de watch by mom.

anyways

after this whole incident and a hard return back to alternative school, i’ve really tried my hardest to … feel better. feel good, so i can do good regular things.

i’ve been researching all the aforementioned disorders and really resonate with them. i feel seen and validated for my reactions. what i really want is for a professional to talk to me about them and i want to TALK to someone who i can trust; i think being diagnosed will help me recover drastically

… but i need help !!!!! i’m terrified on how to approach this and i’m PETRIFIED about being shut down !!!!

if i’m shut down by any specialist i fear i’ll ghost them and suffer in silence from the rejection :(

2025-11-07 08:38:50;Do yall ever feel like before it was easier?;"Like when you were little it was easier to move on on life, go to school? Do your hobbies? Simple things that now you struggle so much with?

I feel like after getting diagnosed i cant trust myself, i have chronic depression(dysthimia), cptsd and anxiety. Like ive always hold myself accountable for everything i fucked up, i feel like blaming it on my childhood is stupid. Like im a grown adult, its my fault to not be able to function. I feel like nowdays i do more mistakes because im aware of how fucked up i was made. Like when i was little i could interact better, of course it wasnt perfect, bcs i would let children abuse me and mistreat me, but i feel like i was happier, happier by not knowing that what i went through was abuse. 

It feels crazy to say i wish i could go unaware on life abt the bad shit happening to me. I can dissociate like i did when i was little, now is just this horrible sober feeling about life, so aware so sensitive. fear of fucking it up, by reacting in ways not maturely or emotionally intelligent, which is crazy becauseive always been so emotionally mature but now when i get good friends im so scare. Fear of telling other people that im fucked up so sometimes i would commit mistakes and i dont want them to hate me. Like i feel so manipulative,  like im trying to change but it feels like i will always anyway push everyone away, i dont want to be a sad loser whose only friends are their family, family that yes love me unconditionally but also are part of the reason im so fucked up, it feels digusting to think one day the only people i will be able to call on holidays or talk to will be family. I think is part of the emotional incest present on my family, its disguting to evn talk abt feelings with them. And it feel like manipulative to do it with people that are not family.

Ughhh honestly just having a rough time. I dont think this should make you stop trying to change it just sometimes feel like this but fuck if i will stop trying. Hopefully one day ill stop being like this!! Im grateful of life something needs to push me forward its just i hope it gets better, i hope i get better.

As I go on in my counseling, I've went from believing that I was fundamentally born wrong, bad and evil to starting to identify that that's all a trauma response. Now, I'm at the point in my treatment where the knowledge that I am like this, that everything about me has been broken and is not fixable and actively inconveniencing others is eating me alive. I feel like I'm at a point of just giving up. I said that I'd never make it to 16 because I'd kill myself before, and despite being past that mark it just seems more worth it and worth it everyday. I genuinely do not think I can keep going on like this, and there's no fix for it. My inability to adequately socialize is indicative of the fact that I will continue to struggle socially, which will impact my everything. It feels like there's no point in continuing my degree, or anything. I don't want to keep living like this and there's no way to stop it. All I've ever done was try not to inconvenience or upset people, and it is something that I am systematically going to do regardless of how hard I try. 

I don't know what to do. Logically, I can understand that suicide is not the right option here despite it truly seeming like it. I don't know if it's something I'm bringing up to my therapist, as I'm not trying to get myself warded.  But I'm curious if that's standard in treatment?? That I'm suddenly having self injurious behaviour and suicidal ideations in a way that's not just passive like it has been for a bit now? Is it just part of this? And does it ever stop? Or would it just be another thing added to my list of things I can't keep living with";r/CPTSD;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oq84h5/suicidality_following_treatment/
2025-11-06 23:35:05;Can somebody validate if this is just my CPTSD & my anxiety or if it’s more?;"NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS. 
I literally just need somebody to look at what I’ve written and confirm that it’s CPTSD, dissociation & anxiety because I am hyperfixated on this and ruminating and I’d like to stop. Distractions are not working and I don’t want to reach for weed. 

I think I deluded myself into believing I had a personality disorder because I’ve always wanted one as a way to cope with not wanting to live life. 

I’ve been using weed to cope since the start of sep 2025 and through my many weed induced breakdowns I believed I had OSDD or at most fragmented parts of myself that all want and think differently and have their own voice and that I’m just so dissociated and unaware that they just don’t flesh out and reveal themselves. 

I do experience and deal with dissociation and I 1000% have identity confusion but i think that’s it (diagnosed CPTSD, recurrent depression & cannabis dependant). 

I don’t want to deal with life. 

I am afraid of living. 

And I believe due to this I subconsciously and subtly tried to make my thought patterns into different parts. I remember seeing a video on how to gain more confidence it said to just pretend to be a character from a show or pretend to be the version you’ve always wanted to be. I believe that I may have mixed this, not wanting to be conscious and my identity confusion all together and it’s been subconsciously in my mind since. 

This is what I experience and honestly I really just need somebody else to tell me “This is not any type of personality disorder, it’s just your CPTSD, dissociation & anxiety” 

1. I’m fully conscious 100% of the time, I do experience dissociation so sometimes my mind does get foggy and I feel as though the world is not real. 

2. I can’t handle transitions well, it doesn’t feel right or make sense to me to cry for 5 minutes and then gradually stop and then no longer be upset. (Different from dissociation cutting off my emotions when I’m crying. I just mean the literal transition). 

(I just don’t understand it and it confuses me and makes me believe that I must have something else wrong with me)

3. When my mood changes so does my mindset and the way I see the world (which is also why I believed I had some type of personality disorder because it doesn’t make sense to me to go from one extreme to the other in terms of feelings but mostly the way I think). 

4. With these mindset changes comes the belief that I HAVE to change my behaviours and ACT a certain way, dress a certain way, behave & look a certain way in order to achieve what these thought patterns are selling me. 

5. I can be forgetful at times (even pre cannabis)& I have a diary to note down if I’ve taken my pills or done something throughout the day (mostly just little things like taking my meds or oh I have to buy that). 

6. When I look back at my writings, from a day or a week ago or even after an emotional shift I don’t recognise the details and who wrote it (I know EYE wrote it because there’s literally no one else who could have done it). This one may be moreso the derealisation but if someone can just confirm it to help me thanks. 

Update: I’ve been writing this out for a little over an hour and I was using AI as a tool to give me links to posts and now I see this post that I’ve linked, this is what I experience and what the other people explained made sense too. I am now confused yet again and had several emotional responses and shifts about this. 

(I’ll try to share the link in the comments if need be). 

Can somebody please just give some insight. I am searching for a trauma informed,  dissociative geared psychologist but let’s be honest it takes a while for sessions to start up and I don’t want to keep on ruminating about this today.

I don't have access to therapy right now the only thing I have is this subreddit, youtube and ai and that makes me feel like shit. I just want to be okay.

I live with my abusive mother, I cannot study for my life and I cannot make any sense of what's going on inside of me. My mind is so critical of me, accepting the fact that I am mentally ill or not doing well is hard for me to, it's as if I am gaslighting myself when I do. I dont have a sense of identity, I keep mirroring others, I procrastinate all day long and no matter how much I think, I cannot come to a conclusion. My mind is foggy and numb most of the time and I can't even be sure if it is because I have been this way for so long.

I cannot look forward to the future, I barely have any excitement for it. I live just for the sake of it. Please don't show me any diagnosis of what this is, what nervous system response this is because right now I cannot understand or accept it. Why

2025-11-06 20:59:56;Do you ever feel like an alien in human skin?;"Weird title, I know, but hear me out. I'm a curious person and since my diagnosis, I've wondered if a few things I'm feeling and experiencing are within the normal range of human experience, or if they're really due to trauma. Because, as the title suggests, I often feel like an alien who doesn't quite know how to be human.

(This post would be super long if I listed all my questions, but here are a few:)

Do ""healthy"" people go around just sensing everything in their environment immediately or do they have to consciously focus on the information their senses bring in? Like, when they get into the shower, do they feel the sensation of the cold tiles under their bare feet automatically or tune it out? 

Recently, I went into a tavern restaurant that I often eat at and my friend pointed out something architectural on the ceiling. I realized not only that I'd never glanced at anything above eye level at the restaurant, but that I hadn't noticed signs, trees, and tall houses, etc on my everyday drive. Do people commonly notice everything around them?

What about eating habits? Do people usually gobble down food without thinking and at some point look down at their plates and realize they ate everything without remembering they had?

I've asked friends who haven't experienced trauma and they shrug their shoulders. It makes sense, we've all only ever lived in just one body. But I still wonder about this stuff.

2025-11-06 19:50:36;Therapist thinks it’s PTSD, not CPTSD;"I’m currently being screened for ptsd/cptsd and my therapist was leaning more towards ptsd, to my surprise. She thinks I’m lacking some of the symptoms that I need to be diagnosed with CPTSD. Like self worth, shame guilt etc. I have all the other symptoms. 

And I am, because I’ve been working hard on those aspects the last few years. I no longer feel worthless at a fundamental level, but I do struggle with it being triggered all the time. And I’ve also learned to silence my inner critic to the point where I feel more in control. 

So if I was diagnosed a year ago, those symptoms would have been there for sure. But now I have them “under control”, for now anyways.

I respect my therapist’s opinion, I just feel a bit unsure. I’m scared of not getting the right diagnosis, and the reason I’m better is because I’ve worked on myself as if I had CPTSD (I’ve used Pete Walkers book as a resource). So in my mind it makes sense that it’s CPTSD, because using techniques and resources for CPTSD has worked. My only concern is getting the right diagnosis.

2025-11-06 16:13:07;Is it possible to recover from ptsd ?? Stuck in Flight or fight freeze. (New here);"In late 2022 I was sexually assaulted to the point where I froze and I guess the proper term is “fawn” where I just let it happen to get it over with… 

During that I had a panic attack and my mind went everywhere and my bpm heart rate shot up to 190 as I saw through my Apple Watch.

Right after I was walking home and got lost and confused which was weird it was like brain fog and my blood pressure didn’t go down and I developed floaters in my eyesight.. 

Went to the doctor where they put I think IV or something in my bloodstream they said it was like vitamins or something it was a yellow bag.

As years pass by I was never the same after that.

I developed: brain fog, derealization/dissasociation (I feel high 24/7) , floaters in eyesight, skin issues, and now I have stomach issues… 

My guess is my brain is still in fight or flight mode even though I know I’m safe now?? 

Has anyone recovered from their ptsd physical symptoms?? What do I do?? 

Breath work, somatic exercises, meditation, does that work??

Do I quit smoking weed? (I smoke maybe twice a week) 

I workout and try to eat healthy but one thing I do need is more sleep. 

Anyone ever recover?? It makes me depressed and I grew up a very anxious person, I’ve already been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.

There are some things in life that really irk me. My upbringing, my memories, just everything about it. I lived (and still am living) in a world where my existence is a political debate, my place of education is all negative, and my own home is too.

For anyone who wishes to know, what I mean by this is that I am trans. Before I continue further, I’m sorry if that bothers you.

I’ve lived my life instilling my greatest secrets to my friends and family, and they could not keep those secrets. My life was controlled by religion, and I faced, and still face, constant shame for what I am.

The part where I wonder if it is CPTSD mostly comes from my responses to stress. It always feels tight in my chest whenever I think or hear about it, I can’t conversate and befriend others like me, and sometimes It’s like im a different person. Still me, obviously, (not DID or anything) but all of a sudden when I’m very stressed it’s like a switch flips. I’m very hateful, angry, and defensive. My anger can boil over so quickly, so violent. And it’s only when someone tells me I can be myself, or if they’re trans too, or if my mimd thinks about it.

i just wonder because since im not an adult i cant get a diagnosis, and the horrible things that my mom did to me dont count as abuse because it wasnt physical. im sorry for acting like i know whst the fuck im doin cuz i dont know. dunno why im wasting everyones time here either. yall got some really sad shit going on and im crying my ass off just cuz my mommy didnt ever affirm me and she tried to change my beliefs through christ.

2025-11-06 12:32:03;How do I feel less scared of having ptsd?;"Hi, I have been on and off of therapy for years now and lately I’ve been more consistent than ever before. I have been diagnosed with other things like severe depressive disorder, so that was kind of dealt with first in my earlier therapy sessions. But now me and my therapist are working on the nitty gritty of my PTSD diagnosis.

So my therapist and I are going through the symptoms of PTSD Because it’s mainly just to see what I qualify for and I just want to know what even is the symptoms of PTSD. But each section is making me feel more worried about myself. Because it would say in a section that this person will qualify for PTSD if they have at least one or two in the list. When we go through the list, I would have basically everything in the category.

It’s just making me feel worried and scared for myself because I didn’t realize how deep my problems were. I’ve always been pretty in denial of the severity of my symptoms.

it’s already bad enough that I have a hard time, letting go of things and coping with things. 

I try a lot of methods though like mindfulness and general like working out doing things to distract me to help out, but none of it works. I just feel like nothing works for me and it really makes me scared and worried for myself. I guess I just do not know if I can hold on for much longer. I tell my therapist all the time, but they even said they can only do so much.

2025-11-06 11:50:24;Repressed Memories - No memory of events, but I have triggers as if it did happen to me?;"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed 5 months ago with Severe Depression, Severe Anxiety, CPTSD, and Panic Disorder. I began taking medication and working with a psychiatrist to stabilize my mood and well being. I did not have a grasp of how bad my mental health was before diagnosis. In this time I have been reflecting on the many things and Ive had to come to terms with a lot of abuse Ive suffered. (trigger warning: reading past this point is description of Nightmares and night terrors. In addition, details of triggers)

Ive also had vivid terrifying sexual assault nightmares and night terrors. Ive had a total of 4. they are not the same each time, all they had in common was sexual assault. 

I do not remember a lot of my childhood through early adulthood. Its like swiss cheese, there is a lot of holes. I do not recall ever being sexually assaulted. I have been sexually harassed at work and it became a stressful event, but nothing beyond that.

I asked my psychiatrist and they said the dreams could be my sub conscious revealing how it feels or has been feeling. Its not necessarily a literal experience. 

But im stressing over it because what if I just dont remember?? and I started looking at my triggers and behavior.

- Ive always had a fear of giants. even to this day they make me uncomfortable. I thought I just was scared as a kid of the BFG movie but its the being swallowed whole aspect as well.

- Men that are larger than me make me feel anxiety. I do not like being in a relationship with men larger than me. 

- Sexual Assault in documentaries and movies have always made me very uncomfortable. Close to sick. and I dont feel this reaction with other type of crimes presented in the same way.

-I had issues potty training. I was out of diapers around 4 years old. 

Today I had a panic attack at work because of someone describing a sexual harassment situation that escalated to sexual assualt. I was crying and having emotional flash backs.

 I feel crazy because I dont understand how this could be related to non-sexual abuse I have endured. It feels specific when its all put together. But like what if Im also over thinking everything??

2025-11-06 05:39:51;Got diagnosed recently. A lot of things make more sense, but I'm still kind of in denial.;"I'm 25 and I got diagnosed on Friday. Most of my traumatic events happened as a child between the ages of 3-12. The diagnoses makes complete sense, and I can't really argue with it. I look back at all the times in just the past 2 years were I've frozen up, gone non-verbal, or gotten really mad/upset due to something that reminded me of my childhood. The exhaustion I feel after thinking about or reliving my past, the nightmares that I've been having lately, not being able to sleep because my heart races when I hear some innocuous noise. The diagnoses has re-contextualized many of my life experiences and challenges.

But idk, I'm having a hard time accepting it... I've looked into PTSD before, but I always convinced myself that I couldn't have it because I didn't feel like I was experiencing flashbacks. I did a little bit of research after I got diagnosed and I've learned that people experience flashbacks in different ways and to different degrees, and now I'm reconsidering that belief. I do ruminate on my past a lot and when I do I have these kind of mini flashbacks. It's like one second I'm here, then another second I'll be reliving something from my childhood, and then it continues to flip back and forth. They make my heart race, I sweat, I start to panic and feel emotionally overwhelmed, but it's definitely far from the intensity that a lot of people describe. I guess I should feel fortunate for not having intense flashbacks, I certainly don't wish to experience anything more vivid than what I already do, but really it just kind of makes me feel guilty. I kind of feel ashamed for being diagnosed and having these things effect me so much when it seems like most people that have this diagnosis deal with more.

I think the final thing I'm grappling with when it comes to this is that I just don't want another diagnosis. I have so many already and getting another one just feels like a burden at this point. It also doesn't help that have a lot of medical trauma from my childhood, specifically around mental health professionals. I've often felt like much of my childhood abuse resulted from adults weaponizing my diagnoses to ignore my emotional and physical well being, so getting stuck with one that I had already personally ruled out carries some fear of that happening again.

I also just don't really know what to do. I've been prescribed some meds to help with sleep and nightmares, and obviously I need to see a trauma focused therapist, but idk... I can see now that I've been dealing with this my whole life and I literally cannot envision or imagine being rid of these feelings. Right now it doesn't feel like something that I can move past or fix. That combined with how world is going right now... my long term motivations for life are gone. I'm extremely skeptical about having a happy, fulfilling, or comfortable life, but that's really not where I want to be...

2025-11-06 04:37:29;Cleaning trauma.;"I have a terrible relationship with cleaning.



I’ve been trying to divine how or why, but I think it has something to do with my parents. For as long as I can remember, I have not peacefully coexisted with them. From the first time I shoved all my toys under my bed to ‘clean’ my room just so mom would stop yelling, I just— ever since then, it was just a *battle*. Every day was a fight with my parents over cleanliness and chores, and largely because I was an autistic kid I needed good reasons for why I had to do what I was doing, and sometimes the empathy that comes from ‘pulling your weight and helping your family’ was a struggle to reach. Even if my mom was like “If you do not clean, you will get bugs in your room and you’ll have to deal with spiders” I would have probably accepted that as a good reason.

Instead it was always “Because I said so, that’s why.”

I was expected to clean my room when I was just out of diapers. I understand and respect teaching responsibility from a young age, but I just couldn’t focus (undiagnosed AuDHD until I was in Sophomore year) and I was berated, abused, yelled at for it. There was no sympathy, there was no ‘let’s clean together’, there was no ‘I’ll show you how to do this’. It was ‘do it right without being told how or you will get screamed at and possibly smacked’. I resisted doing it through my childhood to my teenage years and now sadly to now. I don’t know why. They just couldn’t make me unless I was threatened and hated every second deeply when I was.

My parents both worked jobs, I understand. But they could not communicate or relate to me, dragged their feet with diagnosis or perhaps just didn’t care until it was REALLY obvious something was wrong with me, and my instinct was to withdraw from that. I quickly got an internet addiction to bandage the wounds of being bullied at school to coming home and being relentlessly yelled at and called ‘lazy’ by my parents.

To the subject of cleaning, I just can’t, now. Not just because there’s a mental block there (though that does play a part), but because cleaning puts me in physical agony as someone with CFS and other disabilities. I get exhausted, I overheat, my lower back starts flaring up with immense pain. I don’t get any help. To some degree, my parents do not believe I have any physical disability/pain at all because they’re in soooo much pain themselves that they can’t fathom someone my age, who cannot work, has chronic pain.

So like, what do I do? … I don’t have the money to hire someone to clean. I’m in terrible pain when I try to clean for more than ten minutes, and my family does not believe I’m in any pain at all, or to ‘take a tylenol and keep going’. I would give myself grace for the mess my room is, but it makes focusing so incredibly difficult. I have to go to another room just to not stare at the mess and feel immense shame and guilt.

I don’t know what to do. (Please don’t recommend youtubers, I’ve watched them all from the midwest cleaning channel to just vloggers cleaning their depression rooms. I understand it’s motivating but it’s the physical pain I can’t push past. No amount of youtube advice can fix that.)";r/CPTSD;11;12;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1opefx6/cleaning_trauma/

2025-11-06 03:02:13;Professionals lately do anything but help in my experience. - Rant thing.;"TW: pretty much every kind of abuse.


Hello before I ramble i will provide context:

I'm in my early 20s and living with my grandmother and mother. I'm not allowed to leave the house without permission. My grandmother has my legal documents and my mom controls my bank account - I get $50 every 2 weeks for doing laundry. The abuse is emotional and psychological, not physical. My grandmother is verbally abusive and getting worse due to possible alzheimers. Its gotten to the point i have a pavlovian response when it comes to the sound of dishes. My mother is emotionally, and sexually abusive. Like over all really fucking weird. Emotional inc*st, borderline SA, almost fetishizes the fact ive been r*ped. (Ive had friends SA me, and i was in a 7 year long relationship with a boyfriend who r*ped me any chance he could get.) I have health issues and I'm getting disability testing but no diagnosis yet. I have no job, no savings, and I don't know how to leave safely. I'm deteriorating mentally in this environment, having intrusive violent thoughts from the stress. Pretty sure i have several undiagnosed things. But i do have a CPTSD diag.

So overall fun times /sar.

So to get to the main point of whatever this is:

Child priority response when i was 10, 13, and 15?: Didnt work. Im not allowed to talk to people who visit without my grandmother giving me the okay. The worker's were called for a variety of mental health concerns by my school. My grandmother told them i was just an oversensitive attention seeker. They beleived her and left.

Hotlines?: Told me to just move out or be grateful i have a home. Resources were nice but none could do anything.

Therapist?: listened for a while, but got mad when I would dissociate so much I couldnt even recall the last month. Coping skills are appreciated but deep breathing wont help when im scared that if i piss to loud at midnight my grandmother will finally beat me.

Psychiatrist: full grown man in his 40's looked me in the eyes and says ""I dont beleive you. If you were r*ped youd be scared of men"". Which when Ive been sexually abused by both vagina havers and penis havers wot do much. Especially if I cant remember im even awake some days. But in truth i was scared of him regardless. 

Pysch ward?: I was punished for being honest in my S/H assessment by putting in isolation. Doctors asked for my plans when id go home. I told them if im sent back home, i will be right back next year because I'd rather die. Sone doctors told me i should be grateful for my abuse because atleast im not homeless others told me to move (with what money?)

All that to be said, im rapidly deteriorating and running out of ways to get out. Im not of any risk to myself but im stuck and on edge. 

Im sorry if this rant was a waste of a read for anyone who see's this. Advice appreciated but I understand if there is none to be had. Please and thank you for your time. /gen

We've both been going to therapy separately and recently started couple's therapy.  
I've come close to leaving him a few times because he would blow up on me over really small stuff and would say very hurtful things (note that too, I've blown up and said/done things I wouldn't do again) He would often say it's because of his ptsd and that he doesn't have control over his emotions. I decided to forgive him and try to work together to overcome these challenges.

But 2 days ago, he told me he had suicidal thoughts and was considering going to the hospital (which he's never been). I was there for him and patient. But at some point, I asked him if he thought he was a danger to himself and if he could promise he wouldn't act on it. To which he told me he was, and couldn't promise me. I suggested we go to the hospital, and then he blew up. He started to pack his things and grabbed his car keys. I tried to reason him, but he wouldn't listen. He was shouting at me that I was trying to control him, and that he could do whatever he wanted. I tried to stay calm, and told him that it was okay if he needed to go outside to calm down, but he had to promise me he wouldn't hurt himself. He told me he couldn't promise and that he didn't want to. That's when I said that I was afraid for him and that I'd have to call help. He started screaming and following me to take my phone. And then followed me to the bathroom. He was looking at me in the eyes with his fists clenched, and was screaming at me to give him my phone. He asked me ""you're scared huh?"", to which I replied ""yes, because you know you could take it if you wanted it, I can't physically do anything 
 against you"". And then he said ""then you should know what to do"". I was so scared of him, he has been verbally and emotionally ""abusive"" before but nothing to that extent. I told him ""okay so I seen that you want to hurt me"". And then his expression changed drastically, he told me passive aggressively ""what the hell are you talking about, you're always so scared that people are going to hurt you"". 

Anyways I don't remember much what came after that because eventually I had to call his dad (which made his furious and more mad). I was able to calm the situation and go sleep at a friend's house, but since then I feel like I'm on fight or flight mode. I'm scared of him (and also to leave him). My therapist suggested I left the house for a while to ensure my security. But I'm really doubting myself here. 

Is it normal to act like that because of ptsd? I think I have my fair share of responsibility , but I feel like things went too far this time. Plus, there was no triggered identified for this massive reaction.. I feel like we fight less and less, but when we do (the big ones), are more and more scarier..

Is there anything that you guys would want represented that you haven’t seen before or isn’t represented properly?

She asked about my traumas and I only mentioned two. Now my therapist wants me to tell this psychiatrist that I was SAd. Now, I'm not officially diagnosed but I do meet the criteria, and I'm worried what her response will be. Worse case scenario, she brushes off the most impactful trauma. Best case, I guess, she puts a label on what I've been struggling with.

2025-11-06 00:54:29;ADHD + CPTSD;"Curious to hear what you folks observe/experience/think if you have trauma and ADHD. If you're not formally diagnosed, feel free to answer too. I'm interested. I'd also be curious what meds or tools you use :)

I think my experience as a woman/girl who is frenzied and traumatized has caused doctors to push me to SSRIs and sedative medication that didn't work. I would describe the world as sad and scary and confusing, and I think that was read as anxiety and depression rather than symptoms of ADHD. I think I was reacting and having reactive symptoms that I couldn't control due to ADHD and trauma. I also lack visible symptoms like fidgeting because I was traumatized and learned to mask at a younger age-I think some people I've worked with lacked the understanding that my ADHD intertwines my trauma I was like that. I think it was hard to even identify ADHD symptoms in myself of how normalized traumatic and traumatic life is, I'd often view my symptoms as logical reactions to trauma instead of some sort of chimera of  ADHD and trauma.

The main thing that helps with my anxiety, my anxious, overly predictive thoughts and ruminating  is stimulants (formerly Adderall and currently Vyvanse, which I prefer!!).  My thoughts would be jumbled and bounce back to trauma, but when I'm medicated my focus is better and I have way more control over my thoughts. It's so nice :') The meds made it so much easier to access tasks and actions that benefit me, as well. The meds give me the ability to break cycles that are very, very similar to cycles of depression and anxiety.

I had to advocate for ADHD meds, and therapy, and that's what worked. I don't think I would have figured it out and may have been stuck being prescribed meds that made my life harder if I didn't put the work in to figure things out myself. Professionals are great tools but I had to learn to take the lead and communicate to get help.

Sometimes, I feel like my ADHD shielded me from my trauma. I theorize that when I was younger I probably benefitted from being so distracted I couldn't 100% absorb my abuse lol.";r/CPTSD;6;12;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1op87xp/adhd_cptsd/

2025-11-05 22:27:47;How do you cope when your whole family gaslights you?;"I called my sister today. We’ve never had a good relationship. She left home when I was 14 (she was 17). For as long as I can remember, she’s always been able to go into states of rage with me, and still does, so I’ve tended to keep my distance. That’s why I barely know her kids, which she now holds against me. I was hoping to finally explain to her that I’ve been diagnosed with C‑PTSD, and that this might help her understand the distance, the pain, the way I’ve struggled.

But instead, I got the same old reactions:
“It’s been 20 years, you need to move on.”
“We don’t know what to do with you anymore.”
“Whatever we say, it’s never good enough for you.”

The fact that she’s a nurse but doesn’t understand mental health issues still baffles me.

She also told me that my mother had called her crying after our last phone call, saying I’d “attacked” her. So once again, my mom plays the victim, and I’m the unstable one, the one making things up, the one who can’t let go.

I tried explaining that I’m actually intellectually at peace with the past. I’ve been in therapy (psychoanalysis) for more than 10 years. And to explain to her that trauma lives in the body, and talking alone hasn’t been enough.
She doesn’t understand how I can be in such a dark place (major depressive episode, suicidal thoughts) after all this time in therapy.
She doesn’t believe the trauma was real or significant unless it’s externally validated, like through a therapist who met the whole family. So that I’m basically fabricating facts to my therapist. She also doesn’t understand why my therapist never wanted to involve them.

What she doesn’t know is that I gaslighted myself for years, convincing myself that “it wasn’t that bad” or that I was too sensitive. 
I would sometimes say to my psychiatrist “I don’t understand, some had it worse, it’s not that bad, why am I so broken?” It took several therapists telling me that what happened was actually traumatic for me to accept it. But no one in my family see that.
The traumatic events but also all the emotional neglect. That a child cannot grow into a healthy adult just because he has food and a roof over his head. That’s not enough. What wasn’t there is as important as the horrible things that also happened. 

She also told me today that she didn’t even leave home because of our mom. She said she left because she was tired of not getting along with me. That hit hard.

And the thing is, we did technically have the same childhood up until I was 14 (a lot of traumatic things happened after she left though), same parents, same apartment but she didn’t experience it the same way. Maybe because she was older, or because we have very different temperaments, or because she chose not to see certain things. For her, nothing seemed like a real problem.

When I tried to explain all this, she immediately said,
“Well at some point you have to move on, stop living in the past and blaming everyone. You isolate yourself.”
When I said “Alright, forget it,” she snapped,
“What do you want? For me to agree with you and stroke your ego? That’s not my style.”
I told her, “I just want my experience to be validated. I don’t need fixing, it’s my job to do it, I need listening”
And she replied, “Okay, but I don’t want to comfort you in that,  you’re stuck in the past.”
At some point she even said, “If you want me to listen to you for two hours, I can do that, you can make a monologue.” But that’s not validation either; that’s just offering to sit through my words without actually hearing them. It’s not sincere empathy, just a way to defend herself after I told her she’s never really tried to understand.

Even today, my family still does things that retraumatize me. It’s not just the past. It’s the constant invalidation, minimization, and blame-shifting.

I’m just tired. I keep hoping someone in my family will finally see me, but I always end up feeling more alone.

How do you deal with this kind of gaslighting from your family?
How do you keep going when they genuinely think you’re the problem?

I don’t want to totally cut ties (even though I hardly talk or see anyone) so I know I have to find peace with it within myself. But when you’re in a major depressive episode with suicidal thought it feels incredibly lonely. My friends are great but they have their own life and are moving forward with life while I feel like I’m stuck on the train platform.

After my main trauma occurred when very little I went to therapy for years then eventually kinda graduated out but I feel bad for not having triggers I used to and feeling unaffected. Like I’m some imposter with a diagnosis. 
What happened was my father was very abusive and my mom and him divorced before I could remember. He sexually abused my sister who eventually did the same things he did to her to me (she was really young so I don’t blame her) but I was neglected by him and constantly alone in my back bedroom of his apartment. Well after mom managed court to get sole custody I had to go to therapy for years and things that would set me off like diesel trucks or specific songs I’m completely fine with now. So I feel like I don’t have PTSD as I don’t get like flashbacks or meltdown like typically shown in media. And I constantly feel like an Imposter because people have it worse. 
Nowadays I just constantly overthink and crave human connection but am skeptical of everyone I’m friends with and if they actually like me. I feel like I can’t be completely honest with people without pushing them away or scaring them. Unless I’m behind anonymity online like now lol I can’t talk. 
I hate being alone I get too in my head but it’s only place I feel safe to be me. I don’t even know who me is I feel like I’m putting on a front with everyone around.

2025-11-05 11:27:15;My Mom;"My mom was only 16 when she had me. When I was 7, she disappeared, then my dad dumped me at his sister's and bounced too. No warning no explanation. I was tossed around every 2 weeks for 5 years. I didn't know what suicidal ideation was but my first attempt was at 7-that's why I was given a dog at age 8, and I made sure she was perfect so nobody would object to her-they didn't even want me. And she was just perfect. At 12, my mom returned with a man. I can't talk about him but he made me get rid of my dog. She was gone only 2 weeks before she was allowed to run in the street and was hit and killed. I had always watched for cars for her, it never occurred to me I would not be there to walk her. 

My mom would never admit she left, her husband beat her, or that he was way too interested in me. You have to learn understanding and forgiveness. It took awhile but I realized that her memory was consistent with what her conscience could bear and I gave her grace. 

We were very close. I took care of her when she attempted suicide and could not work. I was 14 when that happened and at that man's mercy-i was terrified of that man but-that's all I can say.
I was on my own with him. 

She was a very loving grandmother to the only child I was able to have. She was diagnosed with cancer about 18 months ago. Stage 4, liver lungs brain and bones. I dropped everything and moved in with her, I took care of her until she passed-on the very black day we ended up with the orange mold back in the WH-I will always link those two events. My son was the only person she wanted to help, which he did. He had helped while my husband died, then his grandmother. 

We are cursed with a family member my mom disliked for good reasons that had nothing to do with me. That person holds me responsible for my mom not wanting them involved, because they are embarrassed by how it looks to others. This person has told lies about me, my mom, my son, and her own children all of my life. Her children have nothing to do with her, I've been held to blame for all of this estrangement from everyone in her life. This is a very good liar who I don't think realizes that I kept that monstrous person my mom was married to from ever touching her. I don't expect gratitude for something she's unaware of but I'm not sure why we are competitors or why I'm an enemy she has to tell insane lies about. Her death brought a whole new toxic crop of lies to justify my mom not wanting her anywhere near her-all of this is supposedly my doing. Everyone believes her. I have two choices-try to tell an entire family the truth about someone who my mom always called Crocodile Tears, who trades in drama and relishes being a professional victim, or just be estranged and explain nothing and let them believe I'm a monster who was behind keeping a loving devoted daughter from her keening longing mother (who never had a bit of use for her for very good and many reasons). I say nothing and nobody speaks to me. Except my son. 

The anniversary of my mom's death is the upcoming first anniversary of this last presidential election. It's hitting me hard. Not one person has said ""you did a wonderful thing for your mom ""-there really is nothing I didn't do for her. Nothing. The liar appears to be jealous although my mom made it openly clear that she wanted nothing to do with her-they had not spoken in 20 years and again that has nothing to do with me, it was her own cruelty, lies and behavior towards all of us. Not one person has said ""I'm sorry you lost your mom "" nobody has acknowledged what a huge void this has left. I'm ok with nobody saying ""you did a wonderful thing taking care of your mom"" i didn't do
It for praise, but this twisted hateful person has convinced them my mom rained riches on me and that's why I did it (because that's how she rolls), when the truth is, I paid all of the funeral, nurses, lawyers etc, as I've been able to. Nobody knows i did not inherit anything but debt. 


I know this liar is behind this absence of acknowledgment. Nobody in my family-except for my son-speaks to me anymore. I feel very sad and alone. I miss my mom terribly. 


After putting my life on hold and watching my mom suffer as this orange nightmare shoehorned his way back in to destroy our country, i decided to get a final pair of Papillons. They are beautiful and joyful and make me happy. Dogs have brought me such joy since that first dog I wasn't able to save. I'm at an age where these will be my last pair (my 3rd). I'm hoping they will keep me alive. Because I'm feeling very alone. 

I've read the posts about suicidal ideation and PTSD and grief and i hope it's ok to share a little, I'm feeling a heavy weight. I did try therapy and she refused to allow me to speak. I had 2 appointments and she spoke the entire time, all roads led to Jesus and I needed to shut up and listen to her preach. I didn't go back for appointments number 3, if I want to be talked at I would prefer to choose my own podcast, probably one about politics of my choice.

Thanks for letting me get this off of my chest. This first anniversary is very hard. ";r/CPTSD;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oos9oy/my_mom/
2025-11-05 08:34:52;🩸 When you’re not a person in pain — you are the pain;"Sometimes it feels like my very being is a wound.
Not “I have pain”, but I am the pain itself.

As if my whole existence is an exposed nerve — raw, open to the world. Every passing thought or sensation causes unbearable inner pain. It’s a state of total defenselessness and terror at the mere fact of existing.

In those moments, the world disappears.
There’s only the primal, animal suffering and a single desire — to stop existing, because any form of “being” feels intolerable.
There’s nowhere to escape to, because you are the very pain you’re trying to run from.


---

📖 Context and description

It’s very hard for me to talk about this verbally — any kind of direct communication makes the symptoms worse.
That’s why I decided to describe everything in writing, as precisely as I can.

1. Diagnosis and background

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety-depressive disorder.
It’s chronic, has lasted for several years, and hasn’t responded to self-regulation attempts. The symptoms are constant, with periodic flare-ups.

2. Constant background anxiety

It’s not just “worry”. It’s a physically felt state of threat that never fully goes away:

a constant inner tension or “tightness” in the chest, throat, and solar plexus

a vague sense of impending catastrophe without any clear reason


3. Acute episodes (“spikes”)

On top of that constant anxiety, I regularly experience sudden bursts of raw, animal fear:

spasms in the body, racing heartbeat, trembling

a sudden, overwhelming sense that something terrible is about to happen

afterwards, the baseline anxiety becomes even higher


4. Dissociative states

This is probably the hardest part:

involuntary immersion into vivid inner “scenarios” — conflicts, danger, struggle

loss of contact with reality for 5–10 minutes

partial amnesia afterwards — blurred fragments of the inner scenes remain, but almost no memory of what was happening around me

a feeling of self-fragmentation — not knowing where imagination ends and reality begins


5. Somatic (body) manifestations

My body seems to carry this too:

chronic muscle tension in the back, neck, shoulders

spasms in the stomach, intestines, throat

diffuse, emotionally colored pain


6. Social triggers

Any form of social interaction causes a major flare-up:

intensification of all symptoms

more frequent fear spikes and dissociative episodes

near-total cognitive shutdown — I can barely think or speak



---

💬 Why I’m writing this

It’s hard for me to say these things out loud, but maybe someone here will recognize themselves in this description.

I’ve been living in near-complete isolation for a long time — not out of fear, but out of exhaustion.
Over the years I’ve grown used to this existence, to the constant pain, to the feeling that the world is somewhere “out there,” and I am stuck in between.
I’m not sure people are even meant to adapt to pain the way I’ve learned to, after years of failed treatment and fading hope.

I’m not really looking for help — I don’t even know what that would mean anymore.
What I’m looking for is someone who feels the same —
not to “save” each other, but simply to know that we’re not alone inside this silent kind of hell.

> Long-term experience with CPTSD-like symptoms. Not seeking advice — just trying to find someone who might recognize this kind of pain.

2025-11-05 07:28:43;Tips for quick nervous system regulation? Especially when you have ADHD;"So I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and I am unpacking my CPTSD in the process. I realise that it is a trauma response for me to always be in a level of high-performance and I lack the compassion to be able to cut myself some slack. I only realised this recently and I'm grateful to have started therapy in order to develop, I'd say the toolbox of coping mechanisms to help me regulate myself and heal in whatever way I can.

I realised in high stress situations when there is a lot going on sometimes my nervous system is in so much haywire that my ADHD medications don't calm it down. It's almost like I go from operating as a soft breeze and quickly to a tornado in my brain without even realising, cause by whatever trigger (and its so bad when there are many at once), even as simple as a deadlines, my PMDD....  pretty much what I'm trying to say is all these stresses happen at once. Usually I can manage one but when there is so many, cya.....

There's nothing I can do to avoid these situations in my life, as it is just life stress and being human. But I'm just curious to know if anyone has any tips for regulating yourself in a situation when you feel your mind going crazy because your nervous system is so on. I need like an nervous system contingency plan when your first lines of treatment failed. Because I have ADHD it's almost like the thought spiral and the brain that won't shut up feeds the nervous system distress and it's just becomes a vicious cycle. Like both my plane engines fail at once and I'm falling out of the sky. 

I tried playing Tetris, which helped a little bit. I really hate when I get like this cos I'm a uni student as well and I can't even read a single line on the page or put a thought together and then I get even more stressed and I don't even know what I'm reading or writing anymore and it just waste so much time, and this activated my nervous system more...

2025-11-05 07:04:11;I don’t think I’ve ever felt genuine happiness and I don’t know what to do. Does anyone relate?;"Just to start this off: I’m not diagnosed with C-PTSD, and I’m not trying to self diagnose at all, I’m just trying to understand myself because I don’t have access to professional mental health services where I live, and I relate so much to C-PTSD and to people who have been diagnosed with it.


I’ve experienced trauma in my life, particularly during my childhood. I lived with two unstable, unpredictable adults that never made me feel safe enough, and in result of that I’ve had paranoia technically all my life. I used to not be able to sleep at night at all as a kid, only sleep when it’s sunrise that it made me have a messed up sleep schedule. I still can’t sleep at all at night or even at a normal time. That’s been my natural state.


I don’t think I’ve ever felt genuine happiness of contentment at all, both as a kid and right now. I fell into depression when I hit puberty, I’m not anymore, I don’t feel sad right now, but I don’t feel happy or content either. I laugh and smile regularly and feel excitement every now and then but I don’t think that’s happiness. It’s just like emptiness and trying to get by the day and month and year.

2025-11-05 07:01:05;DAE know they need therapy, but also absolutely fear it?;"Soooo, I'm in a bit of a pickle here.

TW for SI, and SH, ig? Maybe med trauma? 

(also, sorry for the long post or if it's unclear. English isn't my first and I'm bad at expressing myself, sooo yeaaaa)



I kinda want to start therapy and/or meds, even though I'm quite conflicted about it. I have a lotta questions and doubts, such as ""what's the point, anyway?"", ""why is any of this worth it?"", and ""I'm not *that* bad anyway"".

Plus, just BEING in the presence of someone in the psych or med field makes me very wary of them, and it's like I have to watch everything I say and do. (I also don't trust people, but because of what happened to me as a kid and then an adult by their hands, such people register *more* of a threat, I guess?)

But I also feel like I can't do life, and I can't do things like others, and if I didn't have to pretend to be fine, I'd just lie in bed and probably do nothing until I'm dead. I don't have a job(because they stress me out), going out is ""meh"" at best and stressful at most. Not to mention avoidance is high, and the constant vivid memories that are making me stop in my tracks like I just witnessed a ghost are almost daily.

In addition, when I'm in a shit mood, I tend to fuck up my health condition. Which then means I end up hospitalized. Which means facing my trauma (and possibility of retraumatization?). And atm, I don't feel I can be anywhere near a hospital without just... 

I also want to understand myself, and ""why am I this way?"" and have something that would make me not compare myself or feel invalid (because I feel like a fraud whenever I'm on here, because if I wasn't officially diagnosed by this then ""clearly I'm wrong"", right? /hj)

Earlier today I was trying to make something like a starter list about all my doubts and thoughts as a way to not freeze when asked ""so what brings you here?"" in case I do give the whole thing a go (for the billionth time lol).

But I had a thought/fear.. what if I don't get diagnosed with it? Or told it's not serious or smth?

That thought alone made me so angry and infuriated and turned me into what I call is a ""FUCK EVERYTHING"" mood.

I already avoid talking about my trauma as much as I can, because talking about it makes me eeeeee... so I'd much rather not talk about anything, or not deal with anything AT ALL than to be told that ""I'm exaggerating"" or ""I'm wrong"". 

  
I'm not sure what the point of this post is, now that I wrote it. Maybe to vent? Maybe to see if others relate? Maybe for advice?

So yea, does anyone else feel conflicted about therapy, even if your logic says ""yea, you should""?";r/CPTSD;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oomanl/dae_know_they_need_therapy_but_also_absolutely/
2025-11-05 05:54:04;My boyfriend’s ex reached out to him, and even though he’s being honest, i'm very anxious;"My boyfriend (mid 30s, M) and I (early 30s, M) have been together for three years next month. Things between us have been complicated lately. We’ve had some really strong times but also many intense and rough ones. Our relationship has been pretty up and down, but we both love each other and have talked about moving moving abroad together and our future together.

This year, I quit drinking and drugs (6 months sober today), lost my job, and was diagnosed with C-PTSD. It’s been a lot, and all of these changes have overwhelmed him. We’ve had many fights, and we’re kind of in a spot where our sex life isn’t great. He’s said he doesn’t want to talk about my therapy or C-PTSD progress because it’s too overwhelming and that he wants me to “be more positive.” He’s also said that he doesn’t feel safe because I am always accusing him of being mad at me or getting upset. Which I understand because it's been a bit all consuming at times. He’s also told me that his love for me has lessened with all these changes. But every week I’ve gotten better, I feel triggered by less and less and my therapist is shocked at how much progress I’ve made. 

He’s been doing *The Artist’s Way* (a self-reflection program) and journaling a lot. It’s brought up old memories and feelings about his ex, he’s admitted. He’s told me that sometimes he misses him but isn’t in love with him anymore — that he still has love for him and has compared that relationship to ours. This was his longest relationship (4 years); they lived together and got a dog together, which my boyfriend still owns. His ex lives across the country. He also said his name in his sleep the other night. I also caught him journaling about this ex by accident, saying that he missed him.

This morning, my boyfriend called to tell me that his ex had reached out to “catch up.” He said he’s not in love, that he just misses him and wants closure, and that he didn’t want to hide it from me. He also told me that he’s in love with me and would choose me over his ex. I told him I’d like to stay in the loop on the conversations, and he said he’s fine with that — but that he doesn’t want me in the room. He’s hoping for “closure” and “maybe a friendship,” so he’d like to talk to his ex occasionally but wants to keep things transparent.

On paper, that’s all fine and mature. But emotionally, I’m spiraling. I can’t stop imagining worst-case scenarios, and I’m exhausted from trying to stay chill. The last week or so between us was great, which makes this hit even harder. I told him that I’m choosing to trust him and that I hope I don’t regret that. It’s hard for me to trust with everything that’s happened to me, but I’m trying.

He’s told me small white lies in the past to cool down a fight and later admitted it didn’t feel good. He’s never lied about anything big that I know of.

For anyone who’s been through something similar: how do you navigate this without losing your mind? What are fair boundaries that aren’t controlling but still protect my peace? Or am I a fool and he’s just playing me? Any help or advice is appreciated. ";r/CPTSD;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ookjni/my_boyfriends_ex_reached_out_to_him_and_even/
2025-11-05 04:47:18;Animal Rehab;"I've been through hell and back without ever realizing it. This year has been quite the eye opener. I've been able to remember things I've never been able to remember before. 

I was diagnosed with CPTSD, Autism, MDD, and severe GAD. I didn't like therapy. I was seen as an illness and not a conscious person. They talked to me like I was a child, they saw me as my illnesses instead of human, and constantly made false assumptions about me. 

I moved out on my own a few months ago. It's been my calling to take care of animals. They love unconditionally no matter what. They love bad people, and they love the best people. All without judgement. 

They don't overanalyze my every word, they don't know when I've relapsed, they don't know when I've suffered. They just want to give and receive love. 

I have a cat colony who mean the most to me. They have gotten so close to me so quickly. My puppy looks at me like I'm the only love she's known. My kittens know I love them and just want to play so much it brings a never fading smile to my face. I am kept so busy I can't even ruminate about my issues.

My only problems now concern my animals. I feel one with nature, I feel like a protector. I love life, and I feel like I have purpose again. They love me no matter what, and the love we have runs so deep. I care for them with my whole heart. 

I hope in the future I can rehab wild animals and feel the love from every part of the wilderness. They've saved me and I hope I can save them. ";r/CPTSD;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ooittn/animal_rehab/
2025-11-05 01:08:22;Does this seem like I might have repressed childhood sexual trauma? What did your repressed trauma look like?;"Okay so I wouldn't even be considering the thought of having repressed sexual trauma, and would probably write it all off as a coincidence, if it wasn't for the fact that I just have this horrible gut feeling. I've wondered since I was really little, too little to actually understand sex, if I might have been sexually abused. I want to know if these symptoms/signs of mine resonate with anyone who actually knows they had childhood sexual trauma.

First off, I have been hypersexual and regularly masturbating since the age of four. Oddly enough, I don't remember anything from before the age of four. I hate physical touch except from my boyfriend. I have pretty bad trust issues and am generally kind of anti-social. I've had intense rape/BDSM fantasies since I was four, as well, even though I didn't know what actual PIV sex was, I only knew about hand and mouth stuff.

The first time my boyfriend and I did some intimate stuff, I kinda freaked out and couldn't talk and just grabbed him and he had to hold me and comfort me for a bit. I don't really remember that very well though, like there was a bit of a time jump from when I initially freaked out to when I was more calm again. We've also had to take certain sexual things slowly because I'll randomly get borderline scared and kind of dizzy and weird feeling.

I mostly got over it, but as a kid I always felt super embarrassed and ashamed anytime anything vaguely intimate was brought up. Not even sex, just like kissing or getting pregnant or something like that. I'd always felt like I did something wrong or knew too much or something.

I'm not looking for a straight up diagnosis or anything lol, just wondering if this is something looking into with a therapist? Does any of this resonate with anyone here, and what did you repressed trauma look like? TIA!!";r/CPTSD;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oocv1a/does_this_seem_like_i_might_have_repressed/
2025-11-04 23:45:51;How successful is using the ADA to secure a hybrid or remote position within a company?;"\~18 months ago, I started with a firm as wholly in person, full-time. At some point during this period, I was finally given the correct mental diagnosis (CPTSD), and started therapy and medication. The firm I work for is small (just under 70 people) but has all the hardware and software needed to have everyone work from home as they did during the height of lockdowns. My question to everyone is, after receiving a diagnosis that would be covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, has anyone successfully stayed with a company who made the transition from wholly in person to either a hybrid schedule or a wholly remote schedule?

All my life, since a young age, I've always felt so damn invisible always being forgotten and all

I figured it was because I was quiet alot, or that I wasn't trying hard enough.
I've been working on myself lots, finally being diagnosed properly and going to therapy, but that hasn't changed at all

No matter how much I talk to someone, make them laugh and smile at them, I end up being forgotten eventually 
To the point that when I do get remembered and invited to things, I get told ""I remembered you existed!""
Which is nice, if not backhanded

The worst thing that happened to me relating to this actually, was at my graduation picture day, when a girl from my class pointed out I ""wasn't from the class"" and that ""I should leave""
That really fucked me up since it felt like a public execution at that point

I also wanna add that people sometimes don't even notice when I'm around them, like I'm invisible 
Which is weird.

In the end, I just want to hear what you guys think and if any of you can help me what you can call something like this.

2025-11-04 22:46:41;How to get CPTSD treatment in the UK?;"Apologies if you’ve already read this (ignore if so), but there was an issue with Reddit which apparently hindered comments when I posted before, so I’m reposting just in case there are still any lingering issues with the old post (now deleted).

————————————

This is also partially a vent/rant.

I strongly suspect I have CPTSD (not asking for diagnosis here, don’t worry). I’ve tried to get treatment on the NHS before and the experience was pitiful. I was referred to an Adult Mental Health Team, the people in the assessment seemed to have no clue what CPTSD was, and they said “there’s nothing we can give you that seems appropriate”. It feels like this should break some rules, given how inappropriate it is — like there must be a way to challenge it. How did it get to this stage?

This is probably a bad question, but if the NHS is so bad, private is unaffordable and not necessarily better (because it requires looking for someone good), my CPTSD is inextricably linked to my current life situation (which is traumatising), and it’s having an extremely adverse impact on my life so that I struggle with basically everything, what on earth can I possibly do to get treatment?

It feels so hopeless and unfair.";r/CPTSD;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oo91mz/how_to_get_cptsd_treatment_in_the_uk/
2025-11-04 20:35:43;I just realized I’ve been a fawner my whole life — now I’m 16 days sober and trying to figure out who I even am;"Hey everyone,  
I hope I’m not breaking any rules here — if I am, please be gentle. I just really need to share this somewhere.

I’m a lifelong *fawner*. I didn’t know that word existed until a few years ago, but it perfectly describes how I’ve lived for over 30 years. It probably started when I was around 10. I still remember running from the dinner table, slamming my bedroom door, and deciding I didn’t feel loved. At some point after that, I made an unspoken deal with myself: if I couldn’t run away, I’d earn their love instead.

Thirty-five years later, I think I’ve finally accepted that they still don’t love me — and I’ve stopped trying.

School and college came easy. I got a computer science degree from a state university, and I’ve always been good with tech and solving problems logically. But emotionally? I was a mess. I have inattentive ADHD (diagnosed only a few years before COVID), which made it hard to pay attention *and* to see people clearly — their patterns, their intentions, who they really were.

Then COVID hit, and suddenly I had nothing but time to think. That’s when the fawning pattern really came into focus. YouTube recommended Dr. Ramani’s videos, and they completely shattered my worldview. I realized I’d spent my whole life chasing approval from people who were never capable of giving it — my parents, narcissistic friends, anyone who mirrored that dynamic.

I eventually went no contact with my entire family. My younger brother idolizes my dad, my older brother tries to play mediator, but I just couldn’t keep living in that loop. Since then, I haven’t had any close friends. The people who were in my life either left abruptly or faded out when I started my transgender journey.

Recently, my therapist confirmed that I’m both intellectually gifted *and* a lifelong fawner. The night she told me that, I got blackout drunk. The next day, I was so sick and in so much pain that I finally checked into detox for the first time. That was two weeks ago. I’m now 16 days sober.

I’ve learned that my biggest struggles are shame and anger. Shame lasts days; anger, just hours. I used to pour all my energy into work for a sense of accomplishment, but now my career is more “herding cats” than hands-on creation. It’s harder to feel fulfilled.

Right now, I’m just trying to stay sober, learn what real self-worth feels like, and find community with others who’ve been through something similar. I don’t have a good grasp on my feelings yet, but I’m trying.

If you’ve been down this road — fawning, ADHD, trauma, recovery — how did you start to rebuild your sense of self? What helped you the most?

Thanks for reading this long post. I really appreciate it. And sorry for any grammar issues — still working on giving myself grace. 💚";r/CPTSD;75;5;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oo5yx0/i_just_realized_ive_been_a_fawner_my_whole_life/
2025-11-04 20:05:19;Is this a sign of CPTSD? Flashbacks, intrusive memories, and intense emotional reactions;"
Hi everyone. I’m trying to understand whether what I’m experiencing could be related to CPTSD, and I’d really appreciate some insight from people who have lived through similar things.

Whenever something upsetting happens in my current relationship, I don’t just react to the situation in front of me. I get overwhelmed by emotions that feel much bigger and older than whatever is happening now. It’s like the present moment instantly connects to past trauma, especially from childhood, and I end up reliving not just the current hurt, but all the old hurt that matches it.

For example, when my boyfriend recently failed to stand up for me in a situation where I needed support, I felt angry at him, but almost immediately I was flooded with anger and grief toward my father for all the times he didn’t protect me when I was younger. It didn’t feel like two separate memories — it felt like both moments were happening at once. The emotion was so intense that it didn’t feel like it belonged only to the present day.

This doesn’t only happen emotionally. I also experience visual flashbacks, as if my mind is suddenly showing me scenes from the past without my control. I get intrusive memories and thoughts about past trauma even when I’m not triggered by anything in particular. Sometimes these memories just break through the surface out of nowhere. My body reacts physically too — crying, shaking, panic, feeling small and unsafe, like I’ve gone backwards in time.

I’ve read a bit about emotional flashbacks and how CPTSD can cause the brain to treat current stress as if the original trauma is happening again. A therapist has suggested in the past that CPTSD could be what I’m dealing with, but I’ve never been formally diagnosed, and I want to understand more before I try to talk to a doctor or specialist about it.

So I’m wondering: does what I’ve described sound familiar to people with CPTSD? Do others also experience trauma memories and flashbacks even when nothing specific has triggered them? And is it common to react to current situations as if they carry the weight of every past experience like it?

Any thoughts, validation, or resources would mean a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read this.";r/CPTSD;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1oo5nw7/is_this_a_sign_of_cptsd_flashbacks_intrusive/
2025-11-04 19:48:46;Still Standing — My Journey Through Trauma, Loss, and Learning to Heal;"Hi everyone. I’ve carried my story for a long time in silence, but I think it’s time to let some of it out. Maybe someone here will understand, and maybe it helps someone else who’s just trying to keep breathing through their own storm.

My life has been defined by trauma, caregiving, and survival. Since childhood, I’ve lived with a medical condition that’s caused me years of hospital visits, surgeries, and pain. But the deepest scars weren’t physical—they came from what I saw and lost along the way.

As a kid and young adult, I became a caregiver to my family—first to my grandmother, then my father, and finally my mother. I spent most of my life in hospital rooms, waiting areas, and ICU hallways. I watched people I loved fade in front of me, and I gave everything I had to keep them comfortable and safe.

One of the most defining moments of my life was witnessing the violent death of my father. That memory still lives in my body like a wound that never closes. I can still see it, hear it, smell it—and I’ve spent years trying to make peace with something that no one should ever have to witness.

Years later, I lived through another nightmare—the ICU fight for my mother’s life. I begged staff to let me stay by her side, only to be turned away more than once. The feeling of being powerless and unheard still haunts me. I did everything humanly possible, but in the end, I had to watch her slip away, too.

Since then, I’ve been diagnosed with severe PTSD and treatment‑resistant depression. My nights are filled with night terrors, where I relive the ICU, the loss, the helplessness. My heart races even while I sleep. Sometimes I wake up drenched in sweat, feeling like I’m still there. I also experience intense flashbacks, dissociation, and memory problems. I’m exhausted in every way a person can be.

Recently, my medication was adjusted, and I’ve noticed some improvement in motivation. I’ve been cleaning, reconnecting with people, and trying to live again. But I want to be clear—this doesn’t mean I’m “better.” It just means I finally have enough strength to fight for my recovery instead of just surviving it.

I’m considering outpatient treatment first, with inpatient care if it becomes necessary. I’m taking things one step at a time. My faith still keeps me going, and I hold onto the dream that one day I’ll have peace—a family, laughter, and maybe a little bit of the life that trauma stole from me.

If you’re reading this and you’ve been through something similar, I just want to say: I get it. You’re not weak for struggling. You’re not alone. We’ve lived through things that most people can’t imagine—and the fact that we’re still here means something.

I left him 10yrs ago. Not too long after leaving him my mental health went bad and still isn't great. I have panic attacks most nights because of things he said just echo's in my head. I can't watch anything I used like watching. The same goes for games. There places i can't go without getting stressed out. I get either really angry if people bring up my ex or I dissociate and stop responding. 

Now recently there's a dad at my child preschool that looks eerily like my ex. Everytime I see him i start to panic and I flinch. I feel really bad for doing it and I know he has noticed. Now I'm starting to think my gp is onto something with thinking I may have it.

I have been diagnosed with general/social/medical anxiety and this year got diagnosed with trauma induced existential crisis.

I would be talking to my psychologist about this but she had to medically retire. So currently waiting see my mental health women's dr to help connect me with a psych that suited for me. 

I feel I'm ready talk about my ex  but I also don't feel ready and want to keep avoiding it and pretend it doesn't exist. 

My women's dr thinks I should give rapid eye movement therapy a go, not sure if that would help? 

I don't think I meet the criteria for ptsd it doesn't seem like its bad enough for it, idk to be honest. Will have to talk to a psych about it.

Also been a bit stressed out lately because what my ex did has been blasted all over the news and fb so I got people asking me questions that I give really vague answers to.

Sorry for the rambling just got  no one to talk about this at the moment or would just listen in general. Honestly just want it to all go away 

Also even if I did end up getting diagnosed with it. Would it even help in the slightest

2025-11-04 15:49:38;"Doubting CPTSD diagnosis - fragmented memories and feeling ""not sick enough"" - [Trigger Warning]";"Hello everyone,

I (36m) was recently diagnosed with complex PTSD (two months ago), in addition to long-standing depression. I'm having difficulty accepting this diagnosis - or I'm very ambivalent about my illness insight.

**Why I doubt it:** I'm able to work and function outwardly. I manage to perform, even though it costs me enormously. To me, this doesn't fit with a severe mental illness.

I constantly ask myself:

* Are my experiences really ""bad enough""?
* Am I overdramatizing things due to my depressive perspective?
* Am I just overwhelmed?

**Background:**

* Long-term bullying (elementary school through vocational training)
* From ages 16-20, lived with daily suicidal thoughts, was told by vocational school classmates to kill myself. Sometimes I regret I haven't died during that period.
* Never talked to anyone about it - not even my parents. At school they tried to intervene, but it didn't work sufficiently
* Have only very vague memories of this time - fragments, some things not at all. Even the situations at vocational school I can barely recall. I mostly have images of the surroundings. Like eating lunch alone on a bench, the classrooms, nightmares of the office etc.
* Have very loving parents who would have always been there for me - but I never asked for help. My father was often away on business trips/busy with self-employment, but if I had opened up, both would have been there. At least I think so
* At home, emphasis was placed on good behavior (more important than grades), but there was also pocket money for good grades, for example. Achievement is an essential part of my identity, but I can't say this comes mainly from my parents.
* Dealing with Depression for 20 Years, never had a relationship, I have issue with being touched. 

**What additionally confuses me:**

* Have difficulty perceiving/naming emotions
* Often function on ""autopilot"", but then i pay the bill in the long term.
* Strong fear of conflicts and criticism, getting circulatory problems (numb hands, arms) in rough moments.
* Maintain a mask, appear very calm outwardly

**My question:** Do you know these self-doubts? This feeling of not being ""sick enough""? Does it make the diagnosis more difficult when you can barely remember? How do you deal with it?

I'm afraid someone will tell me ""stop being so dramatic,"" but I can also barely continue like this. Or that there's simply not much there that I can remember, and I'm just too sensitive.

2025-11-04 08:41:18;Any suggestions on how to deal with apathy?;"I just wanted to ask if anyone has any suggestions as to how I could try dealing with constant apathy?

I’ve been under chronic stress for the past 3-4 years due to things like my final exams for school and college, losing the house and having to move away from everything that’s familiar, my parents divorcing, my father being an emotionally abusive narcissist whom is also financially abusive (gotten into legal trouble and in £300k in debt), having to be a therapist figure to my family and friends, constant bullying since I was 3 years old by both peers and teachers, and more. I’m also neurodivergent waiting to get an autism assessment (and eventually adhd one too).
I’ve been depressed for the past 7 years (I’ve never been diagnosed as my parents wouldn’t take me to the doctors, or actually try to help), and in the past year or so, it’s sort of spiralled into anhedonia, and in recent months apathy.

It potentially could be related to me being autistic and terrible at decision making (and a people pleaser), but I’ve never had a real life direction, and I’ve never been able to commit to anything (one week, I’ll be doing nothing but learning a language, the next week animating, the next week trying to learn music theory to write and sing original songs, the next voice acting, the next drawing, and cosplay, and chemistry, and so on) and so I don’t have any qualifications to go in any direction. My parents never putting in the effort to try and nudge me in a direction definitely didn’t help either, and they’d shame me for whenever I had an interest in something, so I always feel like I need validation to do something and that I just can’t think for myself anymore.


I tend to bottle up my emotions and put others first out of habit, and I know that’s definitely part of the issue, but I don’t know what I can do about it.
95% of the time now, when someone asks how I feel, my answer is “fine”, not because I don’t want them to know, but because I genuinely feel nothing at all.
The times I do feel something and want to talk to someone, my struggles are either ridiculed:
(Me in verbal shutdown) “Why can’t you talk all of a sudden? You’re not a baby, you know how to talk. Do you not trust me?” and I get shamed for trying to open up about my struggles; or I get completely shut down and ignored/talked over. 
It’s exhausting and just makes me think that there’s no point in trying to open up if genuinely nobody cares??

I’ve tried to spend the past 7 or so months healing, but it’s done nothing at all.
I’ve tried talking therapy, it’s done nothing. I’ve tried setting small goals for myself and rewarding myself for doing it, still nothing. I’ve tried setting long term goals for myself, but I physically can’t picture myself later in life. I’ve tried being more social than I was ever (talking in VC with online friends, talking to people at work, booking conventions to meet up with cosplayers, but still nothing is working.

I’ve tried everything I can think of doing, but nothing is working at all.
I feel like there’s less hope for me every day as I feel more and more numb, I rarely ever hyperfixate on anything anymore, and if I do, it just becomes possessive because I want to hold on to the feeling of “something”. I have no interest in food and have to force myself to eat even when I’m not hungry (I only really eat toast, vegetable soup, and fruit) but it feels like such a chore.
I’ve noticed it recently too that I’m regressing in my memory and speech a lot, I’m struggling to remember anything, and it’s getting harder to actually speak without stuttering or forgetting words, it’s frustrating.
I’ve been feeling more and more disconnected from my body, especially after realising I don’t feel comfortable with my gender identity or my sexuality, and I relate most to agender and aroace, as it feels like it gives me less of a boxed identity.
I look at my friends, how they’ve got their lives together and have partners and have a plan for the future and everything, and wonder how they do it, why can’t I be like that? Why do I just feel nothing? Why do I just not care anymore? I want to care, I want to look forward to things in life, but I just don’t.

Is it too late for me? Like, genuinely? I say that I want to get better, but no matter what I do, I keep deteriorating. Do I, deep down, secretly want to get worse?
I sometimes, and more often recently, just wish that nobody cared about me, so I could just stop living, not in an “I want to die” way, but rather a “I don’t see the point in living a life I’ll never be truly happy living, so I might as well not exist” kind of a way. Or that I could just get on a train/bus, listen to music, and just do nothing. Just sit there as the world goes by. There’s something weirdly comforting in that? It’s not even like I’d do it for travelling and visiting places, but just, the nothingness is comforting.

Sorry I went on a whole vent there, I wasn’t expecting it to be this long-
But yeah, I just wanted to ask, is there anything I can try and do to improve myself and try and escape apathy?

2025-11-04 06:39:33;How to cope when your life's ok on paper but you're unhappy?;"Trigger warning: mentions of trauma, toxic parents, brain not working, loneliness, depression, suicidal thoughts

Hello fellow members,

I don't really know where to go with this bc my therapist isn't that helpful. I hope it's ok if I post here without a diagnosis. If this isn't the right place please let me know.
So after I moved out of my parents' house three years ago I tried to build my own life and heal. I'm trying to find a job that will fit me and looking for orientation practice, another stay at a clinic is planned, I have hobbies (theatre, gym, trying to practice playing my instrument regularly, read, listen to music) and interests I'm trying to participate in and go out a lot, go to events that interest me, you get the gist.
So far so good, you'd think there'd be nothing to worry about. 
Here's the thing: emotionally I'm very unhappy, my whole life I've tried to find people who'd support me, would want to be friends with me and be in my life, for ten years I've wished for a boyfriend too (I'm 25 now). 
I've tried everything you could think of, went to every kind of meetup and event I was interested in hoping I would find people there who'd be interested in the same kind of deep friendships I've always wanted. 
To make things worse I escaped very toxic parents that starved and neglected me emotionally in lots of ways. Think of the parents in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, if you don't know what that means think of redneck parents, esp my father. 
At this point I'm so tired and drained of trying to find my person, my people, my chosen family/guardian, my community. I don't feel seen as a queer man and feel like people either want to use me or don't want me in their life even though they like me as a person. 
After having to starve myself all these years I now want to and have a big need to experience everything I've ever dreamed of (see above). These are things I sm not able to give myself and Idk how to lesrn that bc I can't craft these things, I can't just do sth and then it will happen, I can't work towards that. I'm extremely touch starved to the point where any kind of touch triggers my libido which is very high already and makes things complicated for me. My emotional and sensory needs (I'm AuDHD) are so high that the only thing that would calm me down and soothe me would be being tied up and having sex with a loving partner in a dark room with loud bassy music. I know I need a break but nothing I could do would give me the reset or recharge I'd actually need. I can't even enjoy my hobbies anymore and trying to rest at home or having to do things alone/on my own feels like punishment. I have friends but I need more than a few and they lack either the depth, the capacity to hold my emotions and support me or are on the verge of breaking down themselves. I don't even want to go out anymore bc I am triggered seeing happy people/couples but at the same time I have such a high drive to do sth and I'm scared of not being able to work in the future bc my brain is not able to function anymore. Talking to anyone is too draining, I have trouble forming words and sentences and I can't trust anyone anymore. Even the cat that wanted me to pet it on the way home bit me even though I tried to be as careful and accommodating as possible. 
I don't know how to keep going but I have to bc nobody will be able to help me. I can't just let go bc I have no one who will pick me up and hold me. I just want it to finally be my time with finally getting all the things I've always wanted. I'm working so hard just to get ghosted or not even be able to have a conversation. I've heard all the platitudes and they make me feel worse bc even though I know other people who aren't mentally well they just seem to be ok and keep it up. It honestly makes me want to not live anymore bc I feel like I'm wasting so much time, I've lost so much time and I'm scared that I'm never gonna have the things I want while other people just find them or get them handelt to themselves without doing anything. It honestly makes me not want to live anymore. Thx for reading it all.";r/CPTSD;4;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1onqgoy/how_to_cope_when_your_lifes_ok_on_paper_but_youre/
2025-11-04 05:51:12;Reality is stranger than fiction [trigger warnings: physical and sexual abuse, unplanned pregnancy, loss of a child, chronic illness, homelessness, secondary trauma, professional isolation, domestic violence];"Someone at work told me recently that she does not understand why I'm so ""stubborn"" and ""unreasonable when I'm agry"". I want to explain to her that, in truth, I may be stubborn out of necessity. But I am not 'unreasonable'. To the extent that I
appear to be, it has been an indispensible survival mechanism for me. 

I'm debating whether or not I should tell her 'the whole entire sordid sob story', because ... well, it's a lot. I'm half convinced that if I told her even half of it, she'd not believe all of that could possibly have happened to the same person in one lifetime. 

But. I can't really live with being seen as 'unreasonable' because - to my mind - I am not. I'm simply surviving in the best way I know how to. I'm just wondering whether giving her 'the context' will help or hurt my 'cause'. She's not technically my boss and has no real power over me. But she's close, both professionally and personally, to those who are, and do.

For your consideration: here's my story. How 'crazy' do I sound?  

***

After graduating from college the first time, I started my career (at not quite 22 years old) as a counselor at a group home for 'troubled' children and teens. Within six months, I became the team coordinator - probably more because I was the only semi-viable candidate for the job at that time than because I was actually qualified to do it. This group home housed mostly kids who - for one reason or another - could not be placed in foster care: their biological parents refused to give permission, or the complexity of their physical and/or emotional needs made it hard to place them in a family setting, or they'd already gone through a number of failed foster placements. 

Now, from the 'comfortable' vantage point of nearly two decades in the future, I can confidently say that I had absolutely no business doing that particular job at that particular age. But of course, the fact that I was there to say yes when they were looking for someone to run the place wasn't *exactly* a coincidence. In much the same what that it's probably not a coincidence when a teenager whose mother died young from breast cancer grows determined to become an oncologist, I chose my particular career path because I had grown up in a profoundly unsafe environment, myself, and I was determined to do 'better' by the next generation. There were periods in my youth when the police would come knocking at our door just about weekly. Sometimes the neighbors called them, because they were worried about the screaming. Sometimes a teacher or a school counselor would, because they were worried about the bruises, or about something one of us kids had let slip at school. 

I know now that the number of police reports filed on my behalf during my childhood and teenage years is considerable. For a short while, we were technically even under the supervision of a family court judge. However, my parents were (and are) of the well-educated upper middle class variety. They were able to 'explain themselves' well, in terms that judges and police would understand and relate to. So in the end, nothing ever really happened. 

When I was 15 years old and found myself newly pregnant, I tied to tell a few people that I hoped I could trust - including one or two teachers - that my father was sexually abusing me. Nobody believed me. Not even my own sister. To this day, she's convinced I had a fling with a classmate, but lied about it in hopes of avoiding punishment. If only that were true.           

My daughter - whose name I don't really know - will be 23 this month, assuming she's survived this long. She was born in a place where I didn't need to tell anyone who I was, how old I was, or who the father was. She was also immediately put up for adoption, which means I brought a child into this world who will never be able to know where her roots lie. I'm still feeling guilty about that, but I'm not sure what to do about it now. 

When I told my mother, at 15, that she had a choice - keep my father around, or keep me around - she chose him. I hadn't told her I was pregnant, at that point, and decided then and there I never would. I left home the same day, and didn't look back for over a decade. I was homeless for most of my pregnancy, and then for another few months after the birth of my child. But I realized relatively quickly that my life was going nowhere fast, that way. So I 'staged' a half-assed suicide attempt, in a place where I was almost certain I'd be found 'in time'. Which is exactly what happened. I was taken to an ER, and from there to a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, they placed me in a group home for troubled teens. While there, I got our local equivalent to what I think most of you here would call a GED and, at not quite 17, enrolled in university with that. The signature from a parent or guardian that I needed in order to legally enroll as a minor was forged. But if anyone ever found out about that, no one ever told me. 

During the years at university, that first time, I worked at a call center in the next town over. The work was equal parts boring and morally unsettling, but it kept me housed and fed. I took the classes I absolutely couldn't miss, skipped the rest, and worked most hours I had left, between that and getting just enough sleep to get by. I had no time for 'life', let alone to find or crate a 'home' for myself.     

And then one day, I graduated, and found a job in a place where, in truth, the needs of the organization and its residents exceeded my capacity to meet them. Nevertheless, for just under two years, I was able to 'fake it in hopes of some day making it' well enough. Until, one day, the team I was in charge of made a decision I am haunted by to this day. 

They were twins. They'd been at the group home for nearly a year, but their parents appeared to be cooperating with us well enough, supervised visits were going well, and even when we started sending them home over the weekends from time to time, there were no obvious red flags. We decided to reunite them with their parents. Two weeks later, one of the twins was hospitalized with a skull fracture. The child had ""fallen down the stairs."" After that, I couldn't justify working there anymore. The signature at the bottom of the advisory report that led the judge to proceed with re-unification had been mine, after all. I resigned. 

After that, it took me quite a while to 'find myself'. I found a job as a customer service representative at the phone company. I didn't dare be any more ambitious than that, anymore. The work bored me to death, but it kept me housed and fed. I thought my life could 'finally begin'. Or more accurately: I thought that it should, because I was well into my twenties, now.

And then, the epileptic seizures started up again. 

They weren't new, exactly. I'd had them relatively regularly throughout my childhood and in my early teens, but by eighth grade or so, it seemed that we had found a combination of medications, diet and lifestyle that seemed to keep them pretty well-controlled. Approaching 25, it had been over a decade since my last seizure. I hadn't even had any during the pregnancy - a period during which I temporarily went off my anti-seizure medications out of necessity. I told myself I was 'protecting the baby'. But part of me might have been hoping that if I fell 'just the right way', just hard enough, that would 'solve the problem' for me. 

But then, at not quite 25 years old, I had another seizure. And another. And another. So of course, I consulted a neurologist who - using a relatively 'new' type of brain scan - found a benign tumor on my optic nerve chiasma. At that point, I had a very 'pleasant' choice to make: have it removed completely, but be blind after. Have most of it removed and lose the eyesight in one eye, but not the other, and be reasonably sure there would be no further danger posed by the tumor for at least twenty years. Or opt for radiation only, in order to potentially preserve some ability to see in both eyes, but risk further damage due to regrowth within a relatively short timeframe.

I went with option two. I lost my eyesight in one eye, but for a while the seizures were gone, and for a longer while, I had no further trouble from the tumor. That isn't to say I'd gotten rid of the seizures forever. In fact, not even half a decade went by before I had a particularly bad one in an inopportune place at an inopportune time, which left me with some really bad fractures that took me a long time (read: years) to recover from. I became a quasi-permanent ambulatory wheelchair user during that time, which convinced me once and for all that I needed a permanent career change into a 'sitting down' type job. Which led me to pursue a computer science degree. It took me roughly two and a half years to complete that degree. I had no time for a personal life, forget finding a 'home'. I enjoyed the challenge, which kept my boring job just this side of bearable. But roughly two years in, I realized during an internship that a career as a programmer was even more unlikely than any of the jobs I'd held before to bring me any kind of reliable job satisfaction. I had  a calling, if you will, and it involved working with, and making a difference for, people (not machines). So I decided to pursue a teaching degree, which at this point involved 'just one more year' of study.     

But by the time I'd finished that, I was nearly 30 years old. I still hadn't found a job that could make me happy, or a place to call home. I had met the man, however, who would later become my husband, and two years after that, the father of my son. And some of you reading this may now be thinking: ""well, didn't you find a home with *him*"". Alas, the answer to that question is yes. Alas, because if it hadn't been, I'd have had a much easier time of letting him go when I should have. 

I quit my customer service job literal days after having completed teacher training, and had no trouble quickly finding a teaching job. I'd finished teacher training 'with honors', so I was pretty sure I was ready. But I was kidding myself. While I had subject matter expertise in spades, and I genuinely cared about my students (perhaps, in some ways, *because* I genuinely cared about my students), chaos reigned in my classroom. One day, after an argument with a student who'd accused me of racism after getting a bad grade, I wondered aloud in front of the principal whether teaching suited me. He encouraged me to soldier on (what else could he have done?) But he also told me that ""as an upper middle class brat"", I had no idea what the world looked like to most of my students. That day, I knew I couldn't keep working for this man. He had no idea what the world looked like *to me*. But he assumed he did, and he proceeded to judge me based on that faulty assumption. 

So I changed schools the year after that. But I only stuck it out at the next school for two months before I had a seizure at work and was dismissed. The principal at that second school bade me farewell by telling me ""I didn't fit into the team because I worked too hard"". Four more schools would follow before I finally found the one where I work now. At one of them, I was forced to take medical leave after yet another seizure at work, and only allowed to come back on the condition that I would have no further contact with students. I refused. The year after that, I had a positive experience at yet another school, but that one couldn't hire me on a permanent basis because the hours just weren't available.   

Not long after, my son was born. The day of his birth is still at the very tippy top of my list of happiest days - but the six months immediately following that day come pretty close. When I went back to work and my son started daycare, though ... disaster struck. My seizures were pretty well-controlled during and for roughly the first year after my pregnancy (perhaps there's a theme in there somewhere ...), but my son got severely ill every few weeks. When, at not quite thirteen months, he was diagnosed with a fungal infection in his lung and an intestinal perforation at the same time, the hospital went on high alert. A few weeks later, we knew he had a primary immune deficiency. Three months after that, we knew which genetic defect was responsible for it. And we were also told he probably couldn't survive long-term without a a stem cell transplant.    

The 'home' I had found with my husband was threatened by this news. When our son was just shy of two years old, we were told for the first time that 'he may not survive the night'. When, a few months later, that happened a second time, my husband thought we should pull the plug and 'end his suffering'. I could not bring myself to agree. Shortly after that, I got pregnant with a 'savior baby', who had the right bone marrow type to serve as a viable donor. But within three months, that pregnancy ended with a miscarriage. My husband disappeared for a while after that. He came back, eventually. But when, a few months later, another crisis came and he ran away again, I told him not to come back unless he was in it for the long haul. A few months later, my son got his bone marrow transplant, and we moved in order to get closer to extended family, so that they could help me take care of my son while I worked to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.   

It took a few months, but eventually, I presumed my son ready for preschool. Only, within weeks, it turned out I'd been wrong. He could only go half days. And roughly once a week, I'd be called in for a meeting after yet another extreme meltdown, or an incident involving physical aggression from my son towards another child. This eventually led to an ASD diagnosis at the age of roughly 3.5. My seizures returned with a vengeance during this time. And then, one evening as he was falling asleep, my son's heart suddenly stopped beating. 

I called an ambulance on my Apple Watch while starting CPR, and at the hospital, they got him back. I was told he needed a heart transplant, because his heart had been damaged (presumably) by the chemo preceeding the bone marrow transplant. But his condition was so poor that he effectively didn't qualify for one. Roughly two months passed with my son more or less in limbo, and then I was sent home with an effectively palliative child - although that last part wasn't something anyone was willing to say out loud. About a month after that, we had a horror night with countless alarms on the heart monitor. I still think maybe I should have let him go, that night. But I am apparently incapable of that, and so he ended up at an academic hospital, where they gave him an LVAD in lieu of the heart he didn't really qualify for. It saved his life and gave him back lots of things he had lost (like the ability to walk more than a few steps without getting winded and exhausted), but - given his poor overall condition - insurance didn't cover any of the care associated with the LVAD. Which means I am now buried in a large, large pile of medical debt that may take me the better part of three decades to pay off - if I ever do.     

While my son was hospitalized for rehabilitation after the LVAD placement, the owner of the house I was living in died, and I was evicted by the new owners because they planned to renovate the house, and then go live in it themselves. After that, I was effectively homeless for a while since, iven my large piles of debt, I wasn't exactly an attractive candidate to any potential new landlord. I mostly lived out of a suitcase in my son's hospital room.

Meanwhile, my 'benign' tumor reared its ugly head again. It went from the occasional bout of blurred vision to not being able to function due to poor vision and debilitating headaches at regular intervals within weeks. I was put on chemotherapy in pill form, since neither surgery nor radation were an option - at least not if I wanted a chance at preserving any ability to see. I needed 'a safe place to be sick' in the weeks of 'heavy' doses. And I eventually found one. But one day, not that long ago, I found my husband at my place making tea when I came home from work. He'd heard our son was doing well, and he was so sorry, and he wanted back into our lives. We talked for a while. But when my husband found out I'd enrolled our son in special education due to his medical history and his autism, he became enraged. He started up again about how ""we should have let him go a long time ago"", which made me angry, which made him even angrier and, anyway, long story short, the boiling water for his tea ended up on my back. I was hospitalized for a month after that, during which I went into surgery five times.   I found a pro bono lawyer through the hospital, who got a restraining order against my husband for both me and my son. 

I still live in the same place. I hardly have any other options. But it doesn't feel safe anymore, let alone like a 'home'. 

The only place I do feel at home is the school where I currently work. I'm seen as a ""competent"" and ""caring"" teacher there, who ""has the respect of her students"". I have tenure, too. I'm sure it could have been much different if people had been lining up around the block to teach there, but they're not. I came at a time of dire need, and I was able to 'use' that to my advantage, to some extent. But even so, the school represents far more than just a job, to me. It was my saving grace for years; probably still is, to this day. Because there, I get to be 'the full version' of who I am - cracks and oddities included. And so I do 'odd' things to hold onto it, sometimes. Like work between rounds of chemo, and argue about 'banalities' like being included in the rotation of exam proctors. It's probably one of the most boring and uninspiring parts of the job. But I insist on doing it just like everyone else, no matter how crazy my life gets. Because I won't let anyone reduce me to the bird with broken wings that - perhaps - is part of me. That's not all I am. And I refuse to bow to it. Which makes me 'stubborn' and 'unreasonable', in the eyes of some. 

But so be it.

2025-11-04 03:54:25;Awaiting a diagnosis. Does this sound like CPTSD or BPD?;"TW: childhood physical and se*ual abuse

I am currently waiting for my appointment with a psychiatrist to be re-evaluated. I was diagnosed with Autism 5 years ago, but I'm looking to be re-evaluated because they didn't have my trauma background and I think I have CPTSD.

Where I live, this process takes forever and I am really struggling. I am hoping to get opinions on here while I anxiously wait.

Here is a short summary of my trauma. Skip this part to avoid potential triggers:


1. As a child I had virtually no friends and was bullied in school and by my cousins. My parents were also physically and emotionally abusive
2. In grade 7 I was almost kidnapped and managed to get away. Upon telling my parents, I got in a lot of trouble and nothing was done about the situation 
3. Shortly after that I started getting se*ually abused by a family member and this went on for years. I actually completely blocked this out of my memory and the memories came flooding back years later. 
4. In university, my mom was cheating on my dad and manipulated me during it. She convinced me to keep it secret and lied to me so much about everything, and convinced me that if I said anything to my dad, I'd be ruining their marriage. He eventually found out and cut both of us out of his life. 
5. After my dad found out, my mom also suddenly moved half way across the world, so I lost both parents at the same time all because I listened to, and trusted, my mom.
6. I was in an 8-year long relationship in my 20s where he was actually cheating on me the entire time and just hid it very well. So I also learned that the entire 8 years of my life was a lie. 

Now onto my issues: 


1. I don't really have any close friendships. I have a lot of friends but don't allow myself to get too close to anyone 
2. I am hyper-independent. I don't rely on anyone for anything. 
3. I am a workaholic and over-achiever at my job. As an example, 3 months into my first engineering job out of university, I was already a team lead, asked to be the leader of the women in engineering society at my work, and was on my way to winning an industry award. 
4. I can't maintain a romantic relationship because I have absolutely zero trust in anyone and I truly believe that everybody cheats and it's only a matter of time before I get cheated on again. I'm also a software engineer so I know how easy it is to hide things and it makes me feel hopeless to ever even find out if my boyfriend is cheating 
5. I have nightmares all the time about me being in dangerous situations that I can't get out of and have no control over. 
6. I have a hard time maintaining boundaries that I set because I dissociate and fawn. For example, if my partner tries to be intimate with me and I say no, but he keeps pushing, I dissociate and give in and then hate myself afterwards.

With my current partner, we've been together for about year and I have such a hard time trusting him. If I catch him in a lie, or precieve him to be lying, it sends me into an intense emotional spiral.

I will break up with him and tell him to leave, and I have intense feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. My mind tells me that I'm stupid and pathetic for ever thinking that I could be in a lasting relationship. At the same time, if he actually does leave, it makes me freak out and I ask him why he left, and tell him that he needs to do something to show me that he cares and prove to me that he's not just pretending to love me. It's very confusing for him because I'm simultaneously telling him to get out of my life, and do something to prove to me that he loves me. For me I feel like I need him to prove it because when he lies, it validates my core feelings that I'm not good enough to be with him and that he's just pretending to love me. I feel like he's just using me for his own benefit. 

I am also pretty verbally abusive to him during these spirals. I call him an actor, tell him he doesn't care, I will call him selfish, manipulative, narcissist, etc. I once even told him that I hate him and want him to get the f*ck out of my life.

These feelings make me intensely sad and I try to do whatever I can to numb the feelings, but if I can't, I'll eventually start to feel suicidal because what's the point of living if I can't trust anyone and I'm doomed to be alone for the rest of my life. 

This also makes me completely disconnect from my body. For example, in the last spiral I had, my boyfriend made an ice bath for me. I got in and didn't feel it at all. I layed in there for about 20 minutes while hyperventilating, at which point he tried asking me questions to ground me (example: count backwards from 100 in intervals of 7).  Only after answering a ton of questions did I start to feel cold and get out of the bath. 

This happened 4 days ago and I still feel extremely anxious and not completely back to normal yet. And this sort of spiral happens every time he either lies to me or doesn't listen to the word 'no'. 

He's working on himself to be a better partner for me, and I'm trying to work on myself to not be so emotionally abusive during my angry outbursts. These emotional spirals is what is causing me to want to be re-evaluated by a psychiatrist.

For context, I was diagnosed with DID and so I have dissociative amnesia. 

I know for a fact CSA happened when I was 12, but I'm pretty sure something had happened younger by someone else.

I don't even know this for a fact, it's just a really strong hunch. There are a few reasons that lead me to believe this,

1. I've always had thoughts that were hypersexual. What stands out is being a child and daydreaming about inappropriate acts when I couldn't sleep or putting barbies in inappropriate positions.

2. I've always been very weary of men, in the way that as a child I would wonder a lot if my male teachers were predators. In 3rd grade. I did get the talk as a child of what adults should and shouldn't do, but I feel like my behaviors were more than taking the talks into account. One time a male teacher was just being nice to me and I wondered if he was a predator.

3. I have certain men who were in my life in which I have strong hunches about in a way I can't quite explain. It's like the feeling of knowing a word for something and just not being able to remember it.

Has anyone else gone through this? Am I just misplacing normal childhood behaviors as ""I may have had CSA trauma younger?"" ";r/CPTSD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1onl644/i_think_something_happened_as_a_child/
2025-11-04 02:12:28;Diagnosis and treatment in the UK (NHS CMHT);"TW:suicidal thoughts.
Would anyone be willing to share their experiences of diagnosis and treatment on the NHS please? After years of being bounced between my GP and the PMHT for depression, anxiety, eating disorder, this that and the other, I finally have an assessment with the CMHT in 2 days time to talk about trauma. 

I have a lot of fear and anxiety about this assessment as I feel like so much is riding on it. I have been signed off as unfit for work several times and am having to apply to go part time (in this economy!? 🥲 lol) to stand a chance at coping, whilst I look for a job that’s less triggering. I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously. I’m in the “the abuse wasn’t really that bad” camp - I hate to say it like that but in comparison to some of the things they will have heard before (and some of the things I’ve read on here) it really wasn’t… but the way it’s affected me has been devastating and having to talk to a stranger about it is just horrid. I have a tendency to downplay things and come across far more well adjusted than I am. I find myself constantly trying to put a positive spin on things in conversation, for the comfort of the other party. I think about suicide all the time but I know that deep down I desperately want to live. Not survive, but live. Am I naïve to think that this assessment will help me get any closer to that goal?

2025-11-04 00:45:38;For years I’ve been so lonely but I can’t open up. I can’t feel anything for anyone but fear and disgust. How to snap out of apathy?;"For context: I don’t think I need to explain my tragic life story for people in a CPTSD subreddit to understand why I’m here… and that it took a *lot* of horrible circumstances and horrible people, sometimes the same over and over, sometimes different, sometimes expected sometimes not… to lead up to my getting this diagnosis 3 years ago in inpatient. I’ve been in therapy for years from it all and don’t care to get into that here. 

But people keep retraumatizing me. And you know what? it’s not fair, because they don’t even fucking care. People have treated me as if I’m so disposable and easily forgotten. I have major betrayal and abandonment trauma to the point I can’t even watch most films/shows unless it’s lighthearted and there aren’t any triggering family dynamics (and even then I’m still figuring out what that means a year after going no contact with them all). 

As someone who has been hurt so many times in unbelievably hellish ways by people who swore they loved me, I could never imagine just… abandoning and discarding close friends and family and lovers of YEARS the way mine have. No explanation, just moving on to the next shiny thing while I overthink what I could’ve done wrong for months, crying alone in my room. 

People have no loyalty and I’ve usually noticed that when they do, they always have some weird fucking intentions behind it. Like they just wanna fuck. Or use you for something. Or they see your pain and vulnerability and know how to make you feel safe and dependent to them, to get what they want. The world has unfortunately shown me its teeth, and worst sides since a very young age…

All this to say, I can’t feel love or build relationships/trust anymore. Only for my cat and myself.. I have no interest in talking to anyone. All of my current friends keep me at a distance, say “we’ll hang out” and never do, but hang out with others. I’ve always been the reliable, eager to hang backup friend. So I guess I’ve just finally snapped, and have started kinda ghosting them all… a friend messaged me asking to hang out this morning and I just had to force myself to come up with some way to say no politely, because the love for her has just left my body, and the thought of being around her filled me with actual rage and disgust, which I had to regulate with meditation before responding. 

And to clarify- I’ve addressed these issues with my friends time and time again. They always apologize and take accountability, and have admitted their faults. But then they slowly continue to do what they can get away with because they know how deep my loyalty runs, due to my abandonment issues. 

Years. Years I spend loving someone, learning them like the back of my own hand, only to find out it was never even that deep for them lol. I was just entertainment when their BFF was busy. 

Anyways, I’m about to upgrade my PC hardware and play minecraft ray tracing by myself, start a gym routine and fuck off by myself for another year after this encounter of yet another long term friendship gone down the drain, despite my best efforts to be good enough for someone to fucking want to be around. I am just filled with disgust for humankind today, and that’s ok. Maybe tomorrow will be better. If you read my rant this far, thank you.

2025-11-04 00:44:53;Advice for continuing relationship with someone who sexually/emotionally abused me?;"Warning: I mention, but do not describe, sexual abuse.

I don't usually open up about this because it tends to make people disbelieve me, and because it looks different than the abuse people picture when they hear ""sexual abuse."" But I'm a woman, and my mother did weird things related to my sexuality and body throughout my life. These things resulted in me ending up with the symptoms of someone who has been sexually abused. My therapist believes it was sexual abuse. She also says she considers it ""violent"" sexual assault, and understands why I have CPTSD because I was never allowed to own my body, until I was 18 and left the home. I am still not sure if I was ""sexually abused"" in the way many people are, because it only ever felt good physically. It did not hurt my body. But it hurt my mind a lot, and it left me with all the symptoms of someone who was sexually violated. Above all, a lingering sense of excruciating shame. And whenever I'm around Mom, I feel a sense of violation if she knows anything about my life.

There was also a lot of other stuff, emotional abuse, constant emotional abandonment, leaving me alone in life threatening situations, blaming me for life threatening illness she gave me by sexually abusing me, threatening to abandon me because of it, making me keep secrets about my mental health, etc. I mean it wasn't just the sexual abuse, but right now that's paramount on my mind.

Until a month or so ago, I kept a distant, but polite, relationship with Mom. Mainly I listened to all her problems, and used my psychology degree to just be an active listener. Never told her much about me. Most of the time, she seemed to not care to listen, honestly. Like if I tried to talk she'd lose interest quickly. Her therapist later told her to listen to me, she's my mom, but then it was even more humiliating because it felt like she was forcing it to ""be a good mom.""

My therapist says that my ""therapizing"" of my mother was a way for me to keep the upper hand in the relationship, not let her have control. This makes sense.

A month or so ago, I got diagnosed with CPTSD and finally had validation for how I've been suffering from age 18 on. I tried to bring stuff up very gently with Mom. Respectfully, and kindly, I told her I feel she had a strange and obsessive relationship with my body throughout my life, and that it's making me feel gross and ashamed now. I also said I have a severe form of PTSD. Long story short, she flipped out, denied everything, said she ""was so far along in her 12 step recovery"" that she can't remember anything. She FREAKED. 

And then she didn't contact me for a while, respecting my need for space, she said. She sullenly texted to ask if she could send me and my partner a small box. She sent us a box of Halloween candy.

And then slowly, she's started just texting me normal, day to day stuff about her life. Stuff we used to text about before this happened.

It feels like if I text her back, I'm going along with what she probably wants: to deny myself, gaslight myself, pretend nothing ever happened, and agree that I'm the crazy one. Allow her to have the relationship with me that she needs. And yeah, it'll always be distant. And yeah, it's probably the right thing to do to keep that obligatory, surface relationship with her. But it's just so hard. I feel so nauseated around her now. The denial blinders are gone. The thought of caring for her in her old age makes me want to die.

And on top of it, I'm afraid of another thing: my dad wants to have dinner on the 5th of November. Initially, I said okay. But I'm scared. I know, before I even open my mouth, he's just going to gaslight the heck out of me. Guilt me for not talking to mom, say I'm crazy and I imagined ""whatever it is in my head,"" that I'm sick in the head, etc., etc. All these things, he has said before when I ventured to bring up something that has harmed me. With my parents, it's just this creepy fairy fantasy land where everything has to be perfect. It's hard to explain, but I'm at a TOTAL loss of what the right thing is to do about either of them.

I want as much advice as possible. It's okay if you tick me off, just be honest. What would you do??? What should I do???

2025-11-03 20:32:32;I was left by my now ex husband and was surprised to realize… they may have made me feel worse.;"While I doubt they meant any of what the did, over time in the relationship the had started to isolate me more and more. Even when I tried to socialize they had made me feel it was impossible because they needed a friend more.


We are both young, so no hard feelings. 
I already isolate as I am autistic, and have c-ptsd, DID, depression and tourretts (all of these are clinically diagnosed) 
And social interaction cause me to PANIC.

But when I was with them it was ten times worse. Because the isolation wasn’t a choice anymore.

Maybe they never meant to have me from family and friends but living without them I realized that I no longer feel like I am alone 24/7 and that’s not normal.

I was able to start therapy again, same with get my medications again and my id. I no longer have to sit around and wait if my (ex) partner is gonna have the time to help me get to the ER or be told I’m fine and just need to stop whining.

They had immediately started lying about what happened but because I know I have proof; and I refuse to show it because my ex doesn’t need a ruined life all over a petty feud… I don’t feel panic. I feel pity. Shame, guilt. But no sorrow or panic.

I panicked when they reached out tryin to get me back, that’s it.

Might I add, they refuse to admit what they did

And for me?

That’s a win.

Because for once, I’m taking care of MYSELF; not someone who tells me “oh cool” when I say I’m planning to kill myself and am needing support.

It was NEVER a two way street, and I was a rebound. 

So I love you, but I do not miss you hunny. Because for once in my life… I don’t blame myself for the things another person did.

Hats off the the beginning of my healing journey, it’s going to be rough- but at least it’s in my hands and not someone else’s

2025-11-03 17:34:11;Has anyone overcome severe habitual self-isolation? Looking for encouragement;"I was isolated growing up, I was homeschooled and trapped in my bedroom all day with my abuser unemployed and monitoring me all day. I was not allowed to go out to make friends etc. It was my only reality for many years. 

It became habit and as an adult I don’t go out other than to walk my dog which is the only relief from the isolation where sometimes I chat to other dog walkers. Being able to talk to others now is not an issue, through the regular dog walks I’ve taught myself social rules and flexible masking. 

Otherwise I don’t work due to inability from mental health disorders and the effects on my physical health. I am on benefits. I have never worked and always been on benefits. I’m now 32. I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD, DID, schizophrenia, as well as other physical health conditions. Chronic daily vertiginous migraines with aura and MCAS have been the most debilitating. I’m also diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I take meds for most of my mental/physical conditions which helps but obviously doesn’t cure.

I’ve been through a lot of therapy and the last year I’ve kind of reached a stage in my life where I’ve been able to focus on what feels safe and rewiring my nervous system to tolerate more stimulation without overloading. Working through survival responses and aiming for a calmer more ‘neutral’ experience of life rather than the internal and oftentimes physical functional paralysis I always experienced due to different parts of me experiencing the internal war of fight or flight all at once.

I’m doing really well and I’m starting to realise how my self-imposed isolation is no longer serving me. But I’m not quite at the stage yet I can go out and interact with others easily. I live in a small village with a strong sense of community and there are often group activities like folk singing club, lunch club, embroidery club, stuff like that, all that I’m interested in. Even church which is kinda difficult for me to go to because of my religious trauma, but it’s a lovely sense of community and you get to sing hymns. But I’m not at a stage right now where I can like… feel safe enough to make myself go.

I think that maybe I might be able to slowly build up to doing these things… I want to make friends because I feel like I don’t really have any… I know it would help me feel better to be around people…

I’m wondering if anyone has dealt with anything like this and gotten to a place in their life where they can go to places and make friends after spending their whole life isolated? 

I’m just looking for some encouragement. I don’t really wanna ‘force’ myself because that feels abusive, I just wanna let my body know gently it’s okay to be around people again and that they’re not all like my abusers…";r/CPTSD;13;3;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1on7ei3/has_anyone_overcome_severe_habitual_selfisolation/
2025-11-03 14:49:49;Feeling alone and stuck;"CW for SA


I feel dramatic saying this out loud, but part of me feels like I will never be romantically loved. I’m 19, not a particularly attractive person, but I always told myself growing up that even if I wasn’t meant to be someone’s wife, at least I could be someone’s one night stand. People aren’t picky about sex, right? So I at least had some value.

Then I started to have symptoms. Started to freak out during any sort of penetration, have these awful panic attacks, completely dissociate for hours. These thoughts kept creeping into my mind about being abused by my neighbor, but I chalked it up to my OCD intrusive thoughts. I was already in therapy for unrelated things, and so I started talking to my therapist about this. She referred me to someone who does EMDR, and about a year later, I actually started that therapy. Except I didn’t remember much about my childhood in general, let alone being abused. It was more of a gut feeling and putting a bunch of pieces together, which is why I never pursued the idea legally or made any accusations. I got my PTSD diagnosis but the EMDR didn’t really help me.

Well my new therapist said I was too complex of a case for her and referred me to a sex therapist. Of course, with this being the good ol US of A, my insurance doesn’t cover ANY sex therapists, so therapy is off the table for me right now.

I guess I’m just stuck in this place where I can’t have sex, I’m too ‘damaged’ for someone to want to deal with me, and me feeling guilty for wanting that for myself. I understand that these aren’t rational feelings, but it doesn’t change them. Most of the time, I’m okay with being alone, but sometimes, I just want someone to hug me and be okay with me not being able to have sex, and loving me anyways. But I’m not sure I’ll ever find that. In my head, I’m not pretty or skinny or amiable enough to be worth the hassle.

I know this sounds dramatic as hell, and I feel that way while typing this, but I just needed to get this off my chest. It feels like it’s crushing me. I have friends and family who love and support me, and I could tell them how I’m feeling, but I know my mom feels guilty, even if she won’t tell me.

i just want an explanation really. every psychiatrist i’ve been to gives me a 5 minute session then throws meds at me, only for those meds to do nothing. they put me through a carousel of diagnoses — schizophrenia and depression and anxiety and bipolar and DMDD and OCD and god knows what else — only for none of the treatments to help. it just feels so fucking invalidating and, really, entirely useless.

So, I'm 30 and have known about my CPTSD for years. Finally got treatment that works pretty well for me. After fighting multiple ""professionals"" on all the things they wanted to diagnose and pill me with.  

Recently, I've had some kind of ""reintergration"" of my Parts. This has done many things, mostly good.. some a little nerve wrecking. But this is good.  

One thing that I believe this is bringing to light is symptoms of ADHD.

 My life-saver therapist who is trained in ADHD has said earlier in our sessions that I should look into the possibility but I brushed her off, saying that CPTSD symptoms can seem like ADHD sometimes.  

But... well, now I'm starting to wonder. My husband has it, we live well together. He was diagnosed late in life, and I have seen how much his medicine has helped him. 


I think my ""ADHD-like"" symptoms are either getting *worse* or becoming more.... obvious. Because now, I don't know? Something in my brain has changed since the re-intergration. And those specific symptoms don't seem to have anything to do with trauma-related anxiety.   


Ugh.. Anyway, I have an appointment with a psych to get a full evaluation. I don't know enough about how ADHD presents in women or what the eval will be. And I have been denying this possibility for years. So I'm not interested in ""faking"" it.  

But I wanted to hear from others. Did you struggle with accepting possible ADHD because you thought it was all just CPTSD? How long did it take you to get a full understanding of what you're rockin with?

2025-11-03 06:55:09;Atypical cptsd diagnosis;"Has anyone here been diagnosed with complex trauma but doesn’t fit the stereotypical criteria often associated with the DSM or, rather, the ICD 10? 

For example, I was diagnosed many years ago with complex trauma but I didn’t experience severe physical or severe emotional abuse and neglect as a child. 

I have always had a more sensitive personality/disposition and experienced a life threatening dog attack @ five that I finally came to understand wired my amygdala for fear in certain situations and maybe just a sensitive nervous system, overall. I’m older and trauma simply wasn’t recognized for most of my life. I also witnessed traumatic deaths/or the aftermath; was teased/bullied by an elder sibling with some narcissistic traits; and was in more than a couple of narcissistic relationships. And I’ve been physically attacked and sexually taken advantage of but never violently. Certain events really affected me too that shook up my sense of safety and having a solid and steady support system growing up. 

I did deal with some emotional neglect within my family and kind of fell through the cracks during junior high and high school as my dad wasn’t emotionally available and I never really knew who I was — still don’t. 

I think my mom tried to shelter me when I’d panic in situations and so I developed a pattern of self sabotaging when feelings of anxiety would rise up in perceived threatening situations and meant well because there just was so much not yet known about the effects of trauma on a developing brain. 

I experienced social anxiety since the age of maybe 13 but there was no name for it until the 90s. I was so relieved to have a name for what I described for years as having stage fright wherever I’d go when I was finally diagnosed at 30, but there was no one who understood how to treat it that I could find at the time. I few years before, At 25 I was diagnosed with depression and when I mentioned how anxiety affected me socially I was just told by the psychiatrist that it was depression. Then I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety also @ 30 and then panic disorder. I then battled agoraphobia for many years. 

Once I was told it was complex trauma it made sense but everything I read now about CPTSD points to severe abuse and neglect and makes feel even more of an anomaly. 

Anyway, I was just curious to hear from others who may not fit the textbook definition but who have received a diagnosis from a therapist. ";r/CPTSD;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1omvivq/atypical_cptsd_diagnosis/

I (21 F) was diagnosed with CPTSD at 15, spent a ton of time in therapy, and ultimately healed about as much as I could have by 21. There's still work to be done, but I also recognize that so much already has been. Recently I've gotten my ability to believe people actually like me to a point where im happy with it and began to move onto how I view myself.

I've been trying new makeup, buying clothes that really suit me, learning to upcycle to make the clothes I have better, getting more tattoos, and trying to figure out the best way to make myself happier in my skin. It's really been working for me, and I've felt myself become so much more comfortable in my actions and efforts on a daily basis that I've started analyzing the way other people interact with me. 

To make a long story short, I've been in a long term relationship for 5 years with someone I mesh very well with. However it's seeming to become clear that my friends treat me more intimatly than he does. They call me nicknames, he calls me my name exclusively, they tell me I look great and I'm pretty, he tells me ""it looks good"" only when I ask how I look, they spend time with me doing things I enjoy that maybe they don't, etc. As I'm trying to understand and enjoy myself more, I'm trying to find my non negotiables. As it stands I don't think that my needs are being met to the standards I hold myself to in my treatment of him. 

I've spent 2-3 months thinking it over, and I'm considering throwing in the towel. However I'm worried that my new found needs don't quite qualify into the ""needs"" category. I'm trying to navigate this situation as carefully as I can without attaching myself to another individual to ""fill the void"" (which is something I've done in the past). 

So I guess my question is, am I overreacting? My partner is nice, and spends some time with me, and it's all things considered stable, and I love him very much. However I don't like how reserved and closed off I've become to him because of my own inner turmoil.

I definitely struggle with insomnia at times but even when I get about 7 hours of sleep I still wake up and spend the day tired and yawning.

Yesterday I slept for a total of 16.5 hours and today I slept for a total of 13 hours. During my nap today I also had a dream about losing a tooth which is usually my clue that I’m probably grinding my teeth when I sleep.

All this is quite new to me, what is “funny” about this story is that I am a social worker in the psychiatric field… I have always taken this role of caregiver without ever telling myself that I myself needed help. 

So, my long journey to healing begins! 
Good luck to everyone!";r/ptsd;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1omujke/i_have_just_been_diagnosed_with_ptsd/
2025-11-03 05:48:14;I was abused by my siblings, but everything is good now, and I've never actually fully told anyone how weird I feel about it [long] [cw for physical and emotional abuse];"I have a very weird relationship when it comes to my PTSD mainly because I'm not used to seeing people talk about sibling abuse, and also because the abuse is over but I'm still like this.

Okay so my twin brother has various neurological disorders that I don’t want to specify for privacy. And when we were younger, he had, I was told, an Intermittent explosive disorder. 

He was violent. Frequently. We couldn’t go to a restaurant without some melt down of banging tables. He’d hit me all the time. I could breathe wrong and I’d get slapped. Sometimes when he was having an episode, I’d run to my room and push against the door to keep him from coming inside. He’d throw things at my door like his trash can, and he’d say he wasn’t going to hit me. You’ll never guess what happened if I opened the door. This also extended to my stuff. I don’t want to give too many details even if they are silly things to exclude, but I collected stuff that was kind of fragile and I would display it on top of my drawer. He would come into my room, hit me, and then knock all my stuff to the floor. Rinse and repeat.

But he was also my twin, we did everything together. If you’re a twin you’ll know that you are “the twins” more often than you are just you. It’s not just that we were siblings, but I literally never knew a life without him. So we’d play with legos together, play video games, watch TV, and it would be so nice, but all I can ever remember was it ending in him getting mad and hitting me. 

I love my parents. I do. They have done so much for me, but goddamn did they drop the ball when I was a kid. They were very preoccupied with my brother, taking him to all sorts of therapists trying all sorts of things. They tried their best. They always tried to stop him and scold him and comfort me, but I fell into the pattern of keeping myself locked in my room and being the “easy” child. 

There’s also the fact that my brother wasn’t and isn’t a bad person. We were kids. He’d feel bad and apologize but he had these impulses and would just get so angry. He was a victim of himself.

Eventually enough was enough and my parents knew they needed a major change. That if he stayed home he would never get the help he needed, so they sent him to a therapy boarding school in another state. This ended up being the greatest decision my parents could have made. Mind you, we didn’t just send him away and turn around. We would visit all the time and have family therapy there and he’d come home plenty. It was exactly what he needed. He was basically a different person when his time there ended. Honestly it scares me to think what life would have been like if my parents hadn’t been able to afford to send him there. I’m not sure I’d be alive.

While he was away I had time to sit and actually process everything that had happened to me. I was 12 at that point and I had spent pretty much all those 12 years burying everything inside me. So what do you do when the cause of your torment is away and you don’t feel any better?

So yeah, after folding in on myself I started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. There were names to the faces but I was too young to see the revelation as anything other than proof of failure. 

“Something is wrong with me,” I said.

“Something *is* wrong with you,” they said.

And I didn’t listen to any of the words after. 

Funny thing. I was diagnosed with PTSD, apparently, before I started seeing a therapist regularly (my history with therapy is a whole other can of worms). Like a good chunk of years before. 

This both was and was not communicated to me. My mom would sometimes say something was “because of my PTSD” but I thought this was like, a self-diagnosing thing. Assigned PTSD by Mom. But I eventually learned I had been diagnosed with C-PTSD. which was a wild fucking bombshell when it was told to me outright by my therapist. I considered myself to have it already, but it was a wild bombshell to take into my freshman year of high school. 

I have a sister too, by the way. We had two opposite reactions to the situation. I holed up in my room, she stayed out of the house. I don’t know everything that was going on with her. I can speculate and hypothesize but I don’t think I’ll ever actually know. It’s not a conversation either of us want to have. It’s likely we’ll never have it.

But my sister took a hammer to my self esteem when we were kids. This is the part where I don't know how to communicate with people. The extent of my sister’s meanness. Far beyond what normal siblings do. She made sure that I knew that I was a freak and that everyone thought I was annoying. Anything I liked was weird and I was actually faking any niceties. I was secretly a terrible person, she insisted. And you know what? When you’re already fucked up and this time you aren’t getting hit, you are far more prone to dishing out what you get served. I was nasty, but I swear, it was never on her level. My mom would jump in when my sister was being especially mean. 

I want to stress that. My parents were there, they carried about all of us, but they didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. But goddamn they tried. They still do. 

I’m still shaking off what my sister insisted when we were younger. Still trying to convince myself that my presence isn’t always unwanted. That my interests aren’t weird. That I was something more than worthless.

And here’s the thing. My sister got better. 

She still has her mean streaks. But our relationship is so much better than it ever had been. She’s a lot more aware. She’s grown so much. Things are better. 

And that’s the problem.

Things are better, but I’m not.



What do you do when it’s over? What do you do when it’s over and you still need time to physically recover after the sound of a fire alarm or a phone clashing to the floor. 

What do you do when it’s over and you still brace yourself to be hit when someone moves their arm too fast? 

What do you do when you still believe every bad thing about yourself. When you’re so mad at the people who hurt you, that you want the world to know what they did, but you love them too much to say anything. 

I have a good life. I have people who support me, a family that loves me, I don’t want for anything. 

I struggle with the classic “I wasn’t abused enough so I need to get over it.” I’m also so far separated from what happened that it doesn’t feel real.  But if I actually think about what it felt like at the time it all comes rushing back. I’m there but I’m not. 

I’m at a weird part of my healing process. I’m so self aware yet I’m so desperate for the old comfort of misery.

But I can’t do that. I have school, I have to find a job, I have to exist and keep going. I can’t be a scared, sad 10-year-old my entire life, sitting in the corner of my room and crying to Three Days Grace.

What’s weird is, I’m so separated from it that most of my friends just…don’t know. In elementary school, it wasn’t something I could hide from. Plenty of my peers had been in my house when my brother lost his temper. But then middle school, and high school, and college, and now nobody knows. 

I want them to. I want them to but I don’t want them to look at my brother any differently. I want to but who am I to air out my family’s dirty laundry? And yet I’m so desperate to be seen.

I don’t know whether to open the box or bury it in the dirt.

I’m still getting better. I’m still trying.

I think about various quotes all culminating into this one thing I tell myself:

“Life goes on and so do I. I don’t want to, but who else is there but me?”

I don’t think that saying would be enough for most other people, but I don’t know. It’s enough for me.

Sorry this is so long.



Thank you for reading.

2025-11-03 03:39:53;Flashbacks during weed induced psychosis;"A little background about me, my entire life i have felt like there was something inside me that was almost like a blockage, a wall, something that made me different to the people around me. I dont form close attachments to people despite being in several long term relationships. I love people in the sense that I choose to. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and ADHD and i’ve been having a lot of intense emotions and depressive episodes lately. Regarding my mental health I have always had a voice inside me telling me that i’m lying or exaggerating despite the fact that my everyday life is a struggle because of my disorders. I’m medicated but very treatment resistant. I dont know if my medication is relevant but I take bupropion 450 mg, latuda 20 mg, atomoxetine 80 mg & trileptal 300 mg.
I’m a regular weed smoker and have been smoking even if not habitually at times since i was 18. I’m 26 now. I’ve never experienced paranoia or anxiety when smoking.
Lately i have had several psychotic episodes when high. The last one was the most intense and because of the fear of the visual hallucinations I think I dissociated, i came to on the floor with someone physically restrained me and covered my mouth, at the beginning it was the “demons” i was seeing attack me and then i realized it was a person too. I immediately ran, hurting myself in the process, but the fear was visceral. I should probably mention that I’ve started having an aversion to being touched lately and during this episode even my hair touching my face triggered me in a way where I felt violated, people rubbing my arm or any part of my body now feels like it overstimulates me and is unbearable and this feel started shortly before this episode. Anyway, when I had started to calm down and the psychosis was fading I could suddenly see a flashback of being younger and being restrained with an adult on top of me the same way i was restrained and triggered into fight or flight during the episode. It didn’t feel like the memory came to but rather that it was there all along and despite my mind doubting everything I fear this time it didn’t. I almost felt whole seeing it in a sick way, like I could finally understand my behavior throughout the years. I’m wondering if this might be a false memory or not because throughout my life whenever I was confused as to why me emotions and reactions were so intense for no reason, why I live in guilt and shame and fear and have for as long as I remember. There are a lot of details missing here but this is already long enough. My question is that during moments where I would try to understand the answer that would come to mind was this particular person abusing me at a specific point in my life that I do not remember. I’ve always shrugged it off as me being dramatic or want a reason or creating a reason. But this time, for the first time in my life while having those flashbacks i felt something in me connect, the pain was intense, I could physically feel a lot of it, the sense of fear and violation was so strong in my body. I’m confused and I don’t understand why I am the way I am, I’ve been going through mental health crisis for the past 2 years and started showing signs of possible dissociation. Is what I saw a false memory? Is it in someway my mind trying to validate my pain? I say that and something in me says no, that it makes too much sense, that I didn’t feel like it was an intrusive or external memory, it was just there all of a sudden and it was incredibly painful to experience. It’s been a few days and i’ve fallen back into the habit of just brushing it off but something, something in me cannot let it go. Is this a false memory? If it is then what is wrong with me? Why do I feel like something is missing inside me? How can I tell?

2025-11-03 01:57:47;Does anybody else feel isolated?;"Hi 👋 thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and witness/relate to me. 

I have made a lot of progress on my journey to recovery after being diagnosed in 2021. I am trying to put myself out there more and form a solid community. It has been touch and go-which is to be expected since I struggle with attachment issues due to my experiences growing up. Regardless of how much I have grown, I still find myself feeling so lonely. Even after being married for years I feel so alone. I feel separate from this world-almost like I don’t belong. I often find myself searching for a sense of home in relationships with others-when I don’t find it, I feel abandoned, leading to further feelings of being disconnected from community. It saddens me because I used to have so many friends around me. My therapist says this is a symptom that often comes with CPTSD. I really hope I don’t have to feel this way for the rest of my life.

Does anyone relate to this feeling? If you do, what tools do you use to feel better?  Even if you don’t have a solution, please share your experience-it’ll help me feel a little less alone.";r/CPTSD;24;7;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1omo2nn/does_anybody_else_feel_isolated/
2025-11-02 23:40:57;Can non sexual related PTSD cause sexual problems?;"I am diagnosed with PTSD that as far as I know isn’t related to sexual abuse, and I’ve never been sexually abused. I have many many problems either trusting people and becoming close to people, but in an intimate way too. I remember I was kissed on the mouth up until I was around 11 I think? And showered with my parents and sister up until about that same age. I also have something I feel so guilty about, I don’t really want to say it, but I feel like I have to in this context. i don’t remember how old I was, I think up until about 10, when she was 6. I used to touch my sister inappropriately, when we were tickling each other I tickled her private parts, because I knew she was sensitive there. I still feel so guilty, I know I was too young and not educated enough to know what I was doing was wrong. Both my parents and my sister also used to slap my butt until I told them to stop and they sometimes still slip up and do it. That’s all I can remember that could have triggered this, but like I said, I’ve never been SA’d or abused. I have had some problems though lately. First thing, my sister is 10 now and sometimes says things in a flirty tone to me, calls me “babe” (or something’s like that) and touched me in ways I’m not okay with (no private parts, but sexual ways of touching for example my thighs or hugging me from behind) which I know she probably has from the internet and doesn’t know why it’s wrong, but I feel very disgusting anytime she does it (she also touches herself in semi public places and still walks naked around the house). I’m also so scared of hugs or anyone touching me or being close to me, but that may just be the trust issues and the fact that I’m queer and scared of being labeled as a creep. So yeah, my sister makes me very uncomfortable and I feel so guilty about what I did to her and I can’t make normal friendships, because I just can’t get physically close to them, only emotionally.

2025-11-02 22:28:31;My mother thinks I need therapy “because I don’t love my mother.” Absolutely not.;"So here’s how absurd this has gotten.

My mom’s abuse code word my whole life was “get help”, followed by police calls, lies and complete shutdown of communication. Like I’m malfunctioning because I don’t fit her fantasy version of reality. So I ask the most obvious question a rational adult would ask:

“Help for what?”

She doesn’t answer me. She doesn’t even look at me.
She turns her head, lowers her voice like she’s delivering a movie monologue to the floor, and says:

“Because you don’t love your mother.”

That’s not a reason for therapy.
That’s not a diagnosis.
That’s not concern.
That’s psychological warfare disguised as concern.

What she really means is:
“Go to therapy until you agree with me and do what I want.”

It’s control, not help.

And the hilarious part? I had just bought a house. I moved here. I’m a grown adult who takes care of my life. I’ve built things, achieved things, stayed alive through more adversity than she has ever experienced. If someone said this was a movie plot, no one would believe the mom character because it’s too stupid.

My mom’s entire “therapy = love your mother” logic is basically:
	•	I don’t have to change anything
	•	You must change everything
	•	If you refuse, you’re “broken”
	•	And the solution is “get help,” meaning “become the version of you in my head”

It’s laughable.

I don’t need “help because I don’t love my mother.”
I need distance because MY MOTHER DOESN’T RESPECT REALITY.

Any time I defend myself?
They escalate.
They cut contact.
They send police.
They make up stories.
They refuse to speak like adults.

That’s not parenting, that’s psychological terrorism in slow motion.

And the most insulting piece:
They were barely present for my adult life.
They don’t know who I am.
They don’t know what I do.
They don’t know anything I’ve built.

But somehow they “diagnose” me?

No. Absolutely not.

The only real answer is no contact.
Therapy isn’t the solution to someone else’s delusion.

If the “professional” answer is that I’m supposed to sit quietly while she writes fan-fiction about my life and expects me to play the role she assigns, then the real professional answer is:

remove the source of abuse.

2025-11-02 22:11:37;Feeling so much guilt for wanting to register for accommodations in college;"I'm in my second year of college and I was able to get a PTSD diagnosis very recently. I've been wanting to register with my school's disability resource center to hopefully get some form of accommodations for my PTSD but just the thought of doing this makes me feel so guilty. I've been dealing with trauma since I was 12 and I feel like if I was ""handling"" it well in my high school years despite it being much worse than it was now, I shouldn't be ""making excuses"" for myself now and getting ""unnecessary"" help. I can't help but compare myself to my high school self; even though I was actively experiencing multiple traumatic events, myself in high school still got all A's, took 11 AP classes, achieved prestigious accomplishments on an instrument, was an active member of extracurriculars, volunteered throughout the community, and had friendships. Now I have the lowest GPA I've ever had before and the only person I talk to on a regular basis is my partner. Even though I'm away from an abusive environment now and have enrolled in therapy, it feels like my body and mind can't keep up anymore. I don't feel up to hanging out with people even if I like them, I feel overwhelmed, my body feels weak and tired a lot of the time, and my thoughts race uncontrollably. I know that there's other factors I'm dealing with that I didn't have to deal with in high school but I can't help but feel terrible about the fact that even though I'm in a ""better place"" now than I was in the past years, I'm struggling just as much if not more. I can't help but feel like I'm just trying to find excuses for myself to not work hard and that I'm not being disciplined enough in my studies and social life.

2025-11-02 18:12:30;It turns out I don't have ptsd. But my trauma is still significantly impacting me as if I did and without a diagnosis or access to therapy there's not anything I can really do.;"I don't have access to therapy, there are no therapists covered by my medicaid and I cannot afford anything out of pocker
pocket

However, I have been in therapy in the past and tried things like EMDR as well as several other different forms of therapy and nothing worked. Nothing made me any better or any worse, any and every kind of therapy I've tried, which was almost 10 different forms and I cannot remember the name of them all off the top of my mind, all just simply had no effect on me long term. And now that I have become poor financially, I cannot continue to try even more therapy unless this changes someday. 

But, I did manage to get assessed for ptsd. With the type of trauma I have, I even thought I may have CPTSD, since my whole life has been trauma after trauma. I definitely have several symptoms of PTSD that significantly impact my daily life and functioning. 

However, I do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, because even though I scored ""severe"" and ""very severe"" in some diagnostic categories, I scored ""minimal"" in some categories that are required to score much higher on for a PTSD diagnosis. 

The categories I scored ""minimal"" on was something like ""sense of threat"" and ""functioning""

But I believe the ""functioning"" section was inaccurate because the questions asked didn't apply to me. I was asked things like ""how much has your symptoms impacted your ability to parent, do school, do work, your social life"" but none of these things apply. I don't have kids, I'm not in school and I don't work, and I don't have very much of a social life. I have no friends that live close enough so I never see my friends in person, and I have just 3 people in my immediate family, none of which who I see every day. 
So of course my answer was either ""not at all"" or ""a little bit"" to all of these questions, since none of them really apply to me in the first place

I don't believe this is an accurate reflection of how my symptoms have impacted my functioning though. They DO severely impact my functioning. They impact my sleep. They impact my focus. They steal so much time for me that I couldve used for something productive or fun because instead I go through every flashback alone. No one in my life has ever seen me go through a flashback. And I have flashbacks most days of the week. 

However, as for the ""sense of threat"" category, I do believe this one was accurate, as I do not have anxiety and I am not hypervigiliant or jumpy/restless.

So even if the ""functioning"" section was revised questions that actually applied to me, the ""sense of threat"" section would still be the same, so I still would not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.

I don't want to have PTSD, but this just feels so incredibly invalidating. Without any diagnosis in the DSM that matches, and no access to therapy anymore, I just feel as if I've reached the end of the road. It's just an empty road.

I like to run, before I got really bad ptsd I would run 5-6 miles three times a week. Now I can only run 2. I’m getting back in shape but have an issue.

My ptsd is mostly physical symptoms until it isn’t. After I run my heart rate will go down like normal to a few beats over resting.

2025-11-02 02:14:53;Diagnosed with PTSD for the first time in my life, after experiencing threats to my life and wellbeing for seven months. Plus being discredited by an idiot doctor who locked me inside a hospital for a month, because he thought I had a psychotic episode.;"This is the craziest shit I've experienced. I moved to a new neighborhood in town. A few months after, I started getting threats to my life and wellbeing, without doing anything wrong to anybody. I believe it's a sociopath or group of sociopaths, spreading lies and bad rumours about me. 

The police is helping me fortunately. I'm about to kick their fucking ass and turn their life projects into ruins. I'm not joking. Fortunately, I'm very watchful and I'm working to get revenge on those worms.

Getting locked inside the hospital was really bad too. First of all, the idiot doctor discredited my experiences, which made my family also discredit them more. Then I got locked inside a hospital for one month.

The last two years have been really crazy. But I'm never giving up. I'm working with the police now to teach those worms a lesson, that they targeted the wrong person and family. I'm not joking when I say I have many gigabytes of evidence against them, for committing very serious crimes. It could give them jail time for years, millions in fines, life trauma, and their life projects turned into ruins. They will be very busy with the consequences of their actions in the future. Sad for them if they have other things in life, they'd rather prioritize. I will not give up until they get serious consequences for this.

I'm also going to sue the hospital and doctor who discredited me. Fortunately, I have overwhelming evidence that they've been wrong the whole time. So I will not give up here either, until I get some compensation.

I just want to thank this group for existing. I just joined. It's nice to have a place where I can vent with people who can relate and give solid advice.

I'm going to chill with my two loving furball cats, Battlefield 6 and Mortal Kombat to ease the anxiety and stress. Another way that helps me cope, is working with the police and law to get some revenge on those worms, causing this. Then I can look back on this and think ""I did everything I could to get some justice and so others don't become victims."", no matter what happens. I'm very proud of myself.

If they want to stop me, they'll have to kill me. I'm that determined.

After 10 months of keeping silent about it, I(26f) told 2 of my ‘friends’ (25m) (24f) everything my ex did to me, along with photo evidence. I wont go into detail but I experienced every type of abuse. 

They listened to me, but when i wanted to tell them more about it they were ‘too tired and had to work in the morning’, despite me travelling 3 hours to anotesee them. They also actually knew a lot more than I thought they did. 

I have not heard from them in over 3 months. And i don’t expect to. 

They are friends with my abuser, one of them is in business with him (25m) and they are “very close”.  I was the one to introduce them to one another. 

I didn’t say anything to them for 10 months because in my gut i knew this would be the outcome. I realised before saying anything that the friendship was one sided and that it was more in my head than in reality. that’s fine. I expected it. but there was a tiny sliver of hope that thought they might care enough to not want to be around him. and there was a tiny bit of me that hoped i was wrong about our ‘friendship’. 

I regret telling them because I feel completely humiliated down to my core. The fact that they didn’t care enough to hear me out, when I stayed at a (loud af) hostel for 2 nights, travelled 3 hours to see them, recounted the abuse which was so traumatic i spent the rest of the entire night sobbing and not sleeping and mildly hallucinating, and then had to leave their city in the morning  to go straight to work (a 4 hour journey) (i also was unable to eat out of anxiety for the whole week after ). all of this to tell them, and they couldn’t be bothered to go to the pub opposite their house with me, so I could tell them more in detail what happened. 

It’s clear to me that it’s because they simply didn’t want to know more. 

I also know that they are not my friends and that they never were. I have absolute clarity about this. I also know that my ex has said whatever he’s said to make it seem like I was abusive too, that there were things i did to deserve it, or that I was exaggerating. i also know that this is none of my business and has nothing to do with me and that whatever he says doesn’t take away from the reality of what he did to me.  

I spent so much time in therapy, reached out to  a DV charity and had a case worker then a DV counsellor for 3 months. I couldn’t work full time for months and got insane cystic acne for the first time ever. I eventually sorted myself out and a now doing well and am fairly stable and happy enough with the life i’m building for myself. 

I can’t however stop thinking about how much it hurts. not only the abuse from my ex which I still get nightmares and flashbacks ( I was diagnosed with ptsd from it), but about how those 2 ‘friends’ just took his side. i feel so betrayed and it physically hurts my heart when i think about it all which is every single day multiple times a day. 

i know i need to focus on myself. i am and i’m doing ok. I’m going to start EMDR therapy soon, and need to reach out to my normal therapist. i need to do more things that make me happy like going out dancing, going to the gym, seeing (my fantastic)  friends etc and i am. i  just don’t know how to stop thinking about this every single day. 

any advice or personal stories would help. I’d just like to feel a little less alone in this. 

thanks for reading this far if you have! x

I am mostly retired, but still working (part-time) in my field.

Lately, I have experienced vivid and extremely horrifying nightmares, which my wife says are accompanied by extended periods of thrashing, growling, screaming, and kicking during my ""sleep"". She has not been able to awaken me during these elongated episodes of nighttime terror.

When I finally ""awaken,"" I am drenched in sweat, exhausted, and often go back to sleep for an extended period to recover the REM sleep I was deprived of.

I am unable to work even part-time as a result of the effects of sleep deprivation I am experiencing.

Are any treatment options open to me? I have previously experienced positive results from EMDR therapy, but this is a new (and frightening) challenge.

2025-10-31 12:08:43;I went a bit crazy with diagnosis;"I went a bit crazy wanting an official assessment and diagnosis, I paid a private psychiatrist for this. I don't know why I did it considered I already spoke to mental health and had referral for therapy. 
I think I just wanted to acknowledge to myself a label for what happened to me and the symptoms I'm experiencing, after suffering alone and chaotically for months. I wanted to have it written on a piece of paper and hold it in my hands.

I feel I did something wrong to me, paying and sitting down retelling my story boldly. I didn't care retraumatising myself as long as I heard myself saying things loud.

I think I wanted to feel more in control.

2025-10-31 09:26:49;Why do triggers feel so stupid?;"I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD and I am not asking for one from anyone in this subreddit, so sorry it I’m not supposed to be here, but I found this subreddit and figured this would be the best place to vent. 

I got 2 tests back and basically everything was wrong and I couldn’t figure out what corrections I needed to make, so I raised my hand for help and waited, I counted 5 others who they had helped who asked after me, and I get they were going by who they sew, but I just started spiraling.

I don’t want to go into a panic attack over the fear of disappointing my abusive and neglectful parents, or at the site of a test marked wrong bringing me back to being in elementary school, scared and on my own. I know it’s my inner child, and I don’t blame them for panicking, but why over a couple of college tests?

I’ve known for years that they were never going to care about me, never going to see me as anything more then their disabled mistake, I’ve managed on my own my whole childhood, and I know these teachers actually care, I know I’m safe, so why doesn’t my inner child? I don’t want something as inconsequential as school work making me feel like nothing in my life has changed.

ngl im not entirely sure why, my best guess is that im vigilant of being triggered so when i do it on purpose im sort of ""taking control"". and in general i really havent processed my trauma very much or at all so maybe this is my fucked up way of doing it. still i would love some tips on this...";r/ptsd;5;6;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1okbe1v/dae_purposefully_trigger_themself_and_how_to_stop/
2025-10-30 22:28:40;Diseaster;"I am 32 year old male today I want to share my life story here

Life till now :

So I was born in a family where nothing was normal from outside we look happy 
But internally it was all messed up

My father was big time acholic there was only domestic violence and fighting each day 

So from the ages of 1-13 years I used to sleep in my parents room where my father used to beat my mom merecilssy they used to have sex infront of me everyday and it was forced sex to be honest as my mother was scared to reject they used to have sex infront of me they thought I was sleeping but the truth I was not 
And whenever my father used to hug me I feel very scared and uncomfortable and while hugging he used to say many bad words like motherfucker bitch in my ears to my mom 

The result by the age of 8-9 I started masturbating and by the age of 12 I become very hypersexual and wanted to have sex with anybody to release or renact those things 

So I remember when I was 12 years old a elder boy around the age of 18 come to our house he was our servant elder brother so my mom told me to play with him and what a idiot I was as I told you I already was hypersexual I was on his lap rubbing my penis on his chest though it was under my pants then I donot why he showed me his penis and then hide it by saying it is elder thing then later on I was rubbing my penis on his back until I discharge he never told me to stop it 

I also become a abuser myself at the age of 16

From there I started having sex with boys of my age from the ages of 12-18 till then I stopped it as it brings nothing but shame and guilt 

Then I had also sex with women and transwomen as well 

I am struggling with homosexuality/bisexuality porn and masturbation addiction and smoking addiction pied from last 20 years 

I know those events has shaped my sexuality my behaviours till this date and more I live the more I hate myself 

I was never born this way and now I have destroyed my life completely 

I was taking therapy in which I was diagnosed with adhd as well

I failed to be good son failed to be good brother failed to become a good friend 
I failed in all

2025-10-29 19:21:08;Do I still have PTSD?;"(Mention of domestic abuse) I (f22) wanna start off by saying I was never formally diagnosed, as I never went to therapy cause I thought the symptoms would go away on their own. My dad physically abused my mom in front of us throughout my whole childhood, things would get ugly, many times I thought he had killed her when I found laying on the floor, it was so bad that one time when I was 8 I had to call the police. From 2017~2022 things got better, they would RARELY physically fight. But in 2022 he became a coke addict and one night he punched my mom in the face one last time before she finally sued. I remember waiting for my mom at home and seeing my dad instead coming home with blood on his hands, rambling about random stuff and threatening to kill her. Prior to that day I never experienced PTSD symptoms, so when they all exploded at once I was obviously concerned: I would get startled by anything, even just a pen falling on the floor, I’d have recurring nightmares almost every night, I would excessively sigh all the time, have flashbacks etc. 
As time went through most of these symptoms “calmed down”, but I still have nightmares from time to time (twice this week), I still get extremely anxious when I hear a door lock, but now I started experiencing memory loss and emotional numbness. I wish I could feel fucking sad about this, I wish I could feel something really even if it’s bad, rather than nothing.
I thought i somehow got rid of my ptsd by avoiding anything regarding those events, but it feels like it’s starting to come back or mildly settle down.  ";r/ptsd;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1oj1twd/do_i_still_have_ptsd/

2025-10-28 19:25:18;Just seeking encouragement.;"Hi everyone! I’m not used to talking about myself (especially my traumas), but my DBT therapist thinks it’d be helpful to disclose my trauma to those who may understand and not invalidate or blame me. So here it goes: 

I was sexually assaulted from age 5 - 10 by my cousin, “Michael” (not his real name), on my mom’s side. My parents allowed him to live with us after the fact because he didn’t want to move with his mom to MN and, according to my mom, my dad thought it was the Christian thing to do (he was a new convert). Even though my abused mom was the breadwinner, Vietnam vet dad was the leader of the household, and, whatever he dictated went. Anyway one day my parents were talking and I felt someone staring at me. I saw my mom staring at me from their bedroom, but she had a weird countenance and I couldn’t place it then. I was used to hearing my parents say good things about me so I walked over to their room and stood at the threshold (dad was sitting on their bed behind the door and mom was at the foot of the bed folding laundry. So mom knew I was there, dad didn’t). I guess they were discussing my rape before I arrived cuz mom was still staring at me when she said “she probably liked it.” I shot her a disgusted look and turned around and sat back down on the chair. Then my dad called me to their room and told me that Michael would be staying with us. I yelled “it doesn’t matter what he wants, he can’t stay here!!” I was proud of myself… for finally standing up for myself (I was bullied throughout middle school and developed severe suicidal ideation), but then my dad shot me down when he yelled “SHUT UP!” I was a daddy’s girl and I tried honoring my parents as best as I could throughout my young life so his response (and mom’s loud silence) killed the dutiful daughter they knew. I became extremely rebellious henceforth.  

3 years passed: Mike’s still there and the bullying at school got worse. I then beat up my bully, but my dad would later pass away in ‘97 when I was 4 months shy of 14 and heading into high school. I almost took my life several times that year. My therapist wasn’t helpful cuz I told him all the right things so that he could dismiss me. I absolutely and passionately hated God at that point, too, but made a deal with Him because I was desperate. I didn’t want to die, I just wanted the pain of living to stop... Anywho, He kept His side of the bargain so I kept mine and accepted Yeshua as my Lord and savior. Then I began healing! Mike moved out during my senior year, but the damage had already been done.

2001 comes and I leave for university 3 states away believing I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I soon realized I didn’t so I ended up changing majors twice over the following 2 years. Realized I was wasting time and money so I became a trucker at 21 so I could earn money while figuring out what career I needed. I’m good at many things but not very passionate about them and I can’t do something simply for the pay. 

A few years into driving big rig, I needed to reset my hours in my hometown. I asked my mom if I could reset my hours at her house and she said I needed to ask Mike for permission since “he was there first.” I was deeply hurt and felt betrayed, but I dismissed it because I didn’t want to rock the boat with an already sinking ship that was our relationship. So I slept in my truck instead. No one would rent to me due to lack of rental history and mom wouldn’t vouch for me so I was stuck. 

A few years later, I was raped by my then current boyfriend in November 2008 and conceived that night also. I wasn’t aware of my pregnancy until a month later, however. My mom basically begged me to not abort the baby while my sister (a jaded mom and ex; never wanted to be a statistic so she took it out on her daughter but that’s another story) begged me to. None of them knew I conceived by rape, tbf. When I prayed about it (I wasn’t sure I could be the mother s/he needed at the time), I was warned that my journey would be difficult and some other potential issues. I decided to adopt him out instead of abort cuz it’s not his fault this all happened. Anywho, my pregnancy was very difficult, I got fired from my racist trucking company while on restrictions (which they got sued into oblivion for discrimination), but they didn’t fight my unemployment claims so that was a blessing. I had pre-eclampsia during the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy and I then gave birth to a healthy 10 lbs 13 oz baby boy (emergency c-section)! When I saw him, I fell in love and I knew I couldn’t give him up! So we began our journey together. About a month later, I was trying to breast feed him and couldn’t breathe with him pressed against my chest. Little did I know, I contracted pneumonia while in the hospital and was dangerously low on oxygen (almost died per the cardiologist). We were in the hospital for a few days until my congestive heart failure subsided. SO… apparently half of that prophecy was true, and, today, I’m suspicious of the other part but it remains to be seen.

Since then, I met a wonderful man who fell in love with my son (they both have severe ADHD and I learned, via my son’s therapy and our family parenting classes, that I have ADHD, too, it just shows up differently in females most times) and wanted to marry me 3 months into our relationship but he patiently waited for me (I wasn’t sure for many reasons and then we had many ups and downs throughout the relationship, but got everything squared away eventually). I’ve had issues with keeping jobs, interacting with some people (two most recent were white female trainers/supervisors from WFH positions), and other issues related to my traumas (e.g. emotional regulation, visual hallucinations, etc.).  I’ve also had issues with bullying from a couple of older maternal family members, but more on that later!

I began attending various DBT sessions starting in 2020, got diagnosed with BPD among other disorders and finally landed a good independent behavioral health center in 2024 (year long waitlist). It combines both 2.5 hour long weekly DBT class with a now 3.5 hours combined (2 separate days) DBT therapist (and this doesn’t include my almost daily recorded prolonged exposure sessions). This is way more intense than my previous DBT classes and there’s more accountability here, too. Other noteworthy happenings since 2020 are: we got married in February 2021 at our home, I finally stood up to the main bully on my mom’s side of the family also in 2021 with receipts of my childhood rape. She accused me of lying (in 2016) cuz there’s “no way [my mom] would’ve let Michael stay after the fact” and Michael was her favorite lil cousin. She didn’t apologize for calling me a liar, but she apologized for not believing the rumors… I confronted my ex favorite aunt earlier this year and she’s been a little nicer since then. I’ve also asked my mom a couple times (once in 2015 and the other this year) to apologize for accusing me of “probably liking [the rape].” I re-explained the many violations inflicted upon me with great detail… So, in 2015, she apologized for making me “feel that way” and this year she flat out denied it ever happened (even though she remembers the other half of that convo when dad yelled shut up). So she apologized for dad yelling at me, but won’t admit to her mistake in any way this time… I am, however, trying to give her grace this time around because she’s getting older and more forgetful, but then I circle back to the fact that she remembered dad’s part of the convo but conveniently forgets her part… Anywho, I apologized to Michael’s son’s mom this year for not coming forward back then with the rape before she had his son. To be fair I thought she knew for some reason and was shocked that she didn’t so I showed her the receipts, too, via fb. She had a lot of questions, but was totally shocked and sorry that no one protected us back then. This woman showed me more care, concern, compassion, validation, and respect than my parents ever did and I cried. Hard! Then, this past Saturday, I talked with my older female paternal cousin (she noticed I recently left fb and wanted to talk with me so gave me her number via my mom) and she was extremely pissed about this revelation RE the sexual abuse. I thanked her for being mad with me, but told her we don’t need her going back to prison! 😅 She was also upset with how the family (dad’s side) mistreated me in a group chat RE our aunt with dementia recently, but I think I exited gracefully (never stay where you’re unappreciated and I didn’t allow my pride to make me stay). There were more familial revelations and confirmations during our 3.5 hr conversation and she made me feel so seen, heard, valued, understood, and validated! I apologized for angering her with my experiences, but she explained that big-hearted people like us don’t deserve mistreatment and that’s what pissed her off. Plus she explained that she wished someone would have called her about the school bullying because she liked defending her little cousins! Lol. I’ve been getting better at disclosing my traumas and I’ve realized that just because others may invalidate my traumas, doesn’t make my experiences invalid or easy. 

And that’s it, folks! I don’t even know how I should TL;DR this one so I’m leaving it how it is. Thank you 🙏🏽 for reading this far and take care!

 It hasn't been as bad for a long time, because therapy helped. I thought i was finally healed, like i was fully just done. Nothing has triggered me in a while. (Thought it was a year, now that i think about it, probably a few months) 
I was particularly on edge yesterday. My mom was driving me to a shop because we had ordered some stuff, and suddenly she makes the decision to just drop me off alone. Major trigger, apparently, because I freeze up completely and she starts yelling at me. I used to struggle with going to shops and going outside because it caused severe anxiety in me.

I feel like the people around me just kind of forget, I've never been able to properly articulate what i went through because it just doesn't sound like something you get trauma from and i also forgot most of it.

2025-10-28 09:45:58;Best as needed medication? Also a vent.;"I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago due to childhood trauma and a 5 year DV relationship, and after my initial diagnosis 2 more severely traumatic events happened. 

1. I was violently raped by an acquaintance.
2. My former fiance cornered me in the kitchen with 2 guns, handed me one, and said it was me or him. Held me at gunpoint and I fully believe he was going to kill me and claim self defense, except someone showed up to the house and interrupted him.  I have not dated anyone since, and that was over 10 years ago.

I am always on high alert around men, but  the industry I work in is male dominated. We have 225 employees in my position, and only 4 are female. I try to be cordial with the men in general, and I try to be diplomatic if they come on to me. There's one particular person that ive turned down several times. He goes out of his way to find reasons to touch me. I mostly try to avoid him, but it's impossible since we work together. 

Last week I was doing my job, and I was super focused on what I was doing at that moment. I took a step backwards and all the sudden someone grabbed me from behind, locked his arms around me. I didnt hear him approach. I froze for a moment, and then I screamed and tried to break free. He said to me ""you have to be aware of your surroundings, I could've dragged you away"" and let me go. I spun around and backed up. When he saw how upset I was, he tried to play it off by saying he's a character and he's always joking. This sent me into a full blown ptsd event that has lasted for a week so far. Nightmares, very little sleep, high BP, the whole bit. 

I dont want to take medication daily, I would prefer to take something on an as needed basis. My industry is heavily regulated, and psych meds are scrutinized intensely. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist wednesday, but looking to see if anyone has any suggestions. Primarily I want to avoid anything that makes you drowsy. I just can't live like this.

2025-10-28 04:54:38;Work accommodations;"So, I think I have PTSD. I’m in the UK, my GP said it sounds like I have it. I know this isnt official by any means, but I haven’t got the time or mental capacity right now to start the official diagnosis process

My problem is, my trauma stems from my old friend. And the kicker is, my boss is her cousin. AKA, the woman I work alongside every single day. I have panic attacks when I see my old friend’s relatives, so you can imagine working alongside her cousin every day isn’t good for me. Her relatives have started (this month) to come into work. I have a panic attack every time. 

I’m thinking of telling my manager that I’m struggling. I currently work in a library. I would love some accommodations put in place for me, but idk what. I’ve lived like this at my job for almost 2 years now, so I’m definitely used to it. But I am more and more drained as the weeks go by.

2025-10-28 04:40:55;does this shit ever stop coming up?;"so I was diagnosed with ptsd a couple years ago, went to therapy for a couple months, and then kinda just left it.  it wasn't debilitating or anything and therapy was inaccessible to me for a variety of reasons so I kinda just let time do its thing.  I would say im mostly healed, I don't really have many triggers anymore and for the most part im fully functional and generally happy

but does it ever stop just coming up in my thoughts randomly? I still have some of my old compulsions sometimes like intentionally triggering myself with videos of that night or news articles.  every time I see a relevant social media account I compulsively scroll down in their feed to that day to see what they said about it, almost like I can't stop looking at a time capsule. I really can't go more than a day or two without thinking about it, and I know that it's going to get worse as it gets closer to the anniversary.  I have to plan things I am excited about doing around the anniversary because im not sure I will be able to enjoy them when the time comes

it makes it so much worse that my sibling is in the same year of uni as I was when it happened so I keep just feeling so much grief over the years of my uni experience that I feel like were ripped away from me

Unfortunately, it wasnt the first time it happened but it’s the one that left me feeling most broken. After the SA happened, my current therapist told me i need to seek out trauma therapy (she’s not trained in trauma therapy). I’ve been seeking out trauma therapy with a certified trauma therapist. And i now have “working Dx of PTSD” listed. 

Current day: 
I do have episodes of derealization. I know what those feel like. But what i experienced yesterday was different- it literally felt like i was transported back to the SA event and it was happening again. And it happened while listening to a song. It didn’t last long but long enough for me to feel like shit today. 

Is this what a flashback can feel like and/or are like? Or am i just going crazy? Because i kinda feel like i am.

2025-10-27 20:22:08;long post. in need of support.;"i knew a person who had a drug and alcohol problem but who was also a narcissist. when we would talk, she would unironically make all things, ever, about her-
and that everything was designed just to make her feel bad.



unfortunately, today (on discord) i somehow ended up on the same server as that individual, and she was in a VC with three other people. when i joined, she was already threatening to kill herself (very loudly), so i stayed. however, it was all the same stuff, she hates her job, she has no money, she's so poor, her ex assaulted her, all her family members are dead, she has no mommy or daddy, she wants to kill herself, she goes outside and is jealous of people with family and she has no friends, over and over and over and over....




***i*** ended up being last to leave the VC (excluding her, the other three could not stand her anymore so they all left first) to try to be nice to her, the other three could not stand her anymore and left.





however, being exposed to her again for so long (i am clinically diagnosed with PTSD), sent me so extremely low. for example, when she would scream (*literally scream*) with her camera on that all her family is dead ""because of"" her *but at the same time* she says she ""never had"" a mommy or a daddy... well, that was and is still difficult because neither did i, unless you count the five narcissistic adults who abused me for the entire first eighteen years of my life. every single thing that she said threw a flashback at me, but i stayed, to still be there to support her, as she seemed to need support(?) and apparently could not (or would not?) try to calm herself.





i'll recover and i know that this set of feelings is temporary. but to hear someone *that severely unhinged*, who i even tried to be nice to for four whole hours, speak on issues that i also have but seeing how badly she deals with it, scares me, terrifies me that maybe i will become like her.





the thing i cannot stand now is how extremely needy she was presenting herself to be, and literally yelling her head off and (probably) on drugs. i have the same set of disadvantages as her, *the exact same* ones (familywise, vulnerabilitywise, economically, and even fearwise, just without all of the addictions) and i do not want to become like her but it is so terrifying. i have to find a way to deal with my circumstances but not become someone like that.

2025-10-27 12:22:17;I believe I’m blocking out horrific memories from my childhood.;"I’m 19F, and my memories typically come in flashes. I am aware of some CSA committed by my father, but again, those come in flashes.

All I have are a few flashes of memory, and the time frame I was living with him. From 4-11. I’m aware of the abuse happening every night because I told my friend at the time about it and have texts I don’t even remember sending. It was molestation.

But heres what I’m worried about.

My sisters are both victims of him as well, and my oldest sister explicitly says he raped her. My middle sister says she wasn’t down there often enough to receive much of the abuse, as it happened while we were sleeping, and she doesn’t remember being raped.

Other members of the family also sexually abused both of them. My cousins raped them, and I have no memories of interactions with these cousins, but I do have the memory of a feeling? A very disturbing, disgusted feeling is all I can remember.

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD and the symptoms are horrible. I’ll have horrible nightmares about being raped by old men, wake up from sleep and see naked creatures with male bodies standing around my bed, be going to sleep and feel hands on me, sleep paralysis that’s usually sexual hallucinations.

But neither of my sisters have these symptoms. I know different symptoms for different people, but I’m wondering why they’re so vivid and horrible, and why such a gap of time is missing in my memory.

I’m disturbed by the idea that something happened to me and I’m completely unaware, and it’s materializing itself as these monsters. I wanna know what the next step is, as i haven’t been seeing my therapist because of money concerns.";r/ptsd;4;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1oh573o/i_believe_im_blocking_out_horrific_memories_from/
2025-10-27 12:10:37;I Don't Understand Why I Have PTSD;"Before I start I want to give some disclaimers. 
⚠️ Talk of inappropriate touch, possible abuse, 🔫, and animal death ⚠️


Hello, my name is August, I am 18 and I was diagnosed with PTSD YEARS ago, like maybe around 12.
Anyways I genuinely don't know why I have it or whatever, I genuinely don't think I went through anything bad, hell I am starting to wonder if I just exaggerated things and that's why I got diagnosed or something like that. The things I went through are normal and I feel pathetic for having PTSD because of them.

First, when I was around the age of four, my mom met this guy on a dating app (I'll call him E"" and after a while we moved in with him. He was super nice and even had a really cool pet snake.
 I remember hearing my mom telling her friends how one day she came back to E all ticked off because I wet the bed. I haven't wet the bed in a long time and my mom knew that bed wetting could be a sign of S/A so she asked me about it and I told her nothing happened. I can't remember any of this btw.
A good bit after this my mom came home to E throwing our stuff into the fire and just full on going crazy (sorry I couldn't think of any better words). He broke and burned everything he could before mom stopped him and my mom and I had to escape to his cousins house.
At his cousin's I brought my puppy with me who I loved very much. We had her outside to go to the bathroom when he let her loose and I never seen her again, this still makes me sad.
Another thing I recently found out about is one day my mom came home to see this little (maybe 10 y/o?) with his hand on my panties. Not in them or anything but as soon as my mom walked in he got up and ran away. Again she asked me if anything happened and I said no. I again can not even remember this.
Another thing that happened was E chased my mom around with a 🔫... Fun times lol.

I would say around a month later mom and I were living with my grandma and great grandma when she met a new guy (I'll call him J) and started going out with him.
Like before he was super kind but this time after they got married, his true colors started to show. 
He was jealous of me and made no effort of hiding it. 
He had this chair in the living room and if he wasn't there I would sit in it. Well sometimes I would ask him for a minute so I could finish what I was doing because I was almost done and he would start yelling until he would just dump me out of the chair 
This was my fault, I should have just gotten up.
At this time I was also terrified of the bathroom so when I was in there I would leave the door open.
When J would get home he would shut the door and turn the light off (the light switch was on the outside of the bathroom) while shaking the door and is ould just scream and cry in the other side begging him to let me out.
He would also finish drinking his pop then throw him bottle on the ground and tell me to go throw it away. I would refuse and throw it back to him then he would throw it to me again and each time get louder until he would be standing up with his chest puffed out and yelling at me while I yelled back.
Later on my mom ended up stuck in the psych ward and I was unable to see her except for through this tiny window and that destroyed me. There is much more to say here but that would take up too much lol.
Another thing is I had this Turkey J promised me I could keep as a pet so I ended up getting really close to him. This turkey would follow me everywhere, come running when he heard me, wait for me to get off the bus after school, protect me, everything. He was my best friend. One day I got off the bus and started calling for him but he didn't come. I kept calling and calling thinking maybe he was just eating or something. Once I got closer to the house I saw a big pot by the garden surrounded in white feathers. As I walked over to the pot I kept telling myself, "" he would t, Jay wouldn't, no way he would."" Well he did, inside the pot was my best friend, I was later forced to eat him. 
I understand this is something a lot of people go through and it's completely normal but this is absolutely devastating to me.

There are many other things that happened that could have been what caused the diagnosis but I don't want to put to much here. I will say J never got violent, he would just act like he would hit you but never did. The most physical I remember him getting was when he pulled me by the back of my hood once. He was mostly just emotionally abusive.

What I wrote here is exactly how I remember things or how I was told them. I did not put my symptoms here as well because I simply do not feel like it.

I also have a bunch of stuff that has happened to me after my mom left that marriage but that's more recent stuff. ";r/ptsd;2;6;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1oh4zom/i_dont_understand_why_i_have_ptsd/

That thing is straight up torture, it makes u involentarily spazz out and the cuffs cut you up. I had to keep my hands off the floor for circulation but that made the cuffs dig into my wrists.

2025-10-26 05:32:13;Need Help Focusing School;"hi, im 19f, a student in local community college. i was diagnosed with C-PTSD this year, and I also have persistent depressive disorder. I’m really struggling with studying and my grades are falling because I’m unable to study. There are times when I try and make myself, and when I do I inhibit severe symptoms of anxiety, similarly to when I get triggered. I’m perfectly able to pertain materials in the classroom, but outside of them (hw and studying) I’m not able to.

I’ve identified with my therapist that I’ve suffered a lot of mental and physical trauma that involved studying when I was younger and is why studying is hard for me. 

i still live with my parents who are the ?cause of my cptsd, ive suffered physical and mental abuse from them although it’s stopped years ago. Since I live with them, I’m still actively getting triggered by them.

I’ve just started on Zoloft(SSRI) today, and so hopefully that will help but I really need it to start working soon because I need to genuinely be studying, and I have no idea how to do it because I carry so much anxiety over it.  It’s really weighing down on me because I need to maintain good grades because I want to go to transfer to a university. Is there any advice people can offer to me for studying who also struggles with something like this? ";r/ptsd;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1og39wf/need_help_focusing_school/

i’m sorry if this is too much to post here if it is let me know and i’ll take it down. i really don’t want to trigger anyone but I’m hoping to gain some clarity.

i was diagnosed with PTSD about 6 years ago when i started therapy for some childhood trauma stuff. 

6 years ago i attempted su*cide (hence why i started therapy). the gun i had used misfired and i got extremely lucky. 

for the past month or so, i have been having nightmares about my attempt and that has never happened before. i don’t understand why this is happening, and i don’t understand why it’s happening now. my nightmare will either be a play by play of my attempt, or one where the gun does fire and i can see my head explode which i hate a lot. i cant get it out of my head.

it’s been 6 years, and this has never happened before so honestly its also pissing me off. this is the right time of year (i attempted nov. 10) but im just not sure if this could be a PTSD thing? because these nightmares are really similar to the ones i would have with my other trauma.

does anyone else have a similar experience?";r/ptsd;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ofwpbu/confused_also_massive_tw_sucide_attempt/
2025-10-26 00:58:12;Avoidance and responsability;"Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this, suggestions and personal experiences are very welcome and will help me a lot.

Two weeks ago I came to the realization that I have PTSD (diagnosed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist) from the last 3 years in which a collection of continuous life wrecking events happened to me.

For the last year I have been hiding and avoiding every person involved in the mentioned events, which is eveyone in my life, except my boyfriend, whom I met afterwards. I don´t talk to family, friends, I ghosted my ex boss, I am terrified of my email or to find him on the street. I have been on sick leave since april and my doctor is already questioning why its taking me so long to get well. Every nigth I have nigthmares, flashbacks come to me randomly, cant mention people involved in the events without crying.

Since all of these started I have behaved terribly, I feel shame, remorse and I don´t identify with what I did, nor I want to repeat such behaviours. We are talking trying to get back to my work for a whole year, promising over and over that I will be back to normal, missing deadlines, not delivering, I was basically freeloading at work. My trauma is in part related to work so I have come to realize is that while I was trying to ""go back to normal"" I was making my situation worse, trying to force myself to face my trauma and blaming myself for not being able to. I didn´t understand, I thougth I was just not trying hard enough, so I overexplained, wrote one too many heart felt letters to my boss, exposed myself to his secretary making a fool of myself.

I used to work on research, I had a very good laptop which I kept while sick with the hope that I would just magically get better and go back to ""normal"". When my contract ended I was asked to give it back together with my keys, it took me almost two weeks to prepare it, I couldnt bring myself to deliver it in person so I sent it by DHL, I sent it in the original box, inside of a DHL box, it was less that ideal and I wanted to pack it properly before sending it, but I didn´t, it arrived and because I am mortified of my email I don´t know in which state. I am not a thieve, or an asshole. Yet my behaviour says something else.

I also have a lot of very expensive supplies that should be used before they expire, I have things I should take care of, but it seems so far from reality for me to go to the office, and the lab (couldn´t make myself go into the building since the events, despite trying my best.

People want to know I am fine, I have promised to send updates, but I haven´t, I am lonely and sad.

How do you deal with the guilt of avoidance? the shame of not fullfilling your responsabilities despite wanting to? The judgement of others? How do you trust yoursef again? How do I know I am not just making excuses for my poor behaviour? How do I take accountability and responsability if I can´t even open whatssapp?

I am intensively looking for therapy, and an outpatient program. I know I will improve, but now I know it won´t be all at once, or fast.

I could really use some advice, thanks again for reading!";r/ptsd;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ofwlih/avoidance_and_responsability/
2025-10-25 16:46:37;Anyone else triggered by things that didn’t even happen to them?;"I feel really stupid for this. To explain, I experienced online sextortion/grooming and blackmail as a preteen. It was very minor, only went on for a few weeks maybe. Years later, I got diagnosed with PTSD due to flashbacks and symptoms as a result of all that.

The sextortion/grooming part I don’t even want to call it sexual trauma since it wasn’t physical, nor do I even want to call it “sextortion” but my therapist calls it that so I will try to too. Despite how minor the incidents were, since I was like 12 or 13 it was very scary and I was stupidly traumatized by it due to the threats I was told in order to keep me quiet.

I began having nightmares of being sexually assaulted, but it was a rare occurrence, so I ignored it. But this year I began having almost constant nightmares of it again. Not of what actually happened to me, NEVER of anything I’ve experienced, but a full-on unprompted barrage of nightmares of being violently r*ped. It was relentless, sometimes multiple nightmares a night, for months.

They were different nightmares each time, no pattern. Sometimes it was strangers, sometimes it was family. Sometimes I woke up sore from how vividly I felt it, and sometimes I only remembered the lead up to the assault in my nightmare. The themes varied too. Sometimes it was broad daylight and in a public place, sometimes it was in a dark isolated room. Sometimes I even had nightmares of being tortured during the assault, or being violated during childbirth, but I’ve never even been pregnant, let alone experienced childbirth. I’ve never been sexually “hurt” in any way whatsoever beyond that initial trauma or whatever but even that was not physical in any way. So I was just as badly affected by the nightmares as I was by my initial trauma for some reason. Because of how new, violent, vivid, and unpredictable they were.
I even developed vaginismus for a while, during the worst of the nightmares, due to how terrified my mind and body became of any form of intimacy.

My therapist explained I was showing newer, worsening PTSD symptoms from my nightmares, which “isn’t unheard of” but she couldn’t help me much nor could she find any research or evidence on how to support what I was going through beyond referring me to a sexual trauma support center, which I’m waiting to hear back from. I feel so fucking stupid for it.

The nightmares tapered off after a while (thank god) when I began talking about my “sexual trauma” in therapy, since the sexual trauma was not something I’d talked about much or even processed in EDMR. Instead I’ve always focused on the more severe blackmail and following events in EMDR and trauma therapy. The sexual trauma felt like a side quest I hadn’t explored yet.

But even with the nightmares mostly gone, with the memories flooding back and as aftermath of the nightmares, I’m triggered by all things SA related. My roommate keeps talking about her dark romance book (reads it in public lots and says I “have to read it” because it’s “so good”) despite my protests and it makes me so mad. Any mention of SA puts me on edge in a way I’ve never felt before.

I now straight up fear most men, and worry they have bad intentions when they simply interact with me. I actually had a panic attack or two when a male coworker accidentally touched me this summer. I can’t do a certain sex position that I was often put into in my nightmares, and am embarrassingly vanilla. It nearly ruined my relationship from how bad it was. I would go weeks without sex and am no longer any fun in bed really. Not that I was to begin with though.

Why am I so scared of this stuff when I wasn’t even assaulted? Is this just repressed “sexual trauma” worsening because I refuse to accept it? If so, why did it almost destroy my life? How could I let nightmares ruin my life?

I feel like the only one in the world traumatized by nightmares. I feel so stupid for it. I know the nightmares wasn’t real. I know it’s not real. But it fucking sucked and changed my life almost as bad as when I was initially traumatized.

I just hope the trauma center is able to help me get over my fears. I’m so tired of living on edge and hating sex.";r/ptsd;8;4;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ofmm62/anyone_else_triggered_by_things_that_didnt_even/
2025-10-25 08:20:22;PTSD rage, and the fallout.;Years ago, I suffered some traumatic experiences one after the other. Genuine trauma. Diagnosed with PTSD. Around this time, I developed periods of rage that I could not control. I felt like someone else. During this time, I did some horribly violent things. I didn't harm any people, but the things I did were so heinous that to this day I cry myself to sleep over them. My family knew that these things happened, but they have no idea it was me. If I were to tell them, they would never look at me the same way again. It would ruin my wife and childrens' lives. I did discuss this with my trauma therapist. She said this was a common result of trauma, but it didn't make me feel better. She put me on some antipsychotic meds that were then being tested for use in dealing with traumatic experiences. Soon after I started this medication, the rage went away. It just vanished. My brain was healing, but now I could see clearly the things I had done. It was like someone else had done it, but I felt every bit of the excruciating agony for having done these things. I refuse to hurt anyone else ever. This has changed me in profound ways. But still, I have to live with these secrets. I am seriously considering deleting myself because it's what I deserve and I can't live with the knowledge of what I have done. Maybe God will forgive me, but even if he does, nothing will undo the damage I did. I feel so lost. Until my traumatic injuries, I was not that person. After treatment, I am not that person.

2025-10-25 00:27:29;Do I invite my abusive father to my wedding?;"My father has abused me since as far back as I can remember. I permanently moved to my mom’s place and didn’t speak to him for a long time. Possibly years, due to my diagnosis I’ve suffered from memory loss. Either way, a while back I let him into my life again but I’m always a little bit uncomfortable with him. We’ve never spoken about what he put me through, but he still gets very angry easily. This sense of discomfort never really leaves me when I’m with him even though I love him as my father. Everytime he comes around or calls me I automatically crawl back into a little shell. I feel like I can’t fully enjoy any situation when he’s there because of my trauma responses. I love my dad, but everytime I try to decline him coming around all the time or stay firm in my boundaries he genuinely tries to make me feel bad on purpose. 

My wedding is very important to me, and I want to be able to enjoy it fully.

2025-10-24 23:38:08;Does anyone else have or know someone with diagnosed PTSD/Anxiety disorders who has very vivid dreams or trauma and stress that are not like the big trauma event that happened to you?;"I just want to know if anyone else gets very vivid nightmares about things that may be stressful and from another past trauma or stressor, in which one wakes up and mentally and physically feels very anxious or fearful. This is new to me—having so many in one week. The big stressor is that my ESA dog has terminal cancer, but it is not new, and I am not able to sleep much, which can no longer be helped with medication. 

When I do sleep, I have some very vivid nightmares about things other than the specific event that caused PTSD, like childhood trauma or being unable to save the lives of others. When awake, I write the dream down, I do some calming breathing, but wake up with a panic attack oncoming, which ends up in taking a med and calming myself until it kicks in. I would rather not take it, asit  I usually only take three times a month.

My psychotherapist is out of town. Trazodone and antihistamines don't help with sleep anymore, and I have stopped them(It is ok with my MD, and I may be having rebound REM), so they don't help me stay asleep to forget the nightmares. 

Not much the M.D. can do anymore, as I talked to him yesterday.

A quick background: maybe TW for slight mention of SI- The last few months have been really difficult for me with having trauma symptoms come up. I very recently got a CPTSD diagnosis due to childhood abuse and have been having a lot of difficulty around borderline self injurious behaviors. Over the summer I completed an intensive outpatient program and the therapy I’m doing now is a continuation of the work I started in that program. TBH there has been significant growth but there’s still some behaviors I’m struggling with that are directly related to the trauma. I guess I just can’t figure out why I need permission to be nice to myself, or how to give this level of freedom to myself…";r/traumatoolbox;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1oek7w8/simple_solutions_arent_easy/

When I have an ""episode"" / remember something traumatic I usually slap myself as a way to bring me back into the moment, if I can't do that then I usually scream. It’s intense, and I’m really trying to manage it better.

At this point I don't think I can work in person anymore, its not healthy for me. I've been unemployed for about a year but I've been writing more and reading more. im also a college student studying psychology.

I want to make a job out of my writing capabilities but I do not know where to start, i've posted essays on websites such as medium / tiktok  and i've also done creative work on [Itch.io](http://Itch.io) which has earned me a total of around 50 USD so far.

has anyone else struggled as a young person with an inability to work in person, how did you survive?";r/ptsd;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1octk31/i_feel_unable_to_work_in_person/
2025-10-22 03:20:25;First Post - I need help wtf;"**I only used 1 tag (still pretty new to posting on reddit) but I’d tag: Advice & Support too.**

I am a 25F who went through a severe accident back in July. A 6 wheel truck crashed into my office nearly killing me. I have been on medical leave since. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD a while back and am due to go back to work next week. I have barely been sleeping and with the little I do I wake up with a headache from clenching my teeth so hard. I can’t focus and feel unmotivated to do almost anything I need to do in my life. 

I’m putting myself through school too & I’m barely keeping up with my classes. I’m just barely making it. 

I’m having issues with my personal injury lawyer. He’s not releasing any of my case information to me and I suspect he and his team are half-assing and not giving much attention to my case per some emails they sent me. 

My therapist cancelled on me this week b/c of some emergency. 

I have shit to do, but I’m feeling overwhelmed & unmotivated. I need some kind of support. I feel like I’m just wasting away. 

I know what I should be doing but I just can’t do it. I don’t have anyone in my life to support or help me. I feel very tired & alone.

2025-10-22 00:14:39;Triggered at the hairdresser and further struggles;"I can’t stop thinking about what happened at the hairdresser over three months ago. First, because he butchered my hair and I hate how I look, I have never worn my hair short, and it feels like he took away part of my identity or self-image, but also because of the way he treated me when I complained.

I had repeatedly emphasized that I wanted to grow my hair back to about chest length and expressed my strong dislike of short hair (I even showed him what was “too short” for me). He was supposed to trim only the bare minimum.

We agreed on two inches (he himself stated this number), which was already pushing my limit. Instead, about eight inches were cut off. The front sections ended up shorter than shoulder length when curly, which completely went against what he had assured me. In the end, my hair is now even shorter than it was six months ago, despite me telling him that I had been growing it out during that time and that I had hated the length I had then because it felt too short (which I also showed him). It will take almost two years for my hair to grow back, and about three to reach my desired length again. Even friends have noticed how unsuitable this haircut is for my age and hair type. I could cry every day when I look in the mirror, it is far too short, old-fashioned, and shapeless.

He did not ask me any questions (about my parting, desired shape, or how I style my hair, etc.), and even went out to talk on the phone during the haircut. He didn’t seem to listen to me and kept *mansplaining* things that are basic knowledge (like how much hair grows in a month or how to take care of curly hair — while spreading misinformation at the same time). He also didn’t show me how much he was cutting off, claiming: “You’ll hardly see a difference afterwards.”

I voiced my criticism in a personal conversation. The guy reacted just as others have described before in the comments — snappishly and without any understanding. He spoke in a very unfriendly tone and insisted it “had to be done this way.” He denied being able to tell from the photos I had taken before and after the haircut how much was cut off, saying it was impossible to judge because I have curly hair. My repeated references to how dissatisfied I was and to my well-known goal of growing my hair long were dismissed with flippant remarks like “You didn’t say when,” “Well, that’ll take a long time now,” or “So what am I supposed to do now?” When I said that my hair was shorter than it had ever been before, he claimed he couldn’t have known that, even though I had shown him during the haircut. When I said I felt uncomfortable with the short hair, he pointed to another customer with a buzz cut and said *that* was short, not mine. As I said, I had clearly told him what “short” means to me. When I pointed out that my hair wasn’t even shoulder length, he pulled my curls straight. He came too close to me and constantly interrupted me loudly and shouted at me even as I was nearly crying. And when I finaly run out of the salon he walked up behind me and I felt so unsafe.

His conclusion was that there had been no mistake, only a “communication problem.” I had relied on the agreed-upon two inches. If he had thought more needed to be cut, he should have said so beforehand, then I would have refused.

Afterwards, I again wrote them an email explaining how dissatisfied I was with my hair being short and how upset I was about his behavior. His brother and co-owner responded by also not admitting any failure but granting me a refund.

I went to this hairstylist because he claimed to know how to cut curly hair and was located near my university and workplace. That is also where I got chased two weeks ago by a middle aged antisemitic lady while I was talking at the phone with a fried after a lecture.

I am so upset about having had to deal with a guy who was abusive. I went through a horrible period in the past few years because of a very toxic and abusive boss at my university. Before that, I had to deal with sexual abuse. While I was at school, it was bullying, and my dad, even though I loved him, was sometimes hard to deal with and we had a complex relationship. And the worst part is that I am never able to leave in those situations. I should have walked out as soon as I realized that he was rude and not listening. I really do not know why I always get in those situations and I can not stop being sad about how short my hair is ( it is now shoulder length/ in some places a little longer) and being angry and horrified about this guy. I also feel imensly guilty for everything. Like not being able to get out of those situations and always getting in those situations. I should work on my thesis, which is in fact linked to my familys frauma and has a lot to do with my dad who died 10 years ago because I always feel like I have to fight his fights, and I hate myself for not being able to not think about it and all those tinks that happened at university. I survived a suicide attempt last year in July and I always act like I am over it but I realize how fragil I still am. And while I do theraphy I cant stop feeling horrible.

Edit: I should also say that I am diagnosed with cPTBS, recurrent depressive disorder and maybee a mild form of autism. 

So maybee somebody can relate or went through something similliar and has some advise.";r/ptsd;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1och8u8/triggered_at_the_hairdresser_and_further_struggles/
2025-10-21 22:12:28;How to move on when it just feels so heavy;"Hi all. I’m wondering how ya’ll continue to exist when everything just feels so heavy and living feels so incredibly daunting and impossible. I’m not suicidal. I don’t want to die. However I often feel like I just kinda exist. While it is possible to feel joy those feelings are not sustained and the amount of effort it takes to independently do things that bring me joy is immense. To top this off I have level 2 autism that was not diagnosed until I was 39, I had no supports, and I am in deep progressive, burnout. 

The thing is the world does not stop and despite the decades of self advocacy I’ve undertaken to just been seen the amount of help offered pales in comparison to the help I need. Given that I have clinically defined significant support needs that were never recognized or accommodated, and if anything weaponized against me, I also struggle to understand what is burnout, what is an unmet need, what is avoidance, and what is learned helplessness. 

I’m just so exhausted and feel like a zombie going through the motions most days, completely overwhelmed with just existing and the basic activities of adulthood, which even though I qualified for supports through the country board of DD, it still seems I have to do most of the legwork to put these supports in place.

2025-10-21 11:05:24;Dream terror a decade later?;"I escaped an abusive relationship 13 years ago. I experienced many traumas and damaging things during the ~2 years I was with this man. There was a break and escape but no closure. For a few years after there was some contact.

I have had recurring nightmares with them in it since. I feel utter terror in these dreams. I’m tied down to them or in my current life but with them. I’ve evolved in these dreams from being helpless to being able to yell and say how I feel and it’s not real. Recently I’ve been able to remember I have my life and my lovely husband during the dreams.

I have talked to multiple therapists about them. One gave me a ptsd diagnosis. Maybe stress aids in the happening. 
I just wish they’d go away. It’s like one piece will not let go and let me free. 

Anyone else have a similar experience and any tips on elevating them?

Usually it's just numbness sometimes it causes depression and isolation. I just moved recently and have had a lot going on mentally the past few months so I feel like things have gotten worse and more frequent as far as having intrusive memories and hours of just sitting and mulling over things.

I contacted the RAINN hotline again and they helped a little bit. I'm just not sure what to do I guess... it's not like what I'm dealing with is that bad, right?

2025-10-20 06:55:29;Fear and anxiety about leaving a Trauma/ PTSD outpatient treatment program;"Hello all - I am leaving an outpatient treatment program that I have been in for about 6 weeks tomorrow. To be very frank, I don't feel that I'm ready. I don't know quite what happened - my moods have been all over the place as I have been doing some quite difficult exposures (some have gone quite well, others, particularly recently, have been emotionally huge.) In a bit of a panic, I emailed the program late on Friday to say ""Can we please extend this for at least a week,"" but with my discharge date already set for Monday, I don't know if they can change this so late in the game.

I know that I've grown very used to the routine (I have been in this program for 6 weeks, and I have been out on leave from my job during this time.) While my panic attacks are under control, my depression / mood swings have been much more pronounced; particularly the dark moods have dipped very low and this has scared me quite a bit. I know that while you're doing exposures, you can't really over-medicate yourself because you've got to feel your way through all this, but I really worry about where I am somedays. I haven't been this depressed in many years.

I understand that this sub isn't a place for diagnosis, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced jitters as they leave a PTSD program - what was it like having unstructured time after you left? Were you scared of this? Did you make it through OK till you started working with your therapist after the program (I am seeing her on Thursday this coming week.)? Did you worry that you had to go back into your program?

I appreciate any thoughts on this. I should also add for some context that I am something of an over-achiever (this is probably in response / in an attempt to bury my particular trauma) and that stripping back some of my responsibilities has, in itself, been like being emotional naked and scary. Having time alone to myself for a few weeks is also scary to me as well.

2025-10-17 13:08:22;I think my dad is genuinely affecting me really bad now please help;"I genuinely think the things my dad has been doing is impacting me really bad and idk what to do please read

I’ve recently been diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and as a result of school starting I’m failing all my classes because my focus is extremely bad.

My dad doesn’t know how to go about this, he refuses to acknowledge the actual problem at hand, doesn’t try to help or understand me, and blame my ADHD on technology (I have a theory that he uses technology as an excuse to justify his shitty parenting because before I was diagnosed, and still currently because I haven’t found coping mechanisms, was significantly depressed for years because I didn’t understand what was wrong with me and didn’t receive help I needed.)

But to address the point, my dad has been primarily verbally and emotionally abusive and at times physically and/or sexually abusive (but I’m not sure if certain details count involving SA.) 

His constant criticism and verbal abuse towards me, and the manipulative and narcissistic grasp he has on my mentally ill and traumatized mother makes things ten times worse for me. I came to the realization that a lot of her decisions are dictated by my father.

I’m 15 and my stress has only increased, I’ve debated whether or not to get emancipated, and now that my mental health is getting worse i feel like I get more paranoid around him. I’ve noticed this a lot but I often hear my dad’s voice when I’m wearing headphones or something in this tone he usually has (it’s always when he’s upset) and it makes me anxious just to realize he’s not even there. Other times he’ll walk into a room and I tense up, just waiting for him to spew his harmful rhetoric at me or yell at me or just do something.

The ironic thing is, I know my dad was worse during my early childhood (0- about 11 I’d say) 
But I’ve blocked most of that out, I don’t think I was as terrified of my dad then because I was to young to understand the effect it had on me and he’d often love bomb me, but now it’s getting to a point where I’m realizing he literally has fucked with every aspect of my life. 

There’s been times past and recent, where I’ve expressed the urge to SH or worse and he’d belittle me or even encourage it. I can’t be around it anymore and I feel like I need to listen to my body before it’s to late, because idk why I’m just always tense now.

2025-10-17 03:39:24;Was I misdiagnosed?;"22nb/trans man, diagnosed autism & adhd, undiagnosed ocd but my therapist is certain I have it.

When I was 18 I went to see a psychiatrist during a very rough spell of my life. I had just dropped out of college because of some false accusations which resulted in me losing many friends and basically having a breakdown. It was summer and all I wanted to do was lay in bed and hurt myself. I was also harassed by a transphobic street gang who attacked me. I refused to tolerate their crap so I swore at them, then I was attacked. I’ve always been a highly anxious person but these events sent me down a spiral of paranoia and terror. The psychiatrist I went to around this time said I was dealing with CPTSD and made a diagnosis. I don’t know how legit this was.

My parents have always been amazing and I don’t have any real trauma from them. Sure me and my mum would argue and I would push her buttons until she lost her temper then she would go silent on me for the rest of the day. She would never hit me or anything. I did get a few spankings from grandma but there’s nothing else. My mum got mad at me sometimes because I was a difficult neurodivergent child which I cant fault her for. I made a lot of mistakes, some very bad ones that I still torture myself for. I also had oppositional defiance disorder (ODD) which meant I was the “naughty kid.” I was punished a lot at school but I understand because I was unbearable to deal with. I annoyed other children out of boredom.

Nowadays, I have a group of amazing friends but mentally im still not out of the woods. I still hate myself for all the mistakes I’ve made and I can’t seem to like myself no matter what. I feel like my family and friends don’t really love me, no matter how much they shower me with love. No matter how many cuddles I get from my parents, I feel like they’re acting. I feel fake too. I look in the mirror and see a disgusting freak who should be locked up, even though I’ve changed for real and my past mistakes make me want to die. 

Earlier this year, one of my closest friends sexually assaulted me but it took me 6 months to cut him off. I felt like I deserved the assault and I deserved to hang around with trashy people like him. My friends say he raped me but I find it so hard to call it that, even though it technically WAS rape. I feel like I got what i deserved but it’s still not enough. Sometimes the intrusive thoughts about my past, the fuckups i made, who I used to be etc are so unbearable that i feel like I can’t go on. Even though I’ve changed, I feel like it doesn’t matter. That disgusting child still lives rent free in my head 24/7. And the friend who hurt me also lives in my head, I feel like I AM him sometimes. 

I’m wondering if I was misdiagnosed with CPTSD because I don’t have enough actual trauma. Most of the “trauma” is stuff I literally caused. The reason I was disliked in school was because I was insufferable. Maybe I didn’t know how BAD I was being then, but i should have fucking known. I think im overreacting about every bad thing iv been through ";r/ptsd;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o8g0yb/was_i_misdiagnosed/

Right before the pandemic I was sexually assaulted by a hinge date. I haven’t been to see my primary doctor since then which was at this point 5/6 years ago. I had an appointment last February and 5 minutes before they called and canceled due to the doctor having to pick up her sick child from daycare. I get it shit happens but UGH.

2025-10-14 08:47:29;How do you discuss intimacy with your partner??;"I got diagnosed with PTSD a couple of months ago (even though I had been struggling for years, just didn’t have health insurance. One of the two traumatic experiences I’ve had was being SA’d by a family member (paternal grandfather) between the ages 5-8. My brain had actually almost completely suppressed the memory until someone mentioned it about 10 years ago, and it all hit me like a truck and have been dealing with flashbacks and other emotional issues ever since. 

For the past 5 years I’ve been with my wonderful partner, and I’ve been open with him about my past and he’s been very supportive. However, I feel like one big issue I’ve personally always had is intimacy in relationships. I almost never want to have sex, and 9/10 I feel disgusting or ‘dirty.’ He’s always known that I have a low libido and has been ok with it. However he recently admitted to me during an argument that he feels like we haven’t been having a lot of sex lately, and he told me that whenever he asks for more sex, it’s because he wants to feel more love. Admittedly it’s been a very stressful month for the both of us - moved cities, he got a new job and I left mine, and my mother is currently dying (which in a way its connected to my other traumatic experience but that’s a whole other story). He said after that he hasn’t brought it up because I have a lot of other things going on, and he admitted it was not a big deal compared to everything else going on. 

My question is this - if anyone has been through something similar, how have you discussed intimacy needs with your partner? Is there anything that yall have done that has helped the anxiety around bedroom intimacy? I’m desperate at this point for some suggestions because I don’t like feeling this way and it’s making me feel like I’m inadequate. My ex also made me feel like I wasn’t putting out enough and it caused a lot of strain on that relationship, so I want to make sure that this doesn’t get in the way of an otherwise great relationship.

2025-10-14 05:42:21;Broke up with my Gf;Honestly I’m gonna be all over the place when writing this, but right now I’m wondering if I made the right decision, For the past 3 years I’ve met this girl. We’ll call her Amanda and at first everything was great she had that energy of someone who would let me be myself. And there genuinely wasn’t a problem. Now prior to dating her I already knew she had problems with family in particular especially with her mother. I won’t go through all of it but essentially we had a mother who had bpd which wasn’t diagnosed atleast at the time and a father was really wasn’t ever there or supportive. It really had a lasting effect on her as when I would noticed she really wasn’t loved properly as some idea of love with me seem foreign to her. She had trouble showing compassion and we would constantly get into problems certain expectations not being met and just overall confusion from how I’ve seen it, I decided to look into it and originally I thought maybe she inherited bpd from her mother as she did have many symptoms related to that, eventually I talked to her about it and she agreed to get evaluated and it turns out to be ptsd which would explain a lot as sometimes I would trigger without realizing it. Eventually figuring it out but at that point atleast for me, it felt like I was just drained and I have been always feeling like I’ve been punished for trying by doing it in the wrong way or even just not doing anything at all. She would constantly tell me that we weren’t going to be happy doing this. And that it’s all her fault. Obviously I kept trying to be understanding and listen as best I could. But I reached my boiling point, not towards having to deal with it like I hated but just I really think I can’t help her the way she would want me to, having to deal with her crying everyday just really made me feel like its my fault. So as of yesterday I ended it rather sourly. I understand there’s a lot of missing context probably but I will answer for questions. Right at this moment I’m unsure if it really was just me being not as good to her as I think.;r/ptsd;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o5x7mi/broke_up_with_my_gf/

2025-10-13 21:59:39;Trying to process abusive childhood;"TW: abuse, violence, ableism

I was diagnosed with autism when I was 4-5. My parents never accepted it and were convinced I was a broken, defective, fucked up kid. My dad wanted to “fix” the autism with violent regular beatings, verbal abuse and degradation, threats to send me to foster care and to the psych ward. He dragged me by the hair on the floor, choked me, destroyed my belongings in rage. My dad thought that all of that would “fix” the autism and make me “normal”.

This went on until I fled home at 19 terrified for my life. I was prepared to sleep on the streets and die there - that was preferable to going back to my dad. I then saw a bunch of therapists and they told me I had abusive parents who severely traumatized me and that I was probably not autistic.

I cut contact with my parents a year later. Upon informing him that I was cutting contact, he stalked me, trespassed on my property at midnight multiple times, called the cops on me two times saying I was suicidal (I was not), left super threatening voicemails on my phone about my dad insisted that I was “mentally ill” for wanting to cut my parents out of my life, that he did “nothing wrong” (lol) and that once I “calmed down” from my “autistic episode” we could talk “properly”. he also said that he would go find my therapist at the time and show her “documentation” about how I was “mentally fucked up and broken autist” and that my parents were only trying to do the best they could for me to “fix” me. he also said that I was not allowed to cut him off because I was his daughter and that I couldn’t do that.

I had to move to stop this harassment and stalking and block my parents everywhere.

I have been in therapy for dépression, complex PTSD for several years now. I am working on the insecurity and deep shame that my dad instilled in me that I was fundamentally broken. I ought to believe I am enough already to love, that other people in my life now love me as I am.

I am trying to undo all the damage from my dad who told me my whole life about how unloveable I was, how much of a horrible person I was, that no one would ever want to be friends with me or date me, how I was ugly and fat and repulsive, how I was at the bottom of the hierarchy of human beings and how I was so worthless that if I got r*ped I 100% deserved it & it would be my fault & that if it weren’t for him, I’d be a homeless crackhead who would not even graduate elementary school.

I am writing here because it is very difficult and I was hoping to find people who went through similar experiences who might understand. Thanks for reading.";r/ptsd;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o5khd9/trying_to_process_abusive_childhood/
2025-10-13 09:04:27;trauma is making me transphobic (help);"Hi guys I came to this subreddit because i need help working through/fixing this problem i’ve noticed.

basically i think my trauma is making me transphobic.

To give some context, i have clinically diagnosed ptsd. I suffer from panic attacks, nightmares, constant anxiety, depression, and an extreme distrust of men. My illness comes from the physical and mental abuse i endured when I lived with my father, but my distrust of men comes from that, combined with terrible experiences from people i thought were my friends. Just overall i have trust issues with men. 

I can give myself some slack when it comes to that aspect of my ptsd, though i really hate it, but my issue comes with my distrust of trans women and some cis women. 

I understand my distrust with trans men, they are men, but for some reason subconsciously i don’t trust trans women either. I think this is due to the association (like a trans woman used to be a man = man= danger) but that is awful. Trans women are woman and I hate that i have this transphobia towards them when they’re not men. I’ve also noticed i have the same distrust when it comes to cis women who have only male friends or women who grew up with brothers but that doesn’t justify my transphobia.

I just really hate that i am one of the people in the world that perpetuate this kind of hate on women who already go through enough. Do you guys have any advice? I want to fix this.

note: i am a cis woman that’s queer ";r/ptsd;21;38;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o563bx/trauma_is_making_me_transphobic_help/

Could this count as 'nightmares about the event'? Or does it have to be specifically nightamres about what I went through and with whom? Sorry if this is a silly question - I am autistic and I often interpret things like this very literally.

For most of my life after that I never really thought of it as trauma because nothing felt wrong like I wasn’t getting flashbacks or anything all it really did was make me sensitive to people raising their voices and making me jump everytime I hear a door slam or a loud noise but I’m just assuming that everyone reacts that way, one time I was arguing with my mom and then she brought it up and worded it in a way that made me kinda rethink how it made me feel. I’m assuming that I didn’t have any trauma from it I do remember it being very stressful and not a great environment but my family have always cared and took good care of me and it’s not like I don’t talk to my dad I think I’m just overthinking this and I’m fine but I would love to hear some other opinions once again I’m not looking to hear any diagnosis just others opinions and maybe similar storys

2025-10-11 06:33:20;Hi, I'm new here 👋🏻;"Hi everyone,

I want to start by saying I'm not diagnosed with PTSD (yet) but I was hoping to just get some nonjudgmental advice.

  
Recently, I've been trying to process a lot of childhood trauma that I suppressed for many years. I don't want to go into a lot of detail but there was alcoholism, domestic violence, cops at our house constantly. I ran away from home a lot growing up to a friend's house who would always give me a place to stay when things got bad.

  
When I graduated high school, I went straight into college and just did pretty much anything I could do to avoid being home or going home. I know I sought therapy for it at one point in college but I stopped pursuing it because they wanted me to come three times a week and at that point I was so stressed with classes I wanted to prioritize my education because being able to escape my home life seemed more important than anything, even treating the mental health impacts I may have been experiencing.

What happened next I can only describe as dissociating. I pretty much dismissed what happened and told myself it was over and that if it was truly bad enough, someone would have intervened. I convinced myself I was blowing it out of proportion and I think there was some gaslighting from my parents that may have contributed to that happening. But I basically moved out and actively avoided thinking about it or even returning to the town or area where all of it happened (my childhood home).

  
I'm now 36 so I've been suppressing all of this for well over two decades at this point. Earlier this year, I went to see a former teacher from high school I always had a close relationship with. I always felt like she watched over me in high school. I also suspect she suspected something was wrong because she would ask me about my home life a lot although nothing ever came of it.

When I went to visit her, she said that she was ""so worried about me"" after I graduated and came to find out that there were MANY teachers worried about me the entire time I was in high school. She said they were very concerned about my home life but never had solid evidence to report anything. She said they were concerned about what would happen to me after graduating and that she was thankful that I was okay.

I know that comment was well-intentioned and I care for this former teacher deeply but I feel like it triggered something. I started to realize I'm not really fine at all. I started to experience moments where I would just THINK about the past and I would be on verge of a mental breakdown in tears. I also started to realize I have large GAPS in my memory where I can remember certain events and things being bad but I can't remember major details.

I've started trying to get help from my doctor and I'm currently on a waitlist with for a therapist my doctor thinks might be able to help me but until then, I've been using AI and sharing some of my feelings and experiences with it.

The AI seems to think I may want to talk to my doctor to see if I have any form of PTSD. This seems weird to me because I've always thought of PTSD as flashbacks but after doing some reading, I'm starting to learn there's more to it.

I know no one here can diagnose me but I was wondering if anyone thinks this might sound like it? If so, do you have suggestions or advice about talking to my doctor about this and what my next steps would be?";r/ptsd;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o3f63l/hi_im_new_here/
2025-10-11 02:02:11;Cluelessly new to the ptsd diagnosis - how did you respond?;"As title says, I have just recently been diagnosed with PTSD. Didnt see it coming.

My backstory as quickly as possible: My exwife in an attempt to gain custody of our children accused me of raping her. Got arrested at work in an very public way that got plastered all over the news. Shortly after getting released on bond, she accused me of another rape, but this time for raping my oldest daughter.  Lost everything. Job, friends, community and even family. Final friends left me after the second accusation. Ended up finding out that after another 4 months the ex wife had my second daughter go in and accuse me of rape. Let me be clear - I have never done anything sexual in front of my children othe than kissing my partner, and in no way have I done anything sexual with them. I hate that I always have to defend myself in this as I know that many guilty men are accused of such things. But I am not one of them. I have simply had my life destroyed out of spite of an ex. The first accusation went through the full trial taking just shy of 2 years. Jury (female heavy) found me innocent within 2 minutes. The state dropped the second set, and never had charges pressed for the third (Id wager that they were waiting to see how the first went to see if they would bring up the third). I gained my life back in early 2024. But then a couple months ago the ex brought up new charges against me in which I got investigated again, and has sent me spiraling. the new charges have already been dropped, but I am a mess. Simple things like coming home, I wonder if I’m going to see an officer at my door or a note plastered to it. and then being ashamed of my name and going into defense mode when someone says actual full last name. 

I suffered my first full blown anxiety attack at work on Wednesday. i returned today, and have been happy that its been simple. I do have some support, including an amazing fiance. Ultimately, I feel lost. And I hate feeling broken. I still want to be the amazing dad I’ve always been, but with every one of these acccusations I lose access to my kids and have to fight to get them back. I started the fight to have full custody of my kids as the ex is not fit to be a full time mother (even her own sister and family have distanced themselves from her in an otherwise really tight family). But now I question my own ability to be a full time father with the anxiety attacks and PTSD diagnosis. 

How did you begin your process of finding a healthier you? I need to find something that works for me, and I would love to hear as many ideas as possible. Thanks in advance. ";r/ptsd;14;8;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o387kx/cluelessly_new_to_the_ptsd_diagnosis_how_did_you/
2025-10-10 19:12:50;Still Haunted by Past Abuse – Looking for Guidance T.T;"Hi everyone

I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with PTSD after leaving an abusive relationship, and I’m hoping to hear advice from those who have experienced something similar. 

My ex-partner and I broke up over five months ago. The main reason was his anger and violent behavior. I grew up in a violent household, where my parents constantly fought, and my father often hit my mother. I’ve always had a deep dislike for domestic violence, but being in a relationship with someone who became violent brought back. During our relationship, he was physically abusive several times, usually when both of us were emotionally upset. These included slapping me multiple times, covering my mouth and pulling my ears in public (someone even called the police), and hitting my head and neck. Even after a previous incident where he had been detained, this behavior continued and ultimately led to our breakup. Even in calmer moments, there were occasional minor behaviors between us, like light shoves or kicks. At the time, I thought these might just be emotional reactions.

Now that we are separated, I find myself extremely sensitive whenever domestic violence is mentioned, whether at work or in daily life. Just thinking about someone I once loved, raising their fist at me brings intense pain. Although I no longer feel hatred toward my ex and my life has been more peaceful since leaving him, I still feel fear about entering new intimate relationships and often find myself subconsciously avoiding closeness.

Since the breakup, I’ve tried to take positive steps: keeping busy with studying, applying for volunteering for domestic violence support, joining trauma programs, and reading books on PTSD and learning coping strategies. Despite this, I still feel unsafe, unhealed. I would deeply appreciate any advice, coping techniques, or resources from others who have been through a similar experience. 

P.S. I am a diagnosed PTSD patient, but due to financial reasons, I haven’t been able to receive further professional psychological treatment yet.

TRIGGER WARNING: workplace violence and SA (I don’t describe that in depth at all just discuss it) please don't read if that would be triggering for you in any way <3

After my experience of SA I had the classic behaviour of jumping from one relationship to the next, none lasting more than 3 or 6 months. I went to therapy and was celibate for a while, and after that I met an ex boyfriend that was the only person I felt genuine love for. I could see our future together so clearly and I really was so genuine when I told him that I loved him. There were some red flags but also green ones. we were best friends and his family who we lived with and others who saw us together when he was normal thought we were great together, the best of besties. but we didn't have many friends and when one of us was sad the other would mirror that emotion perfectly. I remember feeling isolated when I was with him. He wanted me to learn to snowboard because he was obsessed with it but he was so mean to me when I tried saying things like ""why are you so bad at this?"" ""I learned so much faster than you"" and all of that. Idk if it came form insecurities or what but I didn't enjoy doing sports with him because of that. I also fell deeply in love with him before even touching him, so deep that when we kissed and I felt nothing I still thought about him every day and eventually dated him. But I told him I didn't want to have sex all the time and I didn't really feel a spark but that I wanted to work on it. I think it made him jealous and insecure maybe which I feel bad about kind of but also that's his problem I guess. I was always loyal to him and if a male friend of mine made him insecure I made sure to hold his hand or spend less time with that guy to make him feel better. When I went abroad to work we were not good at long distance. He constantly wanted to talk and I was so busy. If I missed a text he would freak out. But still I loved him. He came to visit and I told him he didn't want to sleep with him then and he kept pushing so I did and it was the worst because I just wanted it to be over. Even on my birthday he did that same thing again only this time we didn't sleep together. We had a great time as friends, exploring and we travel well together. But I think esp because I was a victim of SA and he new that it really hurt me. My work place was so demanding and abusive, I think I needed safety and thought he would be that but he wasn't. I couldn't handle him constantly getting mad at me for not replying immediately and I cried often because of how difficult, soul-sucking, and abusive my workplace was. So I broke up with him. (we had been together for 6 months, known each other for about a year) not because I didn't love him but I wanted him to take care of himself and I didn't want him to rely on me for that because I wasn't able. I relapsed about 4 months later to talk to him again and it was really cathartic because we understand each others inner darkness I think. But then I had to escape my work and they caught me escaping. they extorted me for money by taking my passport and physically assaulted me. I shut down all emotions in those moments and I haven't felt anything there since (this was 3 years ago).

I finally escaped and came back to the states. I relapsed again and called this ex and he was supportive and really wanted me to come back with him. I thought that everything would be solved if I did that. But then I met this really sweet, kind, intelligent, and stable boy who immediately told me he wanted to be with me. I felt so selfish but the stabilty was like a magnet. I told this new boy about my ex and my traumas and he didn't care, he said the choice was mine and he wouldn't force me but he can see us being everything together. I had an awful phone call with my ex where I just pulled the plug on seeing him and I did it with so little feeling despite loving him. It felt like I was a robot who just had to complete a task. I didn't consider meeting halfway or anything because I was afraid the minute I saw him I would go back and I didn't really want to be away from my support system and somewhere I dind't have any friends. I accidentally went on quora and saw the signs of a narcissits and I believed that I was one because why else would I behave this way? I told my ex this and he has never spoken to me since. This solidified in my head that I must be one and that he was saving himself from my manipulation by leaving. I went to three different therapists to get a diagnosis of NPD but none would give it, they all said I probably had PTSD. I couldn't muster the self-compassion to believe that.

At the same time things just kept progressing with my new boyfriend. I felt evil and like I was using him, but everything about him was so good. He had friends and invited me to meet them, he met my family, he taught me how to do all his hobbies and learned mine. We had a house together and he bought a house we moved in to together. We are best friends. The only scary thing is that I have never felt that love for him. I feel evil saying it. We have been together for three years now and want to get married and I want to feel normal but I started having panic attacks when things got very serious. I told him my evil thoughts and demons and he told me he doesn't htink based on how I treat him that I don't love him. that I can talk to my ex if it helps to get closure. I have started going to EMDR to try to feel again, especially in my heart-space because it is so numb and impenetrable. I get panic attacks when I tell people and they say if I don't love him that's really not great, but I want to believe that its my heart blocking it and that it isn't impossible. I wonder if healthy people say I should leave because they have never had CPTSD block their ability to feel the way I have. Anyways. He is the kindest person I have known and I just want to hear some other people's perspective who have CPTSD. I know that loving can be hard with this and it is so easy to feel numb. EMDR has helped already with me feeling more but my heart is resisting the EMDR so much. My biggest fear is if I call my ex I will still be in love with him and I will jeapordize everything I have built in my new life and hurt the person I care for the most right now.

I wish I was normal and could love normally. Anyways please if you could be gentle with your comments but also thank you so much in advance if you have any insight.";r/ptsd;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o1ltda/is_it_possible_to_feel_love_again/
2025-10-08 18:09:19;My mom is being disrespectful and it’s driving me insane. I have no choice but to live with her right now but I’m ready to pull out my hair by the handful. Help!;"I need advice on how to live peacefully with my partially unsupportive mother while I have no option but to live with her right now. For reference I just got home from a traumatic experience being treated poorly by nurses at the psych ward I was just staying in (was there from like September 17 to 26). I should preface by saying my mom doesn’t WANT me to have mental health issues but she’s not handling it in a way that’s helpful to me. I have PTSD (potentially CPTSD, I’m gonna ask my psychiatrist about it tomorrow), bipolar 1, BPD, and I suspect I have autism (and have been living as if I know I have autism for simplicity’s sake—I’m almost certain I’m autistic but can’t afford the appointment for a diagnosis). I say “partially” cause I know she means well as far as I’m aware but I still don’t agree with the way she’s handing things. 

My mom has been driving me nuts but I have no choice but to live with her while I figure out my difficult financial situation (and I have arrangements to move in with my bestie but that won’t happen for years as I’m not even approved for disability yet and I can’t move in until bestie’s dad no longer lives there either due to death or moving into a veteran’s home when he’s older) 

She has not been very supportive regarding the trauma I faced in the hospital and my trauma symptoms such as forgetting things easily and being easily enraged (I truly believe it’s related to PTSD even tho it won’t be confirmed by a doctor til tomorrow) and she made a snarky comment earlier today about how I SHOULD be able to listen to what she’s saying while I’m multitasking on something else (even though I’ve had clear auditory processing issues my whole life due to this suspected autism). To make matters worse she just really gets on my nerves at home talking about politics constantly and she recently told me her plans of keeping the $10 she owed me but not until *I* ended up saying to her she can keep the $10 for providing rides to me while I’m not comfortable driving at the moment (she decided on her own she was keeping the money without promptly telling me her decision and it makes me feel like she intentionally neglected to tell me hoping I’d never ask). 

So what can I do to keep my sanity without constantly relying on hanging out at my bestie’s house or isolating myself in my room to avoid my mom? I don’t wanna push her away but she’s starting to give me no other choice. How can I keep my sanity and retain my relationship with my mom without snapping? My therapist suggested keeping stress balls handy wherever I interact with my mom and also writing down my thoughts when I feel like snapping and then throwing the paper away. Which is a great start but I wonder if there’s other things I could do to improve the effects of my efforts. I want to be able to set boundaries and let her know the extent to which she’s hurting me (it triggers my suicidal feelings and I thought I had resolved this shit in the hospital already but guess not). 

I should add that she’s the type to take any criticism personally and she often storms away in a huff even when I’m trying to be open and honest about my feelings. So I feel like any boundaries set will not be well received.

Edit: I should also add that I had PTSD diagnosed already after an unrelated traumatic experience that has nothing to do with nurses or hospitals. And the symptoms I’m having from the nurse experience are much worse than the PTSD symptoms I dealt with after the previous traumatic event. So I’m pretty damn sure I was retraumatized.

2025-10-08 17:57:53;literally just got diagnosed;"!!TW: mentions of childhood SA!!

hi everyone!
as the title says, i literally just got diagnosed with ptsd yesterday afternoon. i’m having a really hard time wrapping my head around everything.
for context, i was assaulted at around 7 or 8 years old. not to get too into details, but i was locked in a closet with a kid a few years older than me and he sexually assaulted me. i barely remember the incident, just that i was scared and trapped. i think i subconsciously pushed it away, because i was young and didn’t know how to deal with it. 
years later when i tried to tell people i wasn’t met with very good reactions, and there really was nothing to do about it. i didn’t think it affected me much all throughout my childhood and teens. but just recently on public transportation, i had a man creep on me really hard and pull my hair asking me if i liked it and all those gross things. it was a full bus, nobody did anything and he eventually followed me off. nothing came of it but i just completely frozen and didn’t know what to do. it was like i was transported back to me being a kid and i was trapped in that closet again. 
i’m 20 now, i thought i was being dramatic and that i should just get over it. but apparently not. 
i downplayed being assaulted for so long and now i can’t stop remembering bits and pieces. i keep flashing back to it and i feel so dumb because it happened so long ago. talking to this therapist, i realized a lot of my issues stem from my assault. it feels like it’s a part of me, like i don’t know how to exist without it because it happened at such a young age. i feel like most of my mental health issues and just reactions to things are trauma responses. but i didn’t even know. i thought i was being dramatic and faking it. i don’t know what to do. i’m so overwhelmed. it feels weird to have a reason for all my weird freak outs and dreams and quirks. i wish i could ignore it, but i cant. 
i’m not sure why i’m posting here but i think i just needed to vent. 

any advice for someone newly diagnosed and very overwhelmed by it?

I wasn’t performing well at work and eventually was on FMLA for 5 weeks doing intensive program with my psychologist. She recommended I have a service animal when I went back to work. 

I trained and am still training my dog. Did not get a puppy. I am on a 60 day trial at work with her and am honestly feeling very anxious about the whole situation. This is my first day with her at work and she’s doing really well. I’m just curious if anyone else has a service dog and what it was like transitioning with them to the workplace.

2025-10-08 02:44:42;Newly Diagnosed;I went in for an autism assessment last week. I scored highest in categories of autism and then in PTSD (as well as a history matching for both), anxiety straggling not far behind. They told me that because of my levels of trauma that they felt they couldn't diagnose me with autism, that if I work on healing then I will become less autistic. Being self diagnosed as autistic for the last few years has really helped me, so it is an adjustment to consider how much of my personality is PTSD. I also have been no contact with my parents for nearly 2 years, but have been trying to build a relationship with them. They are my abusers and the source of my trauma, however, and now I don't know if I should tell them about my diagnosis or if I should continue to try and heal with them in my life, or if I should bite the bullet and choose the NC life. I'm only 23, the world feels impossible without a family and parents to guide me, but it's not like they were much anyways I guess. I thought my childhood was messed up but never thought that it was too terrible, but now I feel like I have a whole different perspective on my whole life. Advice for anyone that is/was self diagnosed autistic or just advice for folks who were newly diagnosed and not entirely expecting it would be appreciated.

2025-10-07 21:08:33;Addiction and Substance Abuse Of Mother;"I am 26 years old. I just found out, that my mother was working in a Bar while she was pregnant with me and used Cocaine and Alcohol. I already knew it, but not that she was doing it in such vast amounts and without hesitation.

I have severe problems with emotional regulation, got diagnosed with ADHD and am struggling with addiction and substance abuse in general. I feel deeply sad about knowing what she was doing and am in immense shame. I feel betrayed, sad and used. My whole life I was struggling with my emotions and can not be in tune with myself. I am almost always in fear, I was abusing cocaine, alcohol and weed.

I am living in an extreme, since I can not do anything the normal way. I am searching for exhilaration, adrenaline and dopamine all the time. I am doing a lot of sport, I am fit and healthy, I did my degree and worked quite well in a job that I did not like that much. Many tell me how great of a personality I am, how fine I am looking and that I am blessed with my genetics.

The thing is, nobody has to endure what I am feeling. Nobody is in this constant struggle like I am and never have they felt such pain and anxiety in their life. I might seem like a funny and good looking guy on the outside, but my psyche is in severe danger. I am suicidal and broken.

There is no endurance left to continue, since I already tried to change and better myself in every possible way there is. I stopped with drugs, I did more sport, I confronted my mother and tried to speak about my feelings, but nothing helped. Just today I read about the emotional changes of a newborn when its mother is abusing drugs and let me tell you that, this biography perfectly resamples me.

They struggle with emotional regulation, they often have psychological disorders and are in constant procrastination. The fact that I myself have never been responsible for my emotional state is deeply saddening me. For all those years of struggle and fighting, I have never been the problem. Even before I was born and able to think and decide for my own life, there have already been decisions made that threatened my life and my future. I could’ve been born with severe disabilities or mentally damaged in such a enormous way that my mother would’ve probably given me away or just did not care about me at all.

She is the devil and I am sure of that. She is the spawn of Satan and deceived and deceives me to this day. She is only focused on manipulation or intoxication and is always trying to benefit of emotional connections. There has never been a time where I was truly sure about whether she is honestly caring about my emotional being or just about her stake.

I am deeply saddened and am crying so much that I feel like not being able to continue.";r/traumatoolbox;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1o0eb5y/addiction_and_substance_abuse_of_mother/
2025-10-07 08:54:45;Horrible symptoms when confronting a lifetime of sibling abuse and trauma - any advice?;"TW: child abuse, sibling abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, child sexual abuse.

FYI I've been diagnosed with chronic PTSD, with at times severely dissociative symptoms, in relation to severe sibling abuse and parental neglect (which I explain below). I'm hoping people here might have some solidarity or advice to offer, though just venting is valuable for me too.

I grew up in a wildly dysfunctional home. My father was emotionally and verbally abusive of my mother, sister and me. He also physically abused me, which my other family members witnessed. My mother took out her misery at being in such a horrible marriage on my sister, via her own iteration of emotional and verbal abuse. My father (unbeknownst to my mother and sister) sexually abused me from a very young age. And my sister (mostly unbeknownst to my parents) spent years abusing and terrorizing me - emotionally, verbally, and physically; she remains abusive of me, even now that we’re both in our 30s. 

For my whole life, I’ve felt that no one would believe or protect me if I told them how my sister treats me - in part because the few times I tried, no one did believe me (or, rather, they either believed her lies or felt it was easier to behave like it wasn’t true). The rare times I did try to tell others what she did, she would punish me so severely that I wished I had kept my mouth shut - and my mother, in particular, refused to intervene or help me, whether by denying what was happening, ignoring my pleas for help, or telling me to just ignore what was being done to me.

(Some quick examples that are representative of a massive pattern of abuse: My sister once spent an afternoon trying - completely calmly - to break my arm because she thought she would get special perks from our parents if I was injured. She threw water soaked in/full of animal feces into my mouth to punish me. She would berate me in abject rage, and then would physically restrain me and leave bruises all over me if I tried to flee/escape. She would chase me around the house painfully pinching my butt. She would break the lock on the bathroom door while I was showering, tear the shower curtain aside, and berate me while I cowered, naked, in the shower. She would pin me to the ground and tickle me until she provoked a severe asthma attack. She would expose herself to me on purpose, and then ridicule me for being uncomfortable being flashed. The list goes on and on and on.)

At this point, I am NC with my father, and was in contact with my sister until about a year ago, when I finally asked my mother to confront what my sister has done to me. I've spent the last year+ begging my mother to take this seriously and to make new and different choices going forward. I didn’t tell her everything my sister has ever done, but I gave her a few examples that I felt were representative of a lot of the patterns of how my sister has treated me. It was terrifying to finally share it with her in such clear terms. 

Her initial reaction was better than I expected. At first, she acknowledged that how my sister has treated me is wrong and abusive, that it’s ongoing, that I should do whatever I need to do to be and feel safe. But things have deteriorated since then and she has reverted to her same patterns. She has ""decided"" that it's reasonable for me to not want to spend time with my sister, but that it's fair for us to have ""equal"" access to our family. To her, that means my sister and I will each be excluded from half of our family's events. My mother calls this ""equal"" and ""fair,"" and ""the only thing she can live with."" I know this is in some ways better than some people ever get from their parents in these family dynamics, and so I don't mean to be ungrateful. But I can't help feeling that, once again, I am being asked to bear the costs and consequences of who my sister is and what she has done. I feel like I am being punished just as much as my sister is for the fact that she has spent my lifetime abusing me.

Confronting this for the past year was challenging on its own, but my mother's recent reiteration of her denial and minimization has sent my dissociation through the roof. I've been in a dissociative fog for weeks and feel like a zombie or like I am existing on autopilot; if nothing is required of me, I just sit still for hours and hours. Plus I've been experiencing intense fear in a physical sense (to the point of shaking, teeth chattering, etc.) when (fears of) feeling betrayed by those who should protect me get stoked. It’s been exhausting.

There is so little out there about sibling abuse. I’ve been reading so much, and I know how often it’s swept under the rug despite it being so common. It’s all been so hard to wrap my head around now. It feels so sad to have kept this to myself for so long, even though I don’t blame myself for doing it. I feel sad for the little girl I was, who even starting at 4 or 5 years old, knew that no one could or would protect me from my sister. And for the adult I am now whose family would prefer to think of my sister as somewhat ""normal"" and redeemable, whose family think her position in our family should be equivalent to mine even after what she's done, rather than confront how one sister was treating the other. And for myself at every age, whose family’s sick prioritization of “family unity” meant that my abuse and brutalization were a worthwhile cost to them.

Anyway. I don't know that I have an ask of this sub. I feel very stuck in this extremely dissociated state because of the reiteration of trauma and the triggering of past trauma. I've tried doing the kinds of sensory-stimulating things that people recommend (like contrasts of temperature, strong smells, etc.) to no avail. I have an excellent therapist who is doing his best to help me navigate this. But I don't know other people with these issues, and thought that perhaps feeling seen and understood could be helpful. And so I have written this.

If anyone relates to any of this, or has any tips for how to make it through this intense dissociative experience, I'd be so grateful to hear from you here!";r/ptsd;6;6;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1o00tti/horrible_symptoms_when_confronting_a_lifetime_of/
2025-10-07 07:27:54;Vivid, frequent nightmares unrelated to trauma?;"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with PTSD around 3 years ago due to an abusive relationship and violent events that occurred within it. 2 years ago, after leaving the relationship, I experienced intense, vivid nightmares. I was essentially reliving the traumatic events with very little changes. I started therapy and have been mostly nightmare-free for about a year.

2 months ago, I started a new position at work that is extremely stressful. I was also contacted by my abuser, which I am sure has triggered me. Since then, I have nightmares almost every night. When I am lucky, I sleep through them or barely wake up. When I am unlucky, I wake up screaming. When my partner tries to wake me, I ""swat"" at him and push him away until I become lucid. There are some nights where I get less than 3 hours of sleep because I wake up 3+ times from nightmares.

The thing is, my nightmares now have nothing to do with my trauma. They are scary situations - home invasions, ghosts, drowning, family members passing away, etc. - but they are not at all related to past events. I can't even identify a common theme, other than intense fear and impending doom.

I am wondering if these nightmares could be related to my PTSD. I began seeing a therapist last month and they are doubtful that they are related because of the difference in content. However, I personally believe that my PTSD, at the very least, makes me more susceptible to hypervigilance and nightmares.

Does anyone have any thoughts or experiences with this? I am considering trying to find a psychiatrist to prescribe me Prazosin just to get some sleep.";r/ptsd;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nzyxjg/vivid_frequent_nightmares_unrelated_to_trauma/
2025-10-07 03:32:19;Is it normal to question if your memories are actually real?;"Full disclosure - I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, but I seem to have a lot of the symptoms.  

For most of my life since I moved away from my parents, I always knew things were bad for me growing up, but I could only ever remember a few very distinct things that happened in a very negative way.  About a week ago however, I was watching an episode of American Dad, and I had a flashback to a point in my life where something just as bad happened to me as in the episode.  I started picturing more and more about my life that I had no prior memories of, and everything was horrifying from my parents being far more abusive than I remember, to kids and teachers using my parents hatred of me to get me in trouble constantly for things I didn't do.  I even distinctly remember a point where someone literally said out loud ""watch this"" and then write insults about me on a wall, and then tell my mom I did it.  I got hit a lot on the ride home as I was fully blamed.


Apparently while I was remembering all of this, I was just staring at my paused TV for a solid hour.  This is the first time I can recall being legitimately triggered by something, but now I'm questioning if I am actually making this all up.  I know trauma can mess with your memories, but why would they regress again after I already remembered it?  Is this normal when remembering trauma?  I am actively seeking therapy, but I'd like to try and know if I was possibly just dreaming or something rather than remembering so I don't accidentally blame everyone in my childhood for things that didn't happen.";r/ptsd;5;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nzsu14/is_it_normal_to_question_if_your_memories_are/

2025-10-06 05:36:39;Looking for advice, my father thinks his neighbors are targeting him;"He is a combat veteran with diagnosed PTSD related to his time in the Army.

He has come to me a few times expressing anger and fear regarding his new upstairs neighbors at his apartment complex and I’m not sure how to help him/what to say.

For some background, he has lived in his apartment for ~5 years. About a year ago some new folks moved in upstairs and he has not been getting along with them.

This all started because he was convinced they hacked into his Amazon account and were trying to steal his order (according to him the address he saw the order going to was not his, but an address in a different city about 2 hours away). He said he knows it was his upstairs neighbors because they started “shuffling around upstairs” when he corrected the delivery address to his own.

Since then, he claims that they may be listening to his phone calls, spying on him through his windows, following him around/enlisting others to follow him around town, stealing his money over the internet, playing cat meowing sound effects in the middle of the night to bother his cat, going into his phone and deleting his contacts, hacking into his social media accounts to give him ads for mental health services, doxxing him on the “ICE tracking apps” (he does not work for ICE) and just generally giving him nasty looks when they see him around the complex.

I looked at his bank accounts with him and there wasn’t anything suspicious. I have attempted to explain to him that these things are very unlikely to be happening and explained why (I used to work in cyber security).

My father is a middle aged white guy who does look like he could be a cop/federal employee. He is very uneasy around people (especially those who are not white) and I have witnessed him aggressively staring down non-white people for no reason whatsoever.

I am convinced his neighbors may be acting nervous around him because of this (they are not white). I’m sure he has given them nasty looks and he has admitted to me that he has called them bad things to their faces.

Do y’all have any recommendations for what I can say/do? I’m worried about his safety and the safety of his neighbors because he does have firearms and has started fights with people in the past.

2025-10-06 05:29:35;I'm going through a rough time, and I've been told that writing h;"Hello everyone. I’m making this post mainly to vent about what my life is like right now, and also because I’ve read that writing things down can be good for your mental health. It’s something I really need because I’m devastated, so I decided to make a post instead of just writing it in a notebook — in case someone here has any advice to give or something that could help me.

I know this is probably going to be long, so I’m warning you in case you start reading and get surprised lol. And in advance, thank you to everyone who even reads a part of this text.

I’m a 22‑year‑old guy who is currently in a complex situation mentally, emotionally, and, frankly, in life in general. To give some context: this year I left university (Criminology and Public Prevention) after doing a tech‑oriented high school track, because I couldn’t manage or be productive continuing with all the problems I was having. I decided to leave and start preparing for civil service exams to work as a librarian.

About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with OCD (Obsessive‑Compulsive Disorder), and since then I’ve been through many difficult moments with my mental health. For anyone wondering (I recommend a quick Google search), OCD is not how it’s portrayed in the normalized stereotype of “you just don’t like disorder or dirt.” It’s much more complex and there are countless different OCD themes.

I first started showing extreme cleanliness symptoms because I felt dirty or felt that what I touched was dirty. To give examples: I washed everything with alcohol and bleach, I showered for hours, I washed clothes without wearing them, I ruined phones from so much alcohol cleaning, and my hands were always bloody from washing with bleach and spending hours washing them in water. This was hard, but what came next was even harder.

OCD can change themes or it can just stick to one theme forever. I started going to therapy and taking antidepressants to treat it (OCD drains your will to live, which can cause depressive symptoms, and antidepressants are what’s prescribed for OCD). I improved regarding contamination but then other themes started to appear. I began to have a lot of intrusive thoughts. “Pure” OCD. My mind bombarded me with horrible, disturbing thoughts I didn’t know how to erase.

I developed PedoOCD — my mind started telling me I was a pedoand liked kids whenever I played with my cousins, saw a child on the street, etc. This was 24/7 in my head while I tried to neutralize it by thinking of other things or telling myself I wasn’t that. Then came intrusive violent sexual thoughts and mental images. My mind was full of horrible thoughts and images about this and I couldn’t take it anymore. Of course, many times I thought about suicide, but I think I’m not brave enough to go through with it.

That brings us to the present, where a few days ago I experienced a traumatic event that’s now occupying my mind in the form of horrible intrusive thoughts.

I made a post in a subreddit about OCD asking about my situation, and someone sent me a DM. When I opened the request, the message said he had a video of himself raping his son and asked if I wanted it. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO REDDIT. But then the nightmare began… a lot of intrusive thoughts about it, graphic images in my mind, all the time. Then I started asking myself if I had done everything I could. If there was something more I could have done to prevent that child from suffering. And of course, all the guilt — my mind telling me I don’t deserve to be happy and be with my family and friends because a child was suffering and I knew and did almost nothing, or that I liked it, etc. These kinds of thoughts don’t let me live.

I’m in therapy and taking medication, and when I told my psychologist about this because I was very anxious, she told me it was fake and that whether it was real or not, many people would have ignored the message or deleted it and not even reported it to Reddit. That didn’t reassure me; I have the same fear as always and don’t know what else to do. I even sent a report to a child abuse prevention organization, but I could only give them the username and I don’t think that’s enough.

This event has made everything I’m living right now just hell.

On top of that, I’ve fallen for a girl but I can’t move forward because my mind constantly tells me I shouldn’t or don’t deserve to enjoy myself (this happens with friends too) because that child, if it’s true, is suffering.

Since then, 24/7 I have different types of thoughts about it:  
– If I didn’t do enough for that child  
– If I’m in favor of the thoughts  
– Mental images in my head about it all day  
– When I’m happy, I think I don’t deserve to be happy because that child is being hurt in the meantime.

About the girl: I like her, she’s a friend of my friend’s girlfriend, and she’s an absolute angel. But I think she’s out of my league. A week ago we went out partying and my friends and my friend’s girlfriend told me she liked me and that I should make a move, but that same day she’d been at a family gathering they do every year to remember her father who died 10 years ago, so I thought it wasn’t the moment. But still, she’s out of my league.

Also, I’m studying for the librarian exams but I like studying 0 and procrastinate a lot, plus I’m ruminating all day.

Next week the league starts and maybe she’ll come see the match or something; my friend’s girlfriend said they would come.

This is my life now, feeling like crap every day but not knowing how to make it change…

2025-10-06 03:15:39;Deposition;"Newly diagnosed 😵‍💫 after 25 years it's finally in black and white. Feeling all the things- WHY didn't I or my people or any of my doctors or counselors figure this out sooner ffs?! It seems so blatantly obvious now and I grieve for all the time lost,  especially the loss of myself and my loved ones whom I've pushed away. 
I'm pretty overwhelmed at the moment but trying to find ways to move forward. 
I will be getting started with EMDR and CPT soon and in order to wholly heal I know I have to dig up all the things I have buried. 

So my question. Does anyone know if I can get a copy of my deposition I did with the sheriff's office? It was about 10 years ago. 
Also wondering if they might have a transcript of my victims statement? Not sure I want to go looking in my house as I will probably uncover other things I'm not ready to deal with yet...

2025-10-05 15:12:02;struggling with a repressed memory;"cw: sexual assault/child abuse

so i (18f) have just gone to college. this last spring, i did emdr. i long suspected i’d been a victim of csa - i had multiple behaviors throughout late childhood/adolescence that indicated that, and my mom quietly suspected it too, but i never remembered anything explicitly, it was all just a gut feeling that i tried to push down. i had other childhood trauma i was dealing with and so i decided to do emdr. i processed through a lot of it and then i started having repressed memories come up of being sexually assaulted. i don’t know how old i was, but i can remember it fairly clearly, and it’s been really rough to deal with. all this to say, i’ve been partaking in studies at my college (i am broke and need money) and because i mark the boxes for someone with trauma i’ve been doing childhood trauma studies. they have me do ptsd diagnosis checklists and i’ve found myself checking off more than i expected. i’m still largely functioning normally, but i’m worried i’m beginning to meet the diagnostic criteria for ptsd from the sa. i also dissociate a lot (like a lot) on the regular so that’s probably the main reason i’m still functioning. but is it even possible to develop ptsd from a memory i didn’t even remember until a while ago? and it’s specific to this memory too, because it was so shattering to me. i don’t feel valid in the symptoms because it was so long ago and it’s weird it’s showing up now after i took leave from emdr back in july. and i don’t really know what to do. any advice would be really, really appreciated.";r/ptsd;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nyhkco/struggling_with_a_repressed_memory/
2025-10-05 11:02:37;Im not recovered enough for what i did.;"I (20f) was in a relationship with the craziest person I've ever met. He was bipolar, a diagnosed sociopath, and a psycho. I didn't know any of this when i met him. 

A few days ago i reconnected with someone that I used to kinda be fwb with for a few months. Ill call him jack. I have always been head over heals for him and had originally stopped talking to him after getting with my ex. Since reconnecting we have been talking about seeing each other  so after work i met up with his and we parked by the lakeside. We smoked weed which i think was the main thing that caused me to freak out. 

We were making out and started to go farther. I was having a great time until we did end up going farther. I started freaking out. I was hyperventilating. I couldn't breath. There was music playing super loud. I just felt way over stimulated. It felt like everything was collapsing on myself.  honestly all i could see was my ex on top of me when he would assault me.  It's not jacks fault. I wanted to be there. I wanted to be with him. I chose to go see him. He didn't even know that anything was wrong. and TMI but i was able to mask my kind of crying and hyperventilating as moans and he was having a good time so i know he couldn't tell. 

I just cant stop thinking about it. My ex is currently serving 17 years for all the charges i pressed on him. I have no reason to be scared of him still.

this was just the worst panic attack I've ever had. I've had them before but i never had just straight flashbacks before. I remember looking up and it just felt like i was right back there and everything was happening. I felt like i was right back to when i was being assaulted even though no assault took place. I don't know what to do. 

This post isn't for anyone or anything. I just need to vent. I hardly have any friends and i feel like I'm disappearing. 

All I know is that I wasn't ready for what I did last night. I think this is me accepting that no matter how fixed I think i am because i barely think about my ex anymore doesn't mean that I've recovered. 

If anyone can relate to me or has experienced the same thing I would appreciate a dm. I feel desperate. I need to talk to someone who doesn't look at me like ""oh you poor thing"" i just need someone who has gone through this same shit.

2025-10-05 06:31:27;What are the worst symptoms to deal with for you?;"I had a traumatic event 10 years ago and developed PTSD out of a result although I only got diagnosed last year. Due to a lot of therapy and inner work I consider myself almost symptom free…although I know that PTSD never quite leaves the brain.

So now reflecting back on my symptoms I think these were the most difficult to deal with for me:

* hyper vigilance: feeling constant on edge, like sth itching under my skin
* Paranoia and constant confusion: not knowing when to trust my mind or when I am being triggered; issues with forming intimacy.
* Fear of the fear, and struggling with gastritis because of it — the fear feels different now, as if a fuse blew due to the trauma. I feel extreme fear even when it has nothing to do with my trauma anymore.
* Rumination -  like a grave digger looking for a solution only creating more problems
* Mourning the carefree person I used to be.
* Feeling alone and truly out of place, with hardly anyone understanding my behavior.
* The need to control everything, and feeling helpless over the smallest incident.
* Dissociation: being numb for days, living in a haze, feeling clumsy, unable to concentrate, and guilty for not being able to listen.

I used to suffer from panic attacks, but somehow they were not the worst part for me — they actually felt like a time-out from the constant itch. I was never afraid of dying, probably because I knew what was happening in those moments. Luckily, I rarely had to deal with nightmares.";r/ptsd;73;50;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ny7l00/what_are_the_worst_symptoms_to_deal_with_for_you/
2025-10-05 00:02:11;Is it normal to have the urge to be re-traumatised?;"For context: I left an abusive relationship about 1.5 years ago. He used to physically, verbally and sexually abuse me. One of the lowest point of the relationship was when he nearly killed me by chocking. During the relationship, I never told anyone or called the police. I internalised everything really deeply. Since I escaped, I have now told all of my friends and family too. It was hard to do it but I did. Of course I now feel like I should have told the police during the relationship and still feel like I should now (i haven’t yet and am still debating it).

I have been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety. I have had very mild visual flashbacks in the past (none for the past 6months) but most of the trauma comes out as nightmares or emotional flashbacks during the day. I am also quite aware of the trauma and tend to hyper analyse what is going on now/what happened to me.

The question: I now have a new partner and i tried to see what my limit would be with light chocking during intimacy yesterday. We were being very careful as I am aware of the risks and how fragile I still am but I got triggered and had a flashback. This is the first time in a while that I have had such a blatantly clear flashback. It really caught me off guard. My partner reacted really well and helped me immediately of course. He stayed with me for a few hours after the incident but unfortunately had to go back home because of work. I was a bit shaken and felt unsettled but relatively fine. I ended up sleeping a lot but now that I’ve woken up, I keep thinking about scenarios where I would be in the same situation as some of the abusive events with my ex. For example, I have this scenario in my head as him slapping me and pushing me around and me trying to get away but being unable to. Or it would be the same scenario but then this time I manage to call/tell someone or police. Or another scenario but it ends before the « end » when I’m screaming at myself to move but I can’t because I’m frozen or force myself to try to call the police.

I feel like I WANT to be put back in such a situation again.

I am unsure if this is some part of PTSD or flashback or maybe the fantasy that if I ever was put back in such a situation again, I would be able to do something different?

I don’t really know what is going on as I have a bit of brain fog now. Also, can PTSD episodes last longer than the actual flashback?";r/ptsd;12;13;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nxxucj/is_it_normal_to_have_the_urge_to_be_retraumatised/

2025-10-03 21:03:28;Death (TW);I am a 24yo female. I have diagnosed PTSD and anxiety/depression. My partner of 6 years died in a motorcycle accident with a school bus when I was 2 weeks from giving birth at the time to a daughter we planned on putting up for adoption (closed). My boyfriend only had the motorcycle for four months. He had all his gear on and died on impact. The cop cried when he told me after realizing I was pregnant and home alone. I had to organize his funeral while I was so pregnant I could barely walk. I decided whay to do with the destroyed bike, and dealt with lawyers and paperwork. I ended up having an emergency Csection (we were having complications with her heart stopping) and I chose an open adoption. About a month later, my uncle died from a heart attack that put him in a coma. A few weeks after that, my hedgehog died from old age and bled out in her cage. A few weeks later, my foster kitten died from pneumonia. A month later, my 5yo dog developed a brain tumor and declined so I chose to euthanize him, and that same day on my way home from that appointment, my grandpa Michael (my only father figure in life) had a heart attack and died in his sleep. I am convinced that death is following me. I was terrified to go to sleep for a while out of fear I would die in my sleep. I get easily frightened when I drive, especially around motorcycles. I have moments where I am okay, and moments where I am not. I have panic attacks, with the worst one being so bad I almost blacked out while driving. It has now been 2 years since the accident. In 1 month will be the anniversary. I still have not figured out what I live for. I have a husband now, he loves me a lot and holds my hand through everything. I have ESA cats, I do not take them to non pet friendly places though (personal preference). I have considered a service dog since I have a slew of other health issues regarding my BP tanking and hearing loss as well but it is too expensive. My psychiatrist is not super helpful and medications give me a lot of anxiety due to past trauma regarding them with my mom. I had a not great childhood and this compounded with it has really not helped the situation. ;r/ptsd;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nwyjzl/death_tw/

2025-10-03 01:43:03;"""I'm going through a rough time, and I've been told that writing";"Hello everyone. I’m making this post mainly to vent about what my life is like right now, and also because I’ve read that writing things down can be good for your mental health. It’s something I really need because I’m devastated, so I decided to make a post instead of just writing it in a notebook — in case someone here has any advice to give or something that could help me.

I know this is probably going to be long, so I’m warning you in case you start reading and get surprised lol. And in advance, thank you to everyone who even reads a part of this text.

I’m a 22‑year‑old guy who is currently in a complex situation mentally, emotionally, and, frankly, in life in general. To give some context: this year I left university (Criminology and Public Prevention) after doing a tech‑oriented high school track, because I couldn’t manage or be productive continuing with all the problems I was having. I decided to leave and start preparing for civil service exams to work as a librarian.

About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with OCD (Obsessive‑Compulsive Disorder), and since then I’ve been through many difficult moments with my mental health. For anyone wondering (I recommend a quick Google search), OCD is not how it’s portrayed in the normalized stereotype of “you just don’t like disorder or dirt.” It’s much more complex and there are countless different OCD themes.

I first started showing extreme cleanliness symptoms because I felt dirty or felt that what I touched was dirty. To give examples: I washed everything with alcohol and bleach, I showered for hours, I washed clothes without wearing them, I ruined phones from so much alcohol cleaning, and my hands were always bloody from washing with bleach and spending hours washing them in water. This was hard, but what came next was even harder.

OCD can change themes or it can just stick to one theme forever. I started going to therapy and taking antidepressants to treat it (OCD drains your will to live, which can cause depressive symptoms, and antidepressants are what’s prescribed for OCD). I improved regarding contamination but then other themes started to appear. I began to have a lot of intrusive thoughts. “Pure” OCD. My mind bombarded me with horrible, disturbing thoughts I didn’t know how to erase.

I developed P OCD — my mind started telling me I was a p and liked kids whenever I played with my cousins, saw a child on the street, etc. This was 24/7 in my head while I tried to neutralize it by thinking of other things or telling myself I wasn’t that. Then came intrusive violent sexual thoughts and mental images. My mind was full of horrible thoughts and images about this and I couldn’t take it anymore. Of course, many times I thought about suicide, but I think I’m not brave enough to go through with it.

That brings us to the present, where a few days ago I experienced a traumatic event that’s now occupying my mind in the form of horrible intrusive thoughts.

I made a post in a subreddit about OCD asking about my situation, and someone sent me a DM. When I opened the request, the message said he had a video of himself raping his son and asked if I wanted it. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO REDDIT. But then the nightmare began… a lot of intrusive thoughts about it, graphic images in my mind, all the time. Then I started asking myself if I had done everything I could. If there was something more I could have done to prevent that child from suffering. And of course, all the guilt — my mind telling me I don’t deserve to be happy and be with my family and friends because a child was suffering and I knew and did almost nothing, or that I liked it, etc. These kinds of thoughts don’t let me live.

I’m in therapy and taking medication, and when I told my psychologist about this because I was very anxious, she told me it was fake and that whether it was real or not, many people would have ignored the message or deleted it and not even reported it to Reddit. That didn’t reassure me; I have the same fear as always and don’t know what else to do. I even sent a report to a child abuse prevention organization, but I could only give them the username and I don’t think that’s enough.

This event has made everything I’m living right now just hell.

On top of that, I’ve fallen for a girl but I can’t move forward because my mind constantly tells me I shouldn’t or don’t deserve to enjoy myself (this happens with friends too) because that child, if it’s true, is suffering.

Since then, 24/7 I have different types of thoughts about it:  
– If I didn’t do enough for that child  
– If I’m in favor of the thoughts  
– Mental images in my head about it all day  
– When I’m happy, I think I don’t deserve to be happy because that child is being hurt in the meantime.

About the girl: I like her, she’s a friend of my friend’s girlfriend, and she’s an absolute angel. But I think she’s out of my league.

What are your thoughts on EMDR therapy and did it help with your trauma? Our back story is that my husband is a US Army vet and suffered from some heavy trauma in the last few years of his service regarding his job within the military. Long story short he has seen some horrible, horrible things and he began having nightmares that made things even worse. He was diagnosed with PTSD, OIT (obsessive intrusive thoughts) and not formally diagnosed but suspected to have OCD as well. He was in talk therapy for a year and a half which didn't help much and is on an SSRI and a med for helping with the nightmares. I suggested he start EMDR since he didn't like talk therapy and he agreed and has been going for a few weeks now but not much progress has been made. His overall mental health was getting worse and he was drinking heavily to cope and then two weeks ago attempted to end his life, luckily he survived and I'm very grateful. We had a bit of an intervention and things are a tiny bit better now but he's still obviously not in a good place mentally. He had a Dr appointment regarding his meds and his doctor mentioned that EMDR can initially make you feel worse due to all of the trauma coming to the surface, but over time it should get better and that they may adjust or change SSRI's to help as well. For those of you who have done EMDR, what was your experience? Did it help? If it did, did you have problems with feeling worse at first? Any other suggestions on how I can best support my husband is appreciated as well. Trying to navigate this has been really difficult.

My mom was one of the only people that showed me true love, but also started doing drugs after she was raped as a teenager by her stepfather. Hence, her mental age kind of froze in her teenage years. I tried to love and protect her as long as I could while she lost custody of me, but things just kept getting worse. I didn’t really care about my hurt, but she kept hurting. I loved every visitation, even when my siblings would not go (I am the eldest), but then it seemed like she would end up in the hospital or a literal ditch after each visit because she needed drugs to seem normal and then would be sad when I left. I finally just tried to give her all of my love and try to let her go temporarily to heal because I felt like I was doing more damage than good. Also, I was being raised by people who were not fans of her, so the grown ups in my life only told me I was holding on to nothing. I always saw her as a fun grandma in the future when we both healed. Then on my 24th birthday, she had taken her own life. It is has been years since then but is so hard not to feel anger, guilt, self-hatred, and lost at almost all times. It is one thing for a loved one to take a life, but it is another when your most beloved parents takes their own life on your birthday. They felt so much sorrow on the day you were born, they decided to take their own life. Now anyone relatively close to me feels pity towards me and anger towards the mother I still love.

2025-10-01 12:01:04;Medicine is working!;"Anyone here taking any medication? How’s it working for you?

I’m very new to this and still learning.

Earlier this year, I was severely harassed by my manager, emotionally abused, and eventually forced to resign due to my medical condition (not related to PTSD).
Long story short, I was diagnosed with provisional PTSD earlier this month because of the traumatic events that happened to me at work.

Things were going fine at my new job until last week, when someone in higher leadership suddenly called me out publicly and blamed me for something I was specifically asked to do by another senior leader. I had never even talked to this person before, it came completely out of nowhere. Afterward, he excluded me from further communication.

At first, I thought I was okay, but two days later I started shaking in bed and couldn’t get up because I felt like if I got up, I’d have to face work. That went on for a few days.

Coincidentally, I had a doctor’s appointment. He prescribed Hydroxyzine 25mg and mentioned it might make me sleepy. So I started taking it before bedtime.

This medication not only stops the morning shaking, but also helps me sleep much better. I’ve always had trouble falling asleep, but now I actually feel almost fantastic in the mornings, haha.

When reading about (C)PTSD I can relate my symptoms to it so much - especially the mood swings, dissociation, reliving the events, nightmares, insomnia, fears and avoidance. There's probably more I can list.

According to 2 different psychiatrists I do not tick all the boxes and the required score. These were under the same hospital and NHS based. I do wonder about going private if that would make a difference?

I am diagnosed with Dissociative Disorder, Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

My private therapist (waiting lists are too long in the NHS), family and previous Support workers, and other survivors have all agreed I have PTSD - but getting it diagnosed is another story. 

I am on medication: Quetiapine (for mood balance and sleep), Diazapam (Anxiety and sleep), and Fluoxtine (for depression).

2025-09-29 21:41:01;Does this sound like PTSD or am I overreacting? (Not looking for a diagnosis, just want to know to contact GP or not.);"Just want to start by reiterating, I am not looking for a diagnosis. Also, TW - Self Harm and Suicidal thoughts.

 I have never been through what I would class as serious trauma, but lately I have been wondering if I have some mild form of PTSD. 
I would feel silly going to the GP about it at the moment as I am unsure if I am just overreacting or not - the reasons (which I will give in a moment) seem very childlike on the surface, but I feel like they're a much deeper rooted problem.

Okay, so. I (31f) have suffered with Mental Health issues on and off since I was 12. When I was in High School (I live in Scotland) I was bullied relentlessly to the point I self harmed and was extremely suicidal. At my lowest point, I felt hopeless, lonely, feelings of worthlessness, I had about 2 friends, and all I wanted to do was to not be here anymore. But with a lot of help from my family I made it through. I was 15.
Some of the bullying included physical violence, daily verbal abuse, daily humiliation, and purposefully being excluded from things. Some kids would even invite me to things as a joke, to further the humiliation and laugh about it with their peers. 
Other stuff has happened but it doesn't relate to the next part so I won't include it. 

Since then I have still had episodes, but none have been as bad as they were around this time.

I have attended counselling etc for the bullying I went through and I thought it had helped, but lately I am starting to wonder if it really did help. 

So, now that you have the backstory I'll get into my current situation. 

As I said, I had around 2 friends growing up. 1 of them I still see a lot of, or at least I did until a couple of months ago. We will call her Patricia (31). 
Me and Patricia drifted apart for a little while when we were in our early 20s, but after my Dad passed away she came back into my life. Her Dad has since passed away too so this is something that brought us closer together. 

Patricia's husband has a group of friends that I have met and hung out with on several occasions. One of the friends, we shall call Claire.

Now, Claire (39)  actually started working alongside me around the same time I met the friend group. So we quickly became friends, or so I thought. We have been working together for around 5 years now.

Recently Claire has been having regular (what she calls) ""Girl's Weekends."" This is where it will start to sound childish. 

Myself, Claire and Patricia are all in a group chat with the other friends from the group, some female, some not.

I have been excluded from every single Girl's Weekend, but because I work with Claire she speaks to me about the things she's planning for it, and talks about how theyve gone and how fun they've been etc. Its important to note here that every single girl from the group chat has been invited, except me. They even talk about it and send pictures etc in the chat. 

Now, this is where I feel childish and people may think I am just being jealous but I am not.

Every time I have to hear about their plans its making me feel worthless, lonely, excluded, and all those feelings I had at 15 years old come rushing back. 

The other night I turned my phone off for 2 days because I didn't want to see anything about their girls weekend. I am not jealous, I am glad they're having fun. It's just now its got me thinking things like ""wow, I guess I really am the same person that no one wants to be around."" And now my low self esteem is coming back and my depression is playing up again.

Sorry if this made no sense and if I was rambling in parts. I just needed to get it off my chest.


TL;DR - Am I overreacting or are all these feelings of worthlessness etc (sparked by being excluded - a reminder of my bullying) actually a mild form of PTSD? 

Again, not looking for a diagnosis. Just want to know whether it is worth mentioning to a doctor, or if it would be a waste of their time.

Thanks.";r/ptsd;2;3;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1ntibxi/does_this_sound_like_ptsd_or_am_i_overreacting/
2025-09-29 00:13:37;How do you cope when surrounded by your trauma?;"TW: vague reference to abuse by a sibling

My therapist and I suspect I have PTSD/CPTSD (not diagnosed yet). Most of my trauma comes from my difficult and unstable home life. To summarize, most of my immediate family has bipolar disorder along with other mental health conditions. One of my brothers—let’s call them G—has traumatized me a lot over the years. He has gotten way better over the years, but he recently got into a fight with me and my parents that was triggering. Because of going on a new medication he’s lost some stability. It’s hard to cope with the stress because I can’t just say “it’s fine, it won’t happen again, you’re not there anymore” since there’s no guarantee of that. I love G, but I still have very conflicting feelings over what he did and continues to do to me.

Does anyone have any coping strategy suggestions? I have a hard time grounding in general as I struggle with dissociation (probably due to the PTSD) and I’m hypo sensitive to touch.";r/ptsd;8;6;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nssbir/how_do_you_cope_when_surrounded_by_your_trauma/
2025-09-28 14:09:34;How to not be a target;"To preface this, for some reason or another I am targeted by violent people or just people trying to take advantage of me. My therapist has told me it’s likely due to my hair color, skin color, height, and that I am a bit heavier right now due to medical issues outside of my control honestly. I was never violent as a child and actually people have noted I was very kind and even thought I was special needs because I tried to befriend people with disabilities ironically. Only thing I was diagnosed with until I turned about 17 was genetically caused anxiety and depression as the people in my extended family all have some sort of anxiety depression. 

My first instance of a true assailant was when I was around 5th grade. This kid on my street me and him got along well and we would hang out at each others houses play games and where friends. This changed when he brought along his other friend who was substantially taller and bigger than me at the time. He would make up excuses to punch me and even would make fun of medical issues I had as a young child that sent even that uncommon. One day I was laying on the couch and he just started to punch me out of the blue right in the soft spot of my chest/solar plexus. He knew exactly where to punch me so I had no air to even fight back or escape. I didn’t even understand what was going on at the time and would just leave tell my dad he would talk to the other parents and my friend would say I started the fights because he knew the other guy longer. 

Fast forward in middle school almost all my friends tried to take advantage of me one way or another. They would belittle me dismiss my accomplishments and try to make me feel lesser than them. They even would victimize themselves when I would try to fight back or challenge them. They would all gang up on me and try to hurt me emotionally although I just would get pissed off. I stopped hanging out with them after a couple years. 

Highschool I was outcasted mainly due to my underwhelming athletic performance. I didn’t fit in with the geeks the athletes, stoners or just normal guys. I spent a lot of time alone and even the few friends I had I was never the first option and was usually the last. Essentially they thought I just wasn’t cool enough or my humour and speach was somewhat off. My mannerism and  they way I talk has been noted by people and my therapist as atypical although not resemblance as autistic or other neurodivergence’s. I just have an A typical speech pattern for some reason and I think it’s because I didn’t have a lot of friends to really socialize and build a personality off of. I also played a lot of online games and that speach pattern is more akin to how I speak which is a mix of factual, random, and I make otherwise odd connections in conversation. I’ve been compared to Theo bob in the way I make connections to to things actually. I got into more fights than most people at my school I would say and that’s only because most of my school was soft and didn’t fight. All of them were in self defense mainly from unwanted physical contact or people taking my stuff. So people started to see me as hot headed and violent even though I was the one who was being screwed with constantly. 

The end of my high school couldn’t have ended worse. I was involved in runouts and such and was forced to go to a mental institution due to police coercion. The first hospital even denied me saying I was stable and wasn’t a threat to anyone or myself. Second one was like the 5th and 7th circle of Hell from Dante’s Inferno. I felt as if I was one of those souls that fell through the cracks and was mistaken for crimes I did not commit.  I’m afraid this may all be due to some of my conversations with God when I was younger where I would say if I can’t be loved I would rather be feared. I must’ve not been meant for love so I was made to be feared among men on one side and seen as a weak animal on the other.  All I want is to be left alone now. I see that the only way to get away from this is to be cursed into isolation to minimize the risk of the world. 

I am not violent I do not hate peoples for what they have done to me; I hate the things they have done to me. I do not want to fight outside of sport, I do not want to be stolen from outside of a game, I do not wish to be hated or feared for things outside my control.

2025-09-28 13:45:09;Possible sexual assault;"ANOTHER CW: SEXUAL CONTENT
So I (24f) was diagnosed with PTSD at 21 after starting therapy when I was dumped by my ex girlfriend. It’s mainly from my mother emotionally and mentally abusing me, as well as other family members + the ex I mentioned, but recently I believe there’s memories coming forth that my brain isn’t letting myself fully remember. Almost every time I have sex with my current girlfriend, I have a horrific reaction afterwards. My last one, I was screaming and crying for 30 mins so uncontrollably it had started to scare me. My girlfriend (bless her heart) had to peel me from our bed and bathe me because I couldn’t do it myself. I’ve had theories that a certain family member has assaulted me, based of information I’m not comfortable sharing as it involves other family members, but I don’t even know where to begin exploring this. Has anybody else experienced this? These kind of, I guess, panic attacks happen when I’m experiencing things that are similar to other trauma I’ve had, like I drowned once and anytime my hair is wet and in front of my face and it feels like I can’t breathe, I freak out. I just want to get to the bottom of this so I can work through it, I hate not being able to have relations with my girlfriend as it’s something very important to us.

2025-09-28 10:38:18;#medical #PTSD #birth #trauma #toxic;I was diagnosed with PTSD that I know I’ve struggled with for a very long time but it took me fining the right therapist and psychologist to get the proper care for. I think I more so have CPTSD but to start I had two very traumatizing births. My first pregnancy I gave birth at 28 weeks with no found underlying cause. I was 29 years old and healthy in all aspects. However, towards the end I had symptoms of going into early labor that I would report to my OB and they would consistently say they “were normal symptoms”. So I never got checked to see if I was ever in early labor. Understandably, it was my first pregnancy and I was healthy so I can understand why very little concern for this was. I gave birth at 28 weeks to a 3lb 5oz baby boy and he had to stay in the NICU for about two months. When he came home he was pretty much healthy and no complications. I was told that from now on, any pregnancy moving forward would be considered high risk and I would need to be highly monitored. I got pregnant again about a year later and miscarried very early at 6 weeks (they never checked me out or did blood work or anything to verify it was a miscarriage) they literally just took my word for it. I then got pregnant with my daughter and had early bleeding signs around 12 weeks but was not miscarrying and they couldn’t figure out why. I was monitored very closely and towards the end I was in the ER weekly for possibly being in early labor. I started dilating at about 34weeks and even stayed 4cm and 90% effected for almost 4 weeks! When my water finally did break at 37weeks, I was instantly rushed by ambulance to triage where they clarified I was 5cm and 100% effaced and going into labor fast (as expected and very known to the staff and hospital). They left me in triage for over an HOUR IN ACTIVE LABOR WITH NO PAIN MANAGEMENT! By the time I got to labor and delivery I couldn’t get in place for the epidural because I progressed so fast. They wouldn’t even give me anything through my IV to help and to top it off they were speaking to me horribly. I was screaming in excruciating pain and they told me to stop yelling, the one nurse kept dropping my leg to do other things, I was extremely dehydrated begging for ice chips and told “we have other things to worry about”. This is only a very small summary of what happened. But, it really has ruined me and my trust and I physically have became so ill from it all.

2025-09-27 23:17:57;25f I find myself on edge when people randomly clap. I can't be sure why;"Hi all. I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was inpatient in a hospital in '23 following assaults and a stalking incident. Ever since then I've been a different person. A lost a lot of trust in the world at that time, because the hospital that was treating me ended up committing malpractice too. I have not gotten any criminal or civil justice for anything and don't anticipate that ever happening because of my family's financial barriers (honestly I think the perpetrators were aware of this). 

I don't know what to do but my heart is sad and exhausted despite being on medication and participating in weekly hour long talk therapy sessions with a EMDR licensed PTSD focused psychotherapist- and I take a medicine regiment as prescribed too. But I'm not stupid like Im never going to be able to forget what those succesful, well liked, professional appearing men were capable of. It's terrifying so I don't like to leave the house or socialize much. I just can't trust anyone at all to not be linked to those people to be honest. 

Today at the cafe, some white guy who was coding offhandedly ***clapped his hands together.*** I don't know why but I know Ive become hyper sensitive to that sound in public. It happens sometimes if Im at a restaurant or other public space that a person, usually a man will clap to make a point or fidget or something and I feel a wave of anxiety. I know Im highly reactive in general to sensory outputs because my body is subconsciously anticipating an assault. But it makes me feel very isolated and weird. Like I don't begrudge anyone from making noises in public. My logical brain knows it is a harmless action but my anxious feelings and trauma memories can't stop bracing for impact.

2025-09-27 10:52:45;Ptsd making me want to end my healthy relationship;"I don't know if I can work through this with my boyfriend. He's been nothing but kind, sweet and comprenhensive with my problems, but past the first months of our relationship I've found myself hating when he touches me, when he asks genuinely wanting to know more about my interests, or when he wants to call. Basically, things every relationship has.

My ptsd comes from an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship I've had at 15, I'm 18 now but started dating my current boyfriend about 4 months after breaking up with my ex. I didn't cry when breaking up with that guy, I simply felt relief. I didn't cry for months, as if I blocked everything about the trauma but eventually I started to get worse and worse, got diagnosed and I think what I feel is related to that. My therapist says I'm afraid of emotional intimacy after what I've gone through.

I haven't told my boyfriend about this, sometimes I don't wanna talk to him or listen to his voice. I know I love him, but I don't know if now that I've started to process the trauma, being in a relationship is ideal for me. We've never fought, he always listened to me and we're about to celebrate two years together. I feel like a terrible girlfriend because I was actually better with my ex, making gifts and writing long texts and letters, but now I'm like this. I always play along or change topics when he starts to asks too much questions about my day, but I don't know how much longer can I keep this up.

I also live alone, and I go to university from 7-1pm and then stay working/helping in a museum until 7pm, and whenever I see his texts I just want to say something VERY hostile but I keep it cool by answering ""i'm busy"". 

I don't want to tell him all of this because what even would our relationship be without nice words, listening to each other, physical contact, etc? That would make us more like friends. But I love him, he respected me asking for no intimacy because I'm not ready, but I don't know how long I can keep all of this up. I hate that my past relationship affected me so much I can't be the lover girl I used to be anymore.";r/ptsd;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nrkapt/ptsd_making_me_want_to_end_my_healthy_relationship/
2025-09-26 23:34:36;Do you also get triggered by the most random things?;"I have diagnosed C-PTSD and OCD stemming from trauma, and I feel every day like I'm walking on egg shells around my own heart region. The triggers that can induce full blown panic attacks for me are random things but they also feel connected to the most random 'traumatic experiences' from my life. For example, I almost never have flashbacks to my almost comically unsafe childhood. I only ruminated on traumatic stuff from my childhood that time before I went to university, during my 4 years long late teen period where I didn't have any friends NOR family that wasn't being intentionally hostile and damaging towards me. But now, I can't watch a random balck eyed peas videoclip on youtube, because the imagery in some way is ""reminding me of the (intrusive and untrue) thought of my boyfriend still being in love with his ex"". It sounds ridiculous, but I had a full blown panic attack from this "" trigger"" today and couldn't get any work done because of it. I can't have conversations with people about social stuff, because the most random things they say makes me relive a lifequitting attack of heartbreak that I'm not sure I've ever even experienced for real-existing and justifiable reasons. I have to excuse myself and go home to sit out the wave of panic. I've googled ""why do i feel too much"" but my therapists suggests it's all PTSD as we continue to follow the EMDR schedule (60 sessions planned and we're very delayed). It's like all the gnarly and unsafe and impossible psychological conditions were installed in my body as a child/teen, so that I can now experience full body terror thrice a week for absolutely no reason at all. Not absolutely no reason, because I've still experienced things other people would find impossible to deal with, but why did I ""survive"" severe abuse but can't handle normal 'traumatic' fake-heartbreak and rejection? And why do the second experiences seem to hurt so much more, interfere so much more with my life and cause so much more pain than being munchausen by proxied by my entire family into thinking I was severely mentally handicapped my entire childhood (among other wild things, like SA, street assault and 'poblemacy' in the youth care system)?

2025-09-26 22:22:06;How do you handle unexpected triggers?;"Earlier this month, I was diagnosed with provisional PTSD, about 6 months after a traumatic experience. I’m still very new to all of this.

The trauma happened at a very toxic and hostile workplace, where there was no ethical leadership. I was severely harassed and emotionally abused by management. Eventually, a false allegation led to a life-threatening medical incident, and I had to resign for my own safety. (Yes, I was qualified for unemployment because “I quit due to illegal activities at work site”, ruled on the order by administrative law judge.)

At the psychiatric clinic I’ve been going to, they identified that situation as the core traumatic event and listed it as the cause of my PTSD.

Now, I’ve started a new job. Everything had been going okay—until 2 days ago. During a virtual meeting, a senior leader called me out in front of others for doing something another senior leader had specifically asked me to do. I was told to “stop further communication because you are confusing people.”

I had a flashback to the harassment I went through at my previous job. My heart started pounding. My breathing became short. I couldn’t think. It was like I was right back there.

I know, it’s like, nothing. Things like this happen at work. But here I am, I’m shaking in my bed not being able to get out…. To start working.

I really don’t know what to do. Would I ever be able to keep one job? Or would I keep quitting until I find a job where nobody at work starts yelling? I’m just so scared. I’m just so scared of my future.

The psychiatric clinic recommended medication that I can take in anticipation of stressful events—like 20 minutes beforehand. I’m seeing my primary care doctor today to discuss that. But honestly… how do you “predict” a random trigger like this at work?

What kinds of treatments or coping strategies have worked for you, especially in professional settings where triggers can come out of nowhere?

2025-09-26 19:10:38;Sertonin syndrome recovery help;"TW:MEDICAL TRAUMA, HOSPITALS, MEDICAL TESTING, vomiting mentioned

NO GORE INVOLVED regarding medical trauma or tests.




Hi there, this is gonna be long bc it’s a complicated story so I understand if you don’t want to read.

so I had the very unfortunate experience of have sertonin poisoning two times in the span of 3 months. Once because my doctor overdosed me, and the other bc while tapering the drug down my body wasn’t metabolizing the drug and I was given MORE SSRIs to try to help with the withdrawal impacts I was having while tapering. 

The secondary sertonin syndrome traumatized me- truly. I thought I had really bad withdrawal- I was confused, I didn’t know where I was sometimes, I would see spots in my vision, I was vomiting and dirrehea, not eating, losing weight, shaking, not sleeping, panicked every single hour of the day until I reached to when I needed to take the next dose (aka half life). I just assumed okay I just gotta through this for a few more weeks and I’ll be okay- every day it got worse. 

Everyone told me it was withdrawal and I tried to brave through it. I really wondered if I could survive feeling this way- how this could be normal. And then things got really really bad and I couldn’t move my entire body- I couldn’t relax my feet, it’s like they were stuck in high heel shoe position. I couldn’t walk and my jaw went clenched. The only thing that moved was my head shaking non stop and the tremble of my left leg. 

I begged and cried to go to the ER- my parents didn’t believe me thought it was withdrawal. I finally convinced them when I said if you don’t drive me I will drive as I actively was unsure of even where I fully was. 

It was sertonin syndrome and bad- the sweating starting, confusion got worse. Luckily they recognized it. I had all the symptoms and it had slowly been building up during the taper. Which rarely happens in sertonin poisoning but happened with me.

I was given tons of drugs- rushed into the ICU with so much blood work and testing and people and EKGs and IV fluids pumping. I kept getting confused why I wasn’t wearing my shirt (they had me
In a hospital gown at this point). They messed up and gave me anti nausea medicine before consulting with the psychiatrist- that made me worse bc it can increase sertonin. 

I remember just waves crashing into me of panic even as a recovered in the ICU- I could feel them coming. I remember the psych coming to my room
To a neurological exam and not raise my legs very high anymore or relax my muscles. And I sobbed and begged him not to let me die because I’m in my 20s. 

I remember my mom rubbing my legs and the hot compresses and the vomiting and the wires and the beeping and every day feeling no time had passed.

I got better, I stabilized. I got to watch some funny movies on tv, I loved my nurses, I stopped puking, got put on a strict diet bc my creatinine was so bad from the sertonin atrophying my muscles and bc of my weight loss. 

I was taken off ALL sertonin drugs cold turkey for my safety and given benzos to stabilize while I detox the drug put so that I can sleep and eat and my body can recover. I’m on a strict tapering schedule with the benzos obviously and on heart meds to keep my rhythm slower. 

I was so tiredand stumbling around unable to walk unassisted for days when I got home- and now I’m feeling more energized and the anxiety has come back bc of it. The psych said it could come back (anxiety) but as long as I didn’t have sertonin I was through the fatality side of it and I was okay- it would just take 2 weeks to fully be 100% gone. 

But the panic attacks are scaring me now that they’re back. I know it’s normal bc I’m recovering and have energy to have them and I was in a traumatizing situation, but all I can do when I feel it is imagine me in that bed, begging not to die. And feeling sick. Every wave of panic and breathlessness, I’m back in that icu bed gripping to the arm of the bed and willing God to let me make it just another hour.

I’m in therapy and have been diagnosed with ptsd but it’ll take time to obviously have the work we do start having an impact. How to I tell myself I’m safe still!? How can I let my body have its panic attacks and know I’m not back in that ICU.

I don’t know how to have panic attacks anymore without the ptsd and crying. I’m scared. I don’t want to go back there. I’m going to have anxiety- I’m going cold turkey off meds and it’s a good sign of recovery but my brain says we are back there.

2025-09-05 00:03:47;I left my abusive parents, but I still miss them …;"I was adopted at 3. Before that, my biological mother neglected me, and I bounced between unstable foster homes. My adoptive parents—my only parents—took in both me and my sister, keeping us together even knowing how damaged we might be. I’ll always be grateful for that.

But the same parents who saved me also abused me. From the time I was adopted until I left at 20, I endured physical and emotional abuse. I grew up thinking fear was love. My dad would choke me, hit me, or scream at me at night. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and self-injury behaviors. Flashbacks still hit me, especially in the dark.

When I was 8 or 9, I started hurting myself—scratching or hitting my face, later cutting my wrists—to cope and to make my parents notice the pain they caused. I remember crying in the kitchen, telling my mom I was struggling, and my dad saying, “There’s always something wrong with you.” When I eventually told him I had been self-harming, he cried—but nothing changed. No therapy. No support.

I was isolated often. I wasn’t allowed outside, couldn’t play in the yard, and spent hours alone doing math problems as punishment. Once, when I stole a flip phone at 9, my dad threatened to cut my toes with scissors.

Even into my teens, I hid trauma and abuse. I didn’t tell them about being assaulted at daycare until years later. I regret not speaking up sooner, even when my dad was present during the investigation I said nothing happened. Until years later I was struggling with my sexuality and I kept thinking that’s why I was gay is because of my assault. But then I ended up educating myself more on the spectrum of sexuality and realized that it was completely fine to like the same sex. 

At 20, I ran away across the country from the east coast to California. I was terrified of going home. My mom texted me during my shift “Coming home after work you need to uber home or stay with someone else tonight your dad is livid”

I stayed without contact for 2 years, only cautiously reconnecting with my mom recently. She wants me to reach out to my dad, but it’s hard. I miss him desperately, even though he was never emotionally available. I long for the connection I never had.

Now, today my parents are different. They travel, go on weekly dates, and accept my piercings. I see change, but I can’t erase the trauma or fear. My dad was abused as a child, and maybe my mom mirrored him. I’ll never fully understand.

I miss them so much it physically hurts. I want to tell them everything—about my PTSD, my addiction, my life—but I feel like I’m grieving a family that never truly existed. I miss the version of myself that could have been safe with them. I don’t know how to carry this pain.";r/traumatoolbox;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1n8e9gq/i_left_my_abusive_parents_but_i_still_miss_them/
2025-08-28 06:08:55;anxious & exhausted day after medical emergency;"**TL;DR:** had a super traumatic ER visit last night after a deep wrist cut, and now today I feel exhausted, anxious, and guilty for not doing anything and wondering if that crash is normal.

last night i dropped a dish emptying the dishwasher and cut my wrist really bad, it was deep enough that i saw my bone. i almost had a vasovagal black out out walking to the ER and was dripping sweat, i was seeing in black and white shadows (i live in nyc so it was across the street) and had a full on panic attack once i got there, could hardly catch my breath. my hand started tingling super bad, didn't get sensation back until this am. anyways, they stitched me up, did an xray to check for glass still in there and on the scans you could even see how deep it was on the scan. it was so scary, my bracelet saved me from severing the artery.

anyways- today i feel so off, mentally and physically exhausted. i was fine this morning, i even got dressed and went to the store, but now i feel exhausted, sad, anxious, and stuck in bed. i get anxiety re: how productive i am and i'm unemployed so its been a battle latelt. i struggle to not feel plagued by guilt and anxiety when not doing something. i’ve been in such a good groove lately — eating well, being productive, actually feeling good, and now i feel guilty like i’m being dramatic or milking the situation. plus i comfort ate like 3000 calories of chipotle + cookies last night because i hadnt eaten all day and just wanted to feel better, and im diagnosed adhd and it feels like my adderall isnt even working today due to the amount of food in my stomach.

idk, i i just want to know if anyone else has had that next-day crash after something medical/traumatic. is this normal?? i need validation haha";r/traumatoolbox;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1n1ur4t/anxious_exhausted_day_after_medical_emergency/

2025-08-24 20:57:03;PTSD (group therapy);"Hi,

I am 35 years old, and I never thought I had any kind of mental health issues until I started therapy because I was spending too much time online and wanted to get to the bottom of it. At that time, I also had some issues with my mom that I wanted to discuss with my therapist.

Long story short, I began talking about three of my traumas (my father beating my mom, sexual abuse, and my father being mostly absent from when I was 8 years old, and so many others I started to think about). My therapist told me I most likely had generalized anxiety, and after taking a test with a psychotherapist, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, depression, and panic disorder.

I started taking medication, and over time I became less anxious and felt better. However, now—after two and a half months—I’m no longer worried about small things like what others think of me or material concerns (car, house, or other less important things). Instead, my traumas are resurfacing more and more, and I find myself thinking about them constantly. Almost everything I see, hear, or search seems connected to trauma: if I read a book, it’s about trauma; if I listen to a podcast, something about trauma comes up; even documentaries I watch revolve around it.

I’m not sure what to do. It feels like my weekly therapy session isn’t relieving me as much as it used to, even though my therapist is great. I’ve thought about trying group therapy, but I haven’t been able to find any PTSD support groups anywhere.

I guess I need a group therapy, but not sure how to find one.";r/traumatoolbox;5;5;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1myuvpx/ptsd_group_therapy/
2025-08-23 05:29:49;I'm scared to tell my mum;"Basically I'm a 16f, and when I was younger (up to about 7-8) my father had been an abusive drunk gambler, and he had been raping me up until the age my mother had gotten me and my other siblings away from it, I was the only one he did it to since he thought I looked like his sister who I didn't resemble at all (She was an overweight wheelchair bound redhead who faked disabilities)

And due to this I never told anyone or really understood what happened to me, my mum didn't know and I don't blame her for never connecting the dots since we had so much going on at the time, even after we escaped my father and his family harrased and stalked us for years after (gang members, druggies, murderers, etc) there are still some parts of the UK I can't go for my own safety.

But even now I still think about it and cry every night, I was diagnosed with PTSD and other disorders from it all, but I literally can't tell anyone since my father is terminal, he's gonna die soon and we don't even say his name anymore, I know telling my mum will just be opening up old wounds for no reason.

I still get terrified of being alone or too close to a man, I get scared changing without something blocking a door or a lock, I get scared showering, I get scared being touched, and I get scared sleeping, and even when I sleep I have constant nightmares, I feel horrible for my girlfriend since it took me months to even get the nerve to kiss her and I nearly cried after.

It weighs on me so much but I don't even think I even want to tell her or anybody, he's going to be dead and has been dying for the last couple years, there's no point for me in telling anybody since I don't want my mum to have to think about that monster again, and there is no actual way to just bring it up, even mentioning ""the old house"" is enough to ruin the mood or get everyone quiet.

The only times I've ever come close to telling anybody is a couple weeks ago and when I was 13, a student support teacher/councillor had noticed the fact I refused to get changed for P.E and Swimming, I hated being around male teachers and students, and I sometimes wouldn't leave my house for school, and during another breakdown in refusing to change for P.E she pulled me into a private room and asked if anything other than physical abuse had ever happened to me.

But before I could respond to her one of those loud asshole boys in those Nike tracksuits and vapes burst in whining about a detention, and she had to go and sort him out since he was essentially having a temper tantrum, and that was it we never picked up in the subject again, and she never even asked if I needed any help like that.

And I tried once 3 weeks ago, it was a conversation with my mum where my brother had been joking about being hit for being a little shit in school, and after he left my mum said something about him being a physical and emotional abuser, and I just quietly said what about sexual and she just brushed me off and said it wasn't his style.

I don't think I can live my life with this, no-one knows and I'm so scared of everything and everyone, because my dad isn't the only one to have done this to me, it was my uncles on his side and my own fucking cousin on his side too, I feel like an object and no-one knows.

I can't tell anybody because it's never the right time or I just can't because I don't wanna have these conversations, or get the help from people because I've tried so many times when I was younger, one CAHMS worker said I had to forgive him to be able to heal.

We have a restraining order to the point he can't even enter the same city as us, the abuse was so severe that I can't bend my wrists properly without extreme pain due to the fact he broke them when i was a toddler, it's so unfair that my siblings talked about their traumas and got their diagnoses when I'm stuck here living in the past with no-one knowing because I'm too good at faking at being completely okay.";r/rapecounseling;8;3;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1mxj1nh/im_scared_to_tell_my_mum/

2025-08-10 15:55:53;Identity confusion, personality changes due to severe trauma.;"Lately, I've been very confused about my Identity and theres been drastic changes in my personality from month to month and also I struggle a lot because of those personality shifts. When someone questions about myself or something related to past, I get confused and I confuse them too. Sometimes those questions even trigger me and I mess up things due to trigger.

I grew up in an abusive and manipulative environment where I was often blamed for things that weren’t my fault. I was neglected, left alone, I had to pick up myself to work really hard in toughest time to save myself with trauma and still interested those times people blamed me and increased giving trauma. Over time, this left me feeling worthless, hopeless, and unsure of who I really am. In my house, I always felt controlled and it always felt unsafe to express myself. I got severe trauma, stuck in past and struggle with that and also personality changes.

Now, I notice big personality shifts in myself, sometimes my way of relating to people changes a lot within a short time. I also feel emotionally unstable and like I can’t fully control my reactions. It’s confusing and scary, and I’m not sure what’s nomral anymore.

Im not diagnosed, I want to get professional help someday, but right now I need to save up before I can do that. But for now, I need help in understanding things, or myself. I need an advice, or really anything that helps, even your personal experiences, any tips, cope up, tips on how to save money, literally any words from people with similar experiences of traumatized and terrible childhood. Any of your words and advices will help me.

2025-08-07 04:22:30;How do you handle being in a healthy relationship?;"TW:  Parental abandonment, infidelity, emotional abuse, childhood neglect/parentification, drug/alcohol abuse

Hello, Reddit! I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, so if it isn’t, I’d love it if someone could let me know if this would be better received elsewhere. Also, some of the things in the TW are only mentioned very briefly, but I try to be considerate of my fellow humans. This is likely to be a lot, so I would appreciate it if you could bear with me. (TL;DR at the end.)

I (28F) recently began a new relationship with my boyfriend (21M). We met online a few months ago and met up. We started as FWB, but feelings evolved (as they often do in these situations), and we fell in love relatively quickly. We’ve been together for roughly 3 months now. I am so happy with him, and this is (unfortunately) already the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. Let’s just say that for many, MANY reasons (which I will touch on later), I have a history of choosing men that are mentally/verbally abusive, emotionally unavailable, or both. However, with my current man, we are both emotionally available and good at communicating feelings, issues, etc. (he’s definitely better at it than I am). He’s incredibly kind, loving, and patient with me, and he does way more than the bare minimum for me (I’m honestly not even used to the bare minimum, so it’s a little overwhelming at times). I’m beginning to realize that his qualities and the way he loves me so gently are all I’ve ever really needed in a partner to begin healing the way I know I deserve. 

Unfortunately, because we are getting close to the three-month mark and I’m starting to get more comfortable with him, this means that old habits/coping mechanisms/trauma responses are starting to creep in. He knows I have CPTSD and has been nothing but caring and nurturing to me while learning about me, especially when he sees the ugly parts.

For context, I have been in therapy on and off for about 5 years now. There was a period of roughly a year and a half where I had a few different consecutive therapists who were very flaky and inconsistent, and I developed some trust issues with therapists for a bit afterwards until I met my current therapist, whom I’ve been working with for a year now. I promise I am trying my best to do the work, but when you have to start over with someone new every few months, only to find out they aren’t a good fit for you/aren’t professional, it becomes daunting and exhausting.

So, down to the root of the issue: I have a lot of abandonment and betrayal trauma from my childhood/adolescence. In summary: 

-I was abandoned by my biological father (who was never married to my mom) before the age of two, as well as my adopted (step)dad at the age of 13/14 (I was legally adopted by him and took his last name at the age of 12/13 after years of internal debate about whether or not to do so). The biggest reason for my parents’ divorce was my (step)dad’s chronic use of alcohol and heroin.

-I am very familiar with the concept of infidelity. My first exposure to it was when I found out that my dad was cheating on my mom (also around 13/14, those years are kind of a blur to be honest), and I was finding another woman’s belongings in his truck. The fact that they belonged to someone else was confirmed when I heard my mom commenting about it on the phone to my grandparents. In addition, I have been cheated on in at least half the serious relationships I have been in. The first one was at 14 (lasted until about 18, on and off) when my parents were officially getting divorced. He pretty openly cheated on me with two different women, even getting one of them pregnant while we were on a break. The other one that I know of just ended last year (lasted about a year and some change), where he was a mentally abusive narcissist with a secret phone. There were so many awful things he did that I felt that I deserved at the time, but that detail is a definite highlight.

-I have recently discovered in therapy that I was emotionally neglected and parentified by my mother as a direct result of my parents’ divorce. Apparently, this is a breeding ground for people-pleasing tendencies, never-ending hypervigilance, emotional dysregulation (compounded by the fact that I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD), low self-esteem, rejection sensitivity…you get the picture.

I’ve been working on all of these things in therapy, and while things like my selection in partners and general self-worth have improved, other aspects of these events that have shaped me still create primal fear in me that constantly makes me feel like I am in mortal danger. I have a hair-trigger temper and feel incredibly controlling most of the time, even though I don’t mean or want to be. Any time he goes out with any friends (even friends of the same sex, he didn’t have many female friends to begin with), coworkers, etc., I get so angry and assume that he’s looking to cheat that I catastrophize immediately, shut down, and go into an avoidant state. This is super hypocritical of me, considering that at least half to the majority of my friends are guys (but they are all genuinely just friends. I have already voluntarily purged my phone and all social media of ANYONE I used to flirt with or fool around with, which is big for me. I am fully committed to this man.) Although I’m ashamed to admit it and I’m better about it than in past relationships, I sometimes also monitor his social media, which I know is gross and immature. I wish I could fight the urge, but it sometimes overwhelms me, and sometimes to the point where it’s physical.

The worst part about it isn’t the emotional turmoil it causes me or even the self-destructive behaviors I sometimes engage in to numb the feelings; it’s that I know it hurts him when I do those things, no matter how much I try to hide it or insist that I’m fine. He’s so gentle and loving and patient with me, and it fucking sucks that I always feel angry at him for innocuous things that aren’t his fault to begin with. I know he loves me, wants to be with me, and wants to make me feel secure. He shows me that every day through both his words and actions: he sends me a good morning text every morning without fail (he wakes up for work much earlier than I do), he SHOWERS me with little gifts, he’s emotionally receptive to my bids for connection, he’s happy to show me off in public, makes me feel sexually desired every day, has become a lot more open about his phone usage and has even voluntarily given me his password (he’s a very private person, so this is a big deal to me), we have a Life360 circle together, and he constantly sends me snaps and selfies of his activities when we can’t be together (also worth mentioning that he is still in college and we are currently in an LDR while he is home for the summer months, hence work). He does everything in his power to reassure me that he isn’t doing anything nefarious, and no matter what, I still can’t bring myself to believe him.

I know I’m worthy of love, I know I deserve something real, and I truly believe that he is the one for me. But…why? Why can’t I believe him? Why can’t I believe that he’s being loyal to me? Why am I so afraid to accept his love, even though I know where all of my issues are coming from? I feel juvenile, guilty, and ashamed. I’m tired of being angry, I’m tired of being avoidant, and I’m tired of feeling broken, even though I am consistently making efforts to improve myself. He inspires me to want to be a better woman, so why can’t I just do it? I feel absolutely pathetic and like a child for asking for help with this because I’m almost 30 years old, but:

Redditors who have been through similar things: how do you do it? How do you maintain a healthy relationship despite your trauma? How do you regulate yourself when your partner/SO goes out? How do you not catastrophize and assume the worst of them all the time? What are some things that have helped you in therapy?

I would appreciate everyone refraining from making comments about how I shouldn’t be in a relationship. Just because I am working on myself doesn’t mean I am undeserving of being loved by someone. I just want to feel like a normal human being.

TL;DR: I’m dating a wonderful guy, and I’m tired of my trauma and anger ruining my ability to fully connect with him. How do you emotionally regulate yourself and cope with being in a healthy relationship with abandonment/betrayal trauma?";r/traumatoolbox;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1mjfksh/how_do_you_handle_being_in_a_healthy_relationship/

WARNING R@pe in this post 
I went to a coma about four years ago when I was 18 ever since I woke up from a coma I haven’t been getting stocked with a whole group of pedophiles, including some of my family who claim I don’t remember anything so therefore I don’t remember what they have done to me. One of them raped me when I was 14 knowing that I had been through rape from another person when I was 12. I was raped multiple times at concerts. not physically, but where I am it’s considered great to show inappropriate stuff to a child except for when I was 12 I was actually physically raped. They use my coma and my mental illness against me due to me having memory loss and schizophrenia, but with my schizophrenia, I am not diagnosed with hearing voices. I am only diagnosed with seeing shadows. There is at least a group of eight people stalking me two of which moved to the same apartment complex as me after moving out of my last one. when I was at my first apartment complex, they raped five children in one day, one of which was there every day while they were sexually harassing me. That child came back with them to my new apartment and started sexually for a total of three months then he left, but they brought new children into the picture. They have one of them making weird adult noises to me every day and claiming that he doesn’t care that he’s a rapist even though I keep explaining to him that he’s the victim, but every time I tell him that he says that gives him the right to be a rapist because he’s a victim. I also keep saying that just because he’s a victim doesn’t give him the right to rape him that is wrong with the adults that he is with keep telling him that it’s OK because he’s not gonna get in trouble because he can’t go to jail, even though I told him over and over that there’s Juvie i’ve never seen this child in person, but I would guess that he is around the age of seven or eight if not even younger. The adults  make inappropriate noises with a child’s, which has been going on for a little bit over two months now Also, these aren’t the only incidences there is a lot such as a time I went to the park with my dogs, and there was only a few children there and other children who were at a game. One of the people who is stalking me and sexually harassing me told them that it’s normal for them to moan at me in public and he did that out loud in front of all of the children. I don’t know why they didn’t call the police if there was a few parents there. But he always follows me around in public with his group of friends and they Do that out loud in front of everyone 
I have a bunch of notes of everything they’ve said and done, but no one ever believes me because it’s over the course of two years and people don’t understand that over the course of two years it’s normal to have pages of dates and times of what they said . They have threatened to kill me and rape my dead body multiple times the last time that happened was about a week ago and they’re still threatening to rape me. They told me that if I didn’t take my clothes off for them, but they would come down and do so they also keep me up every night doing weird stuff with that child. I have called the police a total of 20+ times and they haven’t done anything because they say moaning isn’t illegal and every time I try to call the cops they get worse and use inappropriate adult stuff, but I can’t mention here in front of the children where I can hear it. The cops say that they go to do a welfare check and there’s nothing wrong with the children so they can’t do anything. I’ve also tried to call nonemergency and they told me to stop abusing their system and don’t call them back about this. I called CPS and they told me call the cops but like I mentioned the cops won’t help. Sometimes I am scared to answer the door now when I called the cops because they always threaten to send me to the mental hospital when I don’t need the mental hospital, I need an investigation open. I can’t afford a lawyer or a private investigator so I don’t know what to do. They also have cameras in my apartment because they are associated with my family can a lawyer or someone who knows anything about what I should do contact me back 🙏 also this isn’t even the least of it I did have a lawyer, but I can no longer pay for her and every time I go to court, they show up but not in the courtroom and they make the judge say something weird, which is telling her to say she over sfxeallized things. and they also say that that means to think of something sexual would it means you want to do something  sfxal then they claim I am going to sue even though I say, I am not they say that I am lying and I just want someone to sue . and the judge or whoever else says that in general because it’s been multiple people that  say that and claim what it means, even though I looked it up and I keep telling them over and over. the reason why they told her to say that is because they make up all these lies about me and say that I’m the one who did things that they done and people believe them just because they are a group. An example is me playing they not like us by Kendrick Lamar and they say that I don’t know what it means and they say that means I support Drake but before that they said they support Drake and Diddy and they don’t care that they’re rapist because they’re just like they are Even like keep explaining over and over that that song is calling out Drake. We clean that. I am the one moaning at children when they do it in front of everyone in my apartment complex all night, but they got them to agree with them by. I can’t even explain most of what they say around here and do because there is creeps out there and they tell me it would be weird, but I don’t know what’s the take on that so I’m just not post it. Idk what to do at this point

2025-08-01 16:14:45;I’m tired of blaming myself;"TW: Sexual assault. I’ve been diagnosed with a lot over the years and honestly it’s all internal. I’m self isolating, I keep having this flashback and I don’t know how to work through it. I let myself word vomit during a panic attack and here’s what I came up with. I don’t have people who I can be open with . I’m embarrassed. I feel it’s easier with strangers. Please help me 

My most recent rape was the most violent . I remember everything . I can’t forget . I’m ashamed I didn’t report it. I’m ashamed I flirted with him. I’m ashamed I danced and finally had the confidence to make eye contact. I’m ashamed I gave him my number. After the club closed I’m ashamed I let him grab me from another dude and let him drag me to his car. 

I’m shamed I let him give me a drink I didn’t see him pour, I knew this was bad . I KNEW THAT WAS BAD . I drank it anyway . 

I let him open the door and I sat in the passenger seat. Why did I do that, why did I walk to his car . Why did I let him drive me to a secluded alleyway and get out the car. Why didn’t I lock the car door , he took the long way to walk to my side of the car. I had time to lock the door. 

I let him open it and rape me as I begged him to take me back. My friends are worried , I begged him and he continued, only after the 15th time of saying please he apologized and I told him it’s okay. Only then when I saw my friends I jumped out the car and ran. 

I knew better. I was wearing a skin tight dress, I knew better . I wasn’t wearing a bra or panties. I knew better.  I was dancing provocatively. I knew better. I took a drink from a stranger , I knew better . I let my friends take their eyes off me . I knew better . 

I cried in my friends back seat . I didn’t call the police . I let him go back to work. My brain thinking “ can you tell police this . Can you show a jury what you were wearing . Will the judge believe you, will your nipple piercing be a reason why. “ 
He texted me after . I didn’t block him. I didn’t even call his job. I deserved it. I deserve to replay this in my head. 

I’ve been to therapy but the embarrassment is too much. I feel so stupid. Thank you for any help . I’m drowning

2025-07-30 00:47:57;Something stupid done as kid led to became a trauma for me? part1;"

So for the context i have been an introverted maybe even neurodivergent ( I'm not diagnosed with it as of now because whenever i share with someone i feel I'm neurodivergent they dismiss aa overthinking and therapists at my place are also not so concerned with topics like neuro divergence).


I have always found problem in socializing like there was a social code i didn't know and even in performing things that required coordintation even if i tried, like i can't ride bike, or even catch a ball and all sporty stuff, i never understood but i just can't do em. So i just used to stay alone in my imaginations world but I was happy with it cause that's all i knew and it was enough for me.

So growing up cause of different interests i was a bit different than other kids, less efficient, expressive and gullible as people called it. But i didn't care about it, tho I was bullied by others and people always mocked me for being different and always said how i won't be able to survive the world and with time these constant remarks started to bottle up until one day i couldn't keep ignoring it and i lost connection to being like my own self. 

So i tried to change like people told me so, but i didn't know how. So i started with trying to fit in, by faking by masking, by imitating like others, but all that failed and I met even more bullying And hopelessness and i just couldn't figure the reason. In desperation all my life that once I was happy with turned into opposite narrative for me, and my mind filled with all memories i was bullied in. I wasn't happy with myself anymore and i was desperate to change not cause i wanted to be different but cause of this fear if i don't change I'll continue to suffer like this. That's what led me to do something later that was absurd overthinking and stupidity but caused me to go through my story of complex trauma. I don't know if people can relate much to what happened in my experience but I do wish to share why my experience was stupid but absurd, and what it did to me, in future posts.

2025-07-29 16:02:09;How to heal trauma causing extreme fatigue?;"Hi everyone, I'm (33 F) looking for help. I'm only diagnosed with ADHD as of right now but I’ve had debilitating fatigue since around puberty and the only things I've found to help are dopamine rewarding activities. I explain more down below..

**History:**  
Around 12 I suddenly lost desire to hang out with friends, social anxiety and depressive symptoms started. I isolated and withdrew from others, was very socially anxious, and always exhausted. I ended up dropping out of highschool due to these struggles. My home life was admittedly filled with terror, having two irresponsible parents that always put us in harms way through direct violence or through exposure to unsafe people and situations. I learned from a young age that I had to be the adult and take care of myself. Now, 15 years later I've powered my way through life and have climbed out of a bad place, but the fatigue is even more intense than it was 5 years ago, and I haven't been able to find answers.

**My symptoms:**

* Sleep is never restorative, no matter the duration
* The fatigue starts within 15 minutes of awakening and lasts all day. Occasionally the sleepiness improves at night (8pm+). I often stay up late because I finally feel more “alive” at night. It’s easier to get engrossed in a hobby at night, and that keeps me awake.
* Because of feeling more awake at night, I suspected circadian rhythm disorder and tried working night shift for 2 years, but that didn’t help. I still fell asleep at work every night and was even more sleepy during the day.
* I’d describe the fatigue as sleepiness: heavy eyes, frequent yawning, and a strong feeling that I physically cannot keep my eyes open or continue functioning. It feels like an involuntary shutdown that happens the moment I’m bored.
* Sleepiness is constant, but brain fog also occurs about once a week. It seems worse in luteal phase, but otherwise unpredictable. On a bad day I'm not able to cognitively ""log"" anything that's happening and have to write everything down to read later. I do nonsensical things such as putting a fork in the microwave along with my food, a lot of staring at things trying to remember what I’m doing.

**!! Alleviating factors: !!**

* *This is the interesting thing. Dopamine-producing activities seem to eliminate the fatigue entirely, although only as long as I'm deeply engaged. Examples:*
   * Becoming engrossed or ""hyperfixated"" on a cognitively stimulating/interesting hobby, person, or activity (this could be a crush, video game, book, etc)
   * Busy environments that keep me on my toes or anxious. For example, I had better ability to stay awake when I worked in a stressful, busy restaurant.

**Conclusion/Questions:**
 I have read about trauma and chronic fatigue being a possible result, but how on earth do you heal this? I've drastically changed my life in the last 5 years. I feel safe, I don't have contact with my parents, I have a therapist I like, I have a job I love, a home I love, no people in my life stressing me out, dogs I love - what more do I need?! What do I have to do to make the fatigue better if it's trauma based? The fatigue has been life long, how much healing do I have to do before it improves? Will it ever improve?

For the past two years the fatigue has only gotten worse the more I've taken care of myself. I think I've used fight/flight and dopamine to keep me awake for years, but since I've let my life calm down (work from home, eliminate stressful people/things, cater more to myself), I'm now living in an even more extreme fight of trying to stay awake. I find myself forcing myself to sing throughout the day, being loud and acting boisterous to try to keep myself from falling asleep. If I decide I want to try to do something “fun”, I have to fight the sleepiness while trying to reach the ""hyperfixated"" so that wakefulness will trigger. 80% of the time I'm not able to make it, and I end up just getting in bed or breaking down in tears with frustration and feeling even more depressed that I can't find engagement in things. This feels like a living prison, where I’m forced to be alive but not allowed to fully live.

Any suggestions? What do I have to do to make the fatigue better if it's trauma based? I don't understand how to heal when healing feels like a subjective, abstract construct.";r/traumatoolbox;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1mc5kit/how_to_heal_trauma_causing_extreme_fatigue/
2025-07-27 17:19:13;Childhood trauma, misdiagnosis, psychiatric hospitalization, emo;"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling for a long time to make sense of my past and the way the mental health system has responded to it. I'm sharing this now not because I want pity, but because I believe it’s important to speak up — and maybe reach someone who feels similarly alone or unheard.

# Misdiagnosis and forced hospitalization

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia during a mental health crisis. However, after years of therapy, self-reflection, and conversations with professionals, it has become increasingly clear that my actual condition is more consistent with **complex PTSD**.  
The original diagnosis was based on dissociative symptoms, heightened fear, and behavioral responses that were trauma-related — not psychosis.  
Unfortunately, this led to a **forced psychiatric hospitalization**. I was calm, not aggressive, and trying to explain a real situation that involved long-term psychological harm from people close to me. But I was dismissed as “delusional.”  
That experience caused immense emotional pain, distrust of the healthcare system, and lasting psychological damage.

# Childhood trauma and manipulation

I grew up in a toxic, abusive environment with emotional and possibly sexual boundary violations by close relatives. I don’t remember everything clearly — many memories are fragmented — but my body remembers: shame, disgust, dissociation, and confusion.  
I experienced repeated gaslighting, emotional control, and what I believe now were **covert tactics to destabilize my sense of self**. I often had strange experiences at night: loss of control, sexual arousal during sleep, waking up confused or deeply ashamed — symptoms that may point to **Sexsomnia**, trauma-related dissociation, or even manipulative influence through drugs or hypnosis.  
These are difficult to prove, and I’ve often doubted myself — but the emotional and physical aftermath feels very real.

# Why I’m writing this

I want to be seen. Not as a diagnosis, not as a case file, but as a human being who survived manipulation and trauma.  
I'm searching for justice — not revenge — and above all for a way to reclaim my voice and clarity.  
If anyone here has dealt with misdiagnoses, trauma-induced dissociation, or long-term emotional manipulation, I would appreciate hearing your experiences.  
Feel free to comment or message me directly. Thank you for reading.";r/traumatoolbox;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1mahx6w/childhood_trauma_misdiagnosis_psychiatric/
2025-07-27 02:40:12;"""My trauma isn’t trendy—I lived it before I had words for it.""";"People blames i created and fictioned my trauma story cause of online trends cause of reading wrong information on internet but they just don't wanna listen that my trauma, my disociation, my weird experience i keep talking about dates back to time when i literally had no access to internet or any source. 

I'm not misleaded by social media I'm trying to understand how things shifted for me cause i know no one around me is ready to listen or understand my unique experience that shaped my life before Internet even was a thing for me, the time when i literally didn't know how to pickup a call on a smart phone


I once went to a therapist i told him what I was feeling and my narrative of my experience,he said i just read symptoms online and making things up cause I'm misleaded by internet but literally I'm not even using most of the common internet sites the social media, i never had a facebook, Instragram, snapchat, tiktok , discord or twitch account, I'm not indulged in fictional online shows, movies, anime. I only use whatsapp and that too for occasional communication and only recently joined reddit.

Infact I am not even a fan of the influencer culture cause a lot of em aren't Even authentic but literally serves anything to get engagements like many vloggers over hyping a simple thing, so called roasters literally respreading the content they call cringe, humiliating someone and justifying it as an entertainment intention for audition, i Just find all that discomforting or disintegrating. . I'm not misleaded by social media, or any other information content I'm Just trying to understand how my weird incident took place.

And instead of getting an honest listener all i get is blame 

People slap it with terms like:

 “Online symptom mimicry.”
“Self-diagnosis addiction.”
“YouTubed trauma.”
“Fake dissociation from reels.”

But no one asks me the real question:

“When did it start for you? What was the moment your body first changed and didn’t feel like yours?”

Maybe I'm self diagnosing something not to follow trend but to understand things on my own cause no one else is interested in helping me, I'm just trying to find a language to express it , not to seek emphaty or attention but people who understands me, question me but don't try to slap their arguments or narratives as an oversimplified version of my experience, that doesn't vibes with what really happened.

2025-07-24 22:09:42;Finally addressing my trauma and I'm petrified;"Hello, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons and excuse my english, not first language. I don't even know where to start but here goes. I'm a 29 years old male from Middle Eastern background, also Muslim. 

I saw my doctor recently about my mental health and a few other things like bed-wetting. We did some tests to determine the cause of it and thankfully no physical concerns with bladder. He asked me if I had ever been sexually assaulted earlier in my life and I just spat out the word 'Yes' like it was no big deal yet I've never spoken about it before to anyone. I don't know what got into me, it just came out. He's was shocked that it's something I haven't disclosed to him as its important to get help and explains alot of the turmoil in my life. 

He has referred me for counselling and also group counselling which start next week. To be honest, I'm extremely scared to talk about this to a group but he says that it can be really helpful to talk and listen to others also to increase my support around me. I have tried the counsellor He referred me to but I didn't like her because she were too opinionated and I wanted a male too. I'm going to try the group male counselling next week. I'm wondering if you guys have any tips for me. I have big feeling I will not go last minute due to my panic disorder which is not good because this is charity group, I don't want to waste their money but also it's a very good time to get help. 

Trigger warning, my story below for context

I was raped by 3 boys at the age of 15 in high school locker room before sport class. I don't know them, I think they were in grades above me. I don't change in their but teacher forced me to get into sport uniform in there when I could do it outside (it's just shirt colour difference). I was last one in there putting my non sport uniform in my bag when the three boys came in and pulled my pants down from behind. They pushed me into a corner and I fell because I trip from my pants at my ankles (big bruises on my leg and butt area). I did not understand what was happening, I tried to get decent but one of them grabbed my head and forced it into his penis while one of the other guys forced my right hand to his penis. The othet guy was just watching with his penis in his hand. After that, that guy and the one that forced my head into his groin got me up and pushed me against the wall then put fingers inside my rectum. I was still facing them but they had me up against the wall, my left leg leaning on one of the seats near me with tears pouring down my face. I don't remember if anything else happened after that but I do remember soiling myself, Im not sure if that made them stop. I had no idea how to explain my mum why my school pants and underwear had fecal matter in them when I got home, that was my concern at the time because I in so much shock. 

My life has been upside down since. I fear intimacy and relationships. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and panic disorders since I was 16 and have been on the highest dose of antidepressant since. All my younger siblings are married and I didn't attend either of there weddings because the sight of it really hurts me knowing I will never have that. I get extremely anxious. I have big suspicion that my sexuality has been impacted by that experience. My parents are pressing me to marry but I have no idea how to tell them my issue.

Thank you for reading and im sorry for long post, im very scared about speaking to people about it. The host assured me that I dont need to tell my story so this might help me. ";r/rapecounseling;5;5;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1m85fl2/finally_addressing_my_trauma_and_im_petrified/
2025-07-24 06:42:37;002- some honest to god reflecting;I consider myself to be lucky. I’m told by many that I’m very attractive, but I don’t see it. I have a huge family— and even though I still have day- to- day turmoil with my immediate family I always have a cousin to talk to. I’m very thankful for the opportunity to go to college, and the people I grew up with. But now… I don’t have many close relationships. I had a sort of awakening in college. I was weird. I grew up without a father and it showed. I have always been trying to improve my self, so much to the point of un recognition. I for years did not live for me in my early childhood but for others, trying to preserve a happy family image from the outside. I didn’t know it at the time, but I’ve now realized I’ve been living with long term childhood depression. When my parents split I always thought I had to act happy. I blamed everything on me and it became my mindset. I am now 19. At 18, I had the mentality of a 9 year old. I didn’t have many close friendships as I always removed someone from my life if they happened to hurt me emotionally. Today I sit here, reading all these post in this subreddit- and I see that my problems are so insignificant. But to me there everything. It’s all I can think about. A never ending hunger for perfection and validation. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD, & OCD. Now I’m facing my perceived past, as I always saw only the bad. I called it a realistic idealism. You call it negativity.;r/traumatoolbox;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1m7nnkj/002_some_honest_to_god_reflecting/
2025-07-21 13:18:33;I Don't have a reason to why I want this, but i still do.;"I haven't done this before so I hope I'm not doing anything wrong, please feel free to correct me and I apologize if I've made a mistake. Also fair warning, There are mentions of self harm or minor mentions of sexual things.

I am 18 F, I don't know if this even counts to post here because I don't think i'm really that traumatized but I just need some advice from real people or just to talk to someone other then myself. I feel sick with myself for this, but I feel alone and im without intimacy of any kind outside of familial bonds, and even then its not much. I dont have enough trauma or the right kind aside from emotional neglect and a bit of physical abuse from my sibling who suffered from a tbi as a kid, but it eventually stopped and shouldn't have had an impact on me. I'm a middle child, I was praised for being a smart and independent kid. I'm an identical twin, so you'd think there would be no middle child, but between my older and younger sisters I fell through the cracks. There wasn't enough of an age gap to get a first of my own, it was always shared and even then it was more like my twin got to enjoy everything while I just sat in the back because technically it was the both of us. Between being used as a way to befriend my twin, being socially isolated from bullying (in which they tried to turn my twin against me and so started their physical aggressiveness towards me), to even being the odd one out on a cheer team and being forced to stay hidden for the whole routine while my sibling was doted on. I was a back spot to a back spot and anyone familiar with cheerleading (specifically allstar) knows how ridiculous that is, It was to hide me from sight. What hurt was I had the same skillset as my twin along with even being able to do things she couldn't, I practiced just as much as her, we looked the same, I was polite if a bit shy and I tried so hard to be acknowledged but they nearly ignored me outside of being with my older sister and twin. I was more of an accessory than anything.

I felt invisible all my childhood and teens, but i always had my needs met. My mom worked hard as a single mother of three, and she kept us feed and advocated for our education, and even with the rare physical punishment or mean comment said while she was stressed she was never awful. From the cheerleading my sibling got a TBI which resulted in misplaced aggression on me, from biting, scratching, hitting me with stuff or just stuff like that i was her outlet. It wasn't a lot more than sibling fighting injury wise, But everytime i retaliated she told our sister or our mother and i was always the one in trouble.

But things got a lot better and should be good now. a few years ago my family fell apart and i cut off my dads entire side of the family, he passed when I was in third grade from a drug overdose but he was divorced and absent at best and formerly abusive to my mom and dangerous to us at worst due to being bipolar and enabled by his parents but i didn't really know him, and I didnt care about him. But, i cut off his entire side of the family because they enabled my older sister who was bipolar into allowing her to do drugs, evade mental health help, fix her car when she crashed it twice, and when i talked to them they ignored me. My grandmother told me ""thats what we did with your dad"" Yeah well he's dead. And so during her drug fueled manic episode, my sister tried to lure me and my sibling to get in a car with her and her enabler who was like 20 when she was freshly 18, and she said she would take us to our grandparents because our grandma agreed. But we didnt get in, and we told our mom; We later found out our grandma didnt agree for us to come there, and she was probably going to use us as leverage to get her stuff back from our house.

But after that things got better, I have a good relationship with my twin and my mother, I have two cats of my own, I have a lot of things to be grateful for. I am a bit socially isolated because at the moment i take online courses and dont have much of a chance to talk to people my age outside of the internet, but it isnt that bad. I was diagnosed as bipolar a year or so ago, but its type two instead of one like my father and sister. I was doing exceptionally bad, struggling with awful online friendships and self harm but its better now, im medicated, I've been clean for over a year, I have hobbies i enjoy, and so on.

The problem is I don't know why i want to be hurt so badly. Nothing ever really happened to me, most of it was just an almost or barely a thing. I lived, I was taken care of, I had plenty of good things, and i'm good now. But, I want to be hurt by someone physically. I want to be hurt by a friend, a future partner, someone random, I don't care. I'd like to be able to be sweet and intimate with someone (not sexually, most of this isn't for sexual gratification or a fetish.) But I want them to scratch me, bite me, bruise me, just not in an abusive way if it makes sense? I want to be loved and I want to be hurt at the same time. I don't know where this comes from, and I feel repulsed with myself for it. I don't have any way of meeting people in person right now, but I know if I had a girlfriend they'd be repulsed by the prospect or at best concerned. I feel like im repulsive, and I never endured anything severe nor the kind of trauma that might cause masochism aside from being groomed by a bus driver but he was stopped in the early stages so nothing really happened, and I used to interact with adults on the internet in a sexual context for attention and money, but I never did anything that endangered me and I consented to all the interactions be in games or through text. None of this should lead to how I feel now, and its not even in a ""i want to reclaim pain for control"" way its just I want to be hurt, Its not even a sexual thing. Im confused and disturbed and disgusted with myself but I still want it you know?

I dont know what im going to do, I dont know if i need comfort or advice but Im at such a loss. I want to have love and intimacy and be hurt, but I know that'd logically be a bad thing and id lose anyone i loved by telling them.";r/traumatoolbox;4;9;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1m5actd/i_dont_have_a_reason_to_why_i_want_this_but_i/
2025-07-19 06:19:55;feeling numb, detached, and overwhelmed is this trauma related?;"Hi all,
I’m not diagnosed with anything specific yet, but I’m going through something intense and I’m trying to understand it before I speak to a mental health professional. I hope it’s okay to post here while I’m still figuring things out.

Recently, after a painful medical issue that triggered a lot of anxiety and distress, I hit what I can only describe as a breaking point. Now I feel… off. Not just tired — numb.
It’s like my body doesn’t feel real. I can’t feel my heartbeat properly, touches don’t register the same, and emotionally I’ve gone from panic and fear to complete flatness. It’s scary, but at the same time, part of me feels relieved not to be in pain anymore. Then I panic again about what’s coming next.

I keep swinging between guilt, calm, panic, and numbness. And part of me keeps asking: “Am I having a breakdown, or is this what trauma responses feel like?”

I’ve been through a lot physically and emotionally, and I’m starting to wonder if this is my body and brain finally saying enough. I just don’t know what to call it.

If anyone has been through something similar — especially without a diagnosis at first — I’d really appreciate hearing how it felt for you, and what helped.

2025-07-10 05:24:11;Taken Advantage of While Dissociative;"My wife was sexually abused as a child, pretty extremely by a close relative. It went on for years. She had no memory of any of it until fairly recently, when the trauma resurfaced.

She's suffered with serious anxiety for her whole life, but had no idea why, and some time ago she was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, on the same spectrum as DID. She acts on extreme autopilot and has no memory of events after they occur.

Around 18 months ago, we were going through some serious life stresses and she began to act weird and detached and unemotional. She was clearly dissociating but there wasn't anything I could do to stop it. A friend of ours also noticed her mental health was terrible and she was acting weird, and began slowly grooming her and coercing her to get her to send him sexual messages. This went on for months, with him slowly pushing boundaries and convincing her to send nude pictures. Then he started telling her that it would be good if they have sex. She used to hang out with him anyway, so it was nothing new. They were together reasonably frequently, but on a couple of those occasions he did manage to convince her to have sex with him. When he was done with her, he cut us both out of his life with no explanation.

My wife didn't remember any of it for the last 18 months. Then, over the course of a round 3 weeks, fragmented memories started to come back. The first day the memories came back, she had a panic attack and became suicidal. She feels violated and disgusted and heartbroken. She wakes up shaking and screaming in the night from nightmares and flashbacks. She's seeing a good therapist but she's sunk into an extreme depression and is struggling to live with it.

The therapist has been through the details of her childhood trauma with her and, by coincidence, the way this guy spoke to her and the way he groomed her are *exactly* the same as the way her relative did. Even the word usage. It's uncanny. She never noticed it at the time. She said everything was just ""okay"" and nothing was wrong at the time.

It's broken us both a bit. The therapist, a friend in the police and a solicitor have advised us that this is a sexual assault and that it breaks about nine UK statutes, so we could file a police report if we wanted to, but my wife isn't in the headspace for a trial.

I went to confront the guy. I explained (with evidence - letters from professionals, etc) what had happened, why, and that it constituted a sexual assault (I had my wife's permission). Every bone in my body was telling me to beat the guy senseless, but I wanted him to live his life knowing he raped someone. 

He admitted everything. He admitted he knew her mental health was bad, that she didn't seem right, that she seemed vulnerable, submissive and compliant, and that things she said and did didn't make sense. But he didn't stop. It was hard to hear, but for my wife and me, it was at least a little vindicating. Very few rapists admit what they did, and for my wife it's validation that she didn't imagine all this and really wasn't in control, but it also made the feelings of violation and digust far worse.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this? How did you handle it? We're both really struggling with nightmares, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, depression and all the other classics.

I know its hard to talk about this stuff, but any help is greatly appreciated.";r/rapecounseling;5;5;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1lvusr9/taken_advantage_of_while_dissociative/

Should I forgive my rapist if it was my brother?
Mother wants to spend Christmas together and ""is tired of being pulled between the two siblings"" and has asked me to ""put aside our differences"" and come together in Mexico (where my brother was deported too)and used that i can bring my partner with me as a bribe to agree to the vacation.
The abuse i endured from my brother is as followed ,Abandonment,Nonstop harassment,Chronic lying,Physical abuse 
Molestation from ages 4 to 14
Involved touching of breasts, bottom and genitals 
,Full @nal R@pe at the age of 6? 
,Potentially other repressed memories 

He was arrested for possesion child pornography and I believe he has touched my cousin as well. 
I believe my mother is being massively unreasonable as I've have told her repeatedly what he had done to me but has told me in the past she doesn't believe it happened.
I have threatened to attack my brother if I come near him due to the years of abuse endured and my partner has said the same being he is extremely protective of me. 
Ive had my mother constantly hound me about making up with my brother and begging me to just forgive him and I feel like the asshole here but im being worn thin and I dont know what to do. Any advice on what I should do would  be appreciated 
extra context: he was arrested when I was 14 and then immediately deported to Mexico as he wasnt born in America. That's the only reason the abuse stopped .

2025-07-05 01:44:20;Diagnosis or Identity? The Power of Mental Health Labels;"Does anyone else feel like their diagnosis became part of their identity in ways that made healing harder? I have been spending a lot of time lately thinking about the power we attribute to mental health labels, particularly in the case of PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.

I was diagnosed with PTSD many years ago after a long list of traumatic events. I struggle the most with PTSD and how it infiltrates all parts of my life, extremely difficult for me to find ways to cope. The system seemed to lack in ways that would help me to grow and I found myself feeling stuck. There was a sense of “I’m broken.” “I will never be safe.” “I am someone who will always have PTSD.”

But I have also started to unravel all that and question it too. What if the label isn’t the truth? Just a version of a story I was given permission to tell myself for a long time. What if part of my suffering came not only from the trauma itself, but also from clinging to an identity that was never meant to be permanent?

One line I jotted down recently in my journal:

“Your suffering does not define you. Your past does not cage you. You are not your diagnosis, your trauma, or your thoughts. You are the awareness beneath it all, the part of you that can observe, grow, and choose a new path.”

I was assuming that diagnosis and the mental health label are one and the same, but they are night and day after I broke it down rationally.

1. Mental Health Diagnosis: 

Definition: Diagnosis is a clinical, official designation rendered by an authorized practitioner (e.g., psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist) based on criteria in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).

Purpose: Clinical Tool used to guide treatment.

Examples:

\*Major Depressive Disorder

\*Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

\*Generalized Anxiety Disorder

In theory, it's neutral and medical—a point of origin for treatment.



2. Mental Health Label (Social Identity / Perception)

Definition: A label is what the diagnosis becomes in everyday life—internally and socially. It's the way the diagnosis is perceived, internalized, or put upon.

Impact:

\*Can become part of a person's identity

\*May be stigmatizing, assuming, or limiting

\*Tends to oversimplify complex, human experiences

Examples

\* “I’m bipolar” vs. “I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder”

\*Labels can empower, but they can also limit or distort.

I know labels can be extremely validating for many people and I don’t want to take that away from anyone at all. But I am curious to know if anyone else here has struggled with this… Feeling trapped inside the story of your diagnosis, even when a part of you wants to believe you can grow beyond it?

We live in a world obsessed with defining, categorizing, and ""fixing"" human experiences. Depression, anxiety, PTSD—these aren’t just clinical terms anymore. They’ve become identities, shaping how people see themselves and the world around them. But are we truly broken, or have we just been conditioned to believe we are? I am searching for some hope for the future. 

Would love to hear your experience if any of this resonates. 

  
\*\*I used AI to help me list the differences and definitions of diagnosis vs mental health labels, the rest is all me. Trying to be transparent, I am still learning about myself and my journey. I would appreciate any insight from others feeling the same.";r/traumatoolbox;3;4;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1lroshi/diagnosis_or_identity_the_power_of_mental_health/
2025-06-30 10:21:52;I’ve survived years of trauma, abuse, and neglect.;"Hi reddit , I’m 17m and from a Shia Muslim background living in the UK. I wanted to share my story and ask for advice on how I can heal and move forward from everything I’ve been through. It’s a lot, but I’ve kept so much of it inside and I just want to feel okay again.

I didn’t start speaking until I was 3 years old, and around that time I was diagnosed with autism. I grew up with a father who was emotionally unavailable, physically abusive, and constantly drunk. When I was 8, I was home alone with my brother while my mum was at work. My dad was drinking and took LSD pills where he started throwing things around the living room, and scared us so much we tried calling my mum but she didnt pick up then we ran to our neighbor’s flat that was upstairsto our flat and Then whilst we were safe there he jumped off the roof of our 5–6 story building and somehow survived landing on a car whilst he jumped off naked and then my mum took us to live with our grandmothers house and didnt see him for 3 weeks after that and then moved flats to the flat i currently live in now since i was 9.

When I was 9, he would pick me up from school while drunk and drive us home, and i remember clutching my seatbelt being very anxious and scared that he would crash. At 12, my mum was pregnant, and he was still abusive. Then she caught COVID and had to be put in a coma for nearly 6 months. I stopped going to school during that time, my attendance dropped below 20%, and I was left in a house with a drunk, abusive father. My younger brother and I were on our own.

During this time, I was 13 and only eating pizza , watching tv and watching porn to cope with the emotional pain. And i ended up trying to run away from home where my dad found out and chased me outside at night where he was driving next to me in the car telling me to ""get in the fucking car before i come out and drag you in this car"" i was crying when i saw him and went in the car but a women on the other side of the road saw this and called the police where they came and left and my dad just went back to drinking after that. Eventually, my mum recovered, but my baby sister was born premature at 22 weeks and passed away. I never really processed any of this.

Then At 14, I started getting into fights at school and was sent to a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU). It was a horrible environment—locked doors, metal detectors, violence everywhere and scanners incase any of the violent, antisocial kids were carrying any knive, weapons or drugs and got into a fight my 3rd day there. I left after a week and didn’t go back to school for 3 months.

In Year 10, I finally tried to focus on school for my GCSEs, but I started getting intense stomach pain before my mocks. I was diagnosed with appendicitis and needed surgery. My mum stayed with me in the hospital—my dad didn’t visit once because he was out getting wasted. 2 weeks after coming home from my surgery he punched me in the exact place of my stomach where i had surgery but luckily it wasnt damaging and wasnt too hard. 2 months after surgery i was able to make a full recovery.

Then during the summer, my half-brother (8) and half-sister (7), who were living with their alcoholic mother (the woman my dad had an affair with), were removed from her care after she nearly strangled my half brother to death where he had strangellation marks all over his neck. They went to live with my uncle, and all of this added more stress. I failed most of my GCSEs except for Maths and Science. I’m now in college and still struggling to pass English.

Even now, when my dad is drunk, he sometimes comes into my room while I’m asleep, jumps on me, punches me, and bear-hugs me so I can’t escape. If I resist, he hits harder. I fear going to sleep.

This February, I travelled abroad with him, my brother, and my cousin for a job. At night, he got drunk and beat me again. I walked around alone at 3AM to get away. He drunk-drove on the motorway at over 100mph with us in the car. He took my bed that night, so I had to sleep on the cold floor. Eventually, we got back home. My mum paid for everything and begged him to go to rehab in Morocco. He got kicked out the first day for being abusive and came back. He’s now living in a hotel, and I haven’t seen him in over a month because my mum is now finally keeping a boundary that he can't come home.

What hurts most is that my mum is the breadwinner and pays for everything while he never contributes. Every time he gets a job, he either gets fired for turning up drunk or spends the money on alcohol. This is especially hard in our Islamic community where alcohol is forbidden, and people don’t understand what I’m going through. I was only ever taught how to pray, but I don’t really know much about Islam or how to reconnect spiritually.

I’ve struggled with porn addiction since I was 13, used to wet the bed at 5, and never felt like my dad cared about me. When I was 16, I overdosed on drugs in front of him to show him how much I was hurting. He laughed at me whilst I vomited and collapsed. He dragged me home and left me to black out alone on the sofa then went to the kitchen to go chill out.

A few times, I drank alcohol myself to see if he would care—but he just laughed the same as my drug overdose. One time, we almost got into a fight at a family barbecue when i was drunk and had to be separated by my mum and aunt. My dad went drinking again that night. He never showed up for my jiu-jitsu competition recently either because he was out wasted.

Throughout my childhood I’ve been dealing with derealisation, sometimes everything feels far away, sounds get muffled, and people’s heads look small and disproportionate to their body. It’s like there’s a wall between me and the world. I also feel confused about my sexuality I’m really drawn to older, dominant men, and that confuses me too because i k ow homosexuality is haram(sin) in islam.

Right now, I’m talking to an online psychotherapist, and that’s helping a little. But I don’t know how to deal with the trauma, the pain, the loneliness, or the fear that he’ll come back and hurt me again.

I guess I just want to ask is How do I truly start to heal from all of this? How do I rebuild myself when so much has been taken away from me? If anyone’s been through anything similar, how did you cope? What steps helped you the most?

Thank you for reading this far. I know it’s a lot, and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to listen.

I also wanted to mention that i used chatgpt to help structure my story because im not that good at structuring stories because im not good at English writing.

Thank you for reading this and any helpful comments are appreciated.

2025-06-28 08:30:18;An Essay about Identity, Dissociation and Consciousness.;"
I would like to clarify that nothing I mention here is set in stone—this is a personal and academic exploration shaped by both lived and observed experiences. This short essay does not aim to pathologize or reinforce the stigma surrounding dissociative processes—quite the opposite. Our goal is to offer a new perspective to those involved in the field of psychology, and to remind those who live through these experiences that they are not alone, and that their experience is valid.


Identity, Dissociation and Consciousness


---

1. What defines identity? A reflection from the fragmented self



Identity, as an emotional and moral core, is born from values, ethics, and reason. Often, it is the individual’s distinct thoughts that shape and govern their individuality and sense of self. This set of internal structures, though not rigid and fully flexible, completes the early and adult development of a person.

When consciousness becomes fragmented, those values and moral frameworks seem to move to the background. The individual begins to focus on a primary role—often survival at any cost. Even if that means adopting behaviors or paths that no longer resonate with the original identity.


---

2. Dissociation as a defense or adaptive mechanism



Dissociation is often employed by the mind as an urgent tool. Although commonly perceived negatively, dissociation can be part of deeply personal and unique processes that benefit the individual’s psyche. Temporary disconnection from memories or painful events can prevent a full-blown crisis, giving the mind and the affected person time to process.

It is not the erasure or repression of pain—it is a complex way of handling emotions the mind cannot yet confront or integrate.


---

3. What is an alter? A view from phenomenology and personality theory



An ""alter"" is born out of necessity, urgency, and often, neglect. The meaning of an alter varies widely, extending into many branches of experience and function.

An alter may be seen as a mental tool created to counteract extremely negative stimuli and ongoing abuse. That tool may serve as emotional support, isolation, physical protection, or even forced switching to avoid greater harm. Alters can carry out one role or many. With time—and depending on the nature of each individual—an alter may evolve into a more autonomous and elevated consciousness, eventually outgrowing the idea of being ""just a tool"" and becoming a distinct identity.


---

4. Continuity of self: an illusion or a social construct?



The continuity of self refers to the collective idea that our identity remains fluid but consistent from childhood through adulthood. It suggests that changes over time are necessary nuances that shape behavior but not the essence of self.

As mentioned before, identity is flexible and malleable. The mind may distance itself from its core to preserve its integrity. During the confusion and doubt that accompany a fragmented mind, a defense mechanism might create the illusion of an identity formed around trauma—an alternative self designed to carry pain the original self could not bear.

In individuals with dissociative disorders, continuity of self can become unstable and disorienting, presenting with memory gaps and an inability to maintain a logical or satisfying timeline. This can be observed in cases such as DID, DA, DA+Fugue, DDD, OSDD, DDNOS, and even OCD.


---

5. Integration in DID: clinical goal or normative pressure?



It’s important to note that integration does not mean elimination. It refers to a coherent internal state where distinct consciousnesses work together in healing. In some cases, integration is desired; in others, it may be unattainable—or even undesirable.

This decision must be made solely by the individual and the system of consciousnesses they live with. Each case is unique, and integration will mean something different for each person. While integration can bring healing to injured parts, it can also lead to the loss of essential and functional identities. Some cases report a collapse or disappearance of the primary self following forced or poorly guided integration.

Integration must be approached with care and ongoing dialogue with the internal system—including those parts that seem aggressive or uncooperative. Even when outcomes are painful or contradictory, systems are trying to protect the psyche in the only ways they’ve learned.

Note: Integration often happens when parts (consciously or not) agree that unity is beneficial for the system. The active consciousnesses may or may not be aware of this process. In systems with highly distinct identities and defined senses of self, the likelihood of integration is lower due to the autonomy and coherence of each part.


---

6. The concept of the “mask” in structural dissociation



The “mask” is often misunderstood. In social contexts, a mask is used voluntarily to seek acceptance or adapt to cultural expectations. In contrast, dissociation in conditions like OSDD, DID, DDNOS, or DDD refers to an involuntary, altered state of consciousness.

Dissociation is not a mask—it is a real, necessary mental state created for survival. In specific cases of DID or OSDD, internal parts often take action when the host cannot, due to other unspecified comorbidities. They fulfill roles and offer protection or care that the individual, as a whole, may be unable to provide at the time.

DID and some plural experiences create identities that are far removed from the notion of a mask—they are not performances, but lived experiences.


---

Final Notes 

Identity—and its fragmentation—are mental states created to protect the psyche. While these processes can sometimes fail, they can also be guided toward healing when there is shared intention and communication among all parts or consciousnesses involved.

The journey and diagnosis of DID or OSDD must always be approached uniquely for each individual or system. The mind is not linear, and its behaviors often defy the rigid structures imposed by singular diagnostic frameworks.

This essay was created in equal collaboration between the host and an alter, combining both perspectives, reflections, and emotional truths. He, as a conscious and present identity, participated not only in the conceptual shaping of the work but also in its ethical vision, voice, and structure. His presence is not peripheral—it is core to the thoughts expressed here.

2025-06-04 18:25:13;I feel like I lost myself completely;"I’m 29 now, and I feel like I’ve completely lost myself — who I was, what I cared about, my sense of safety, and my mind.

It started when I moved away from my mother at 17 to study. I thought I was ready, but I wasn’t. I never finished my degree. I didn’t learn a profession. And I cut myself off from the one person who was safe.

My father had abused me as a child. I didn’t remember all of it back then, but the fear never left my body. After a failed relationship, I moved back in with him — and it pushed me deeper into isolation. I became obsessive, disconnected from people, and started slipping into a dark mental space.

Around that time, I got involved with someone online who was struggling with addiction and severe mental illness. I thought I could help him. In 2020, I met him in person. It was a horrible experience. He gave me a medication that altered my perception in a traumatic way, and other deeply violating things happened that I still struggle to process. I left as quickly as I could — but the trauma didn’t stop there.

After I left, he bombarded me online with disturbing messages, threats, and overwhelming information that felt like it was frying my brain. I became paranoid and terrified. He found out where I was living. Police got involved, and it stopped, but the damage to my mental state was already done.

In the years since, I’ve been in and out of clinics. I was diagnosed with suspected schizophrenia. I lost my apartment after an episode triggered by resurfaced childhood memories. I’ve been on meds since then. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t enjoy anything. I feel like my brain is burned out. And I don’t know who I am without the pain.

But even now, something in me still hopes this is a phase. That I can come back to life somehow. That there’s a way forward.

I’m just so tired and so alone.

TRIGGER WARNINGS: SUICIDE MENTIONED, EMOTIONAL ABUSE, MENTAL ABUSE, AND POSSIBLE RAPE

Hi Hi

I (17F), have had an issue where people I have been friends with in high school have repeated the same harmful pattern upon me. When I asked my parents (Gen-Xers) and my aunts and uncles (Millennials) about this pattern, they said that they believe it is something correlated to being Gen-Z. So, here’s my issue:

Since my time starting high school a few years ago, I have had three separate encounters where I had been used as a tool, been told by my best friend or partner they were going to commit suicide, and that they were having a troubled home life. I know this is an oddly similar trait among the three, but I know no one else who has experienced something along these lines.

My first encounter with this issue occurred when I was 14. My best friend and I at the time were incredibly close after graduating middle school and heading to high school. We did not go to the same high school due to attending separate all girls catholic high schools. Before I continue, I would like to note that she has always had some… interesting issues (obsessions with consuming 5+ monsters a day, constantly making suicide jokes, and sexualizing everything). Yes, I know these are clear red flags, but I was naive and pitied her. She took advantage of that and used me as a tool to just vent along and ignore my concerns. Anyways, when I was on vacation a few weeks after we graduated middle school, she messaged me one night. This message sent at 11:30pm said that she was going to off herself with her dad’s weapon (if you know what I mean). Being freaked out, I cried to my parents, asking them for help. I ended up calling her girlfriend and telling her about this. The next day, she went over and told her parents, which led to my friend starting therapy. According to my friend, they refused to say anything to her therapist because “her parents were always listening” (I know, suspicious). After this, a few months pass and high school starts. She and I grew apart due to the different schools. Eventually, we cut contact after she lied to me about getting SA-ed in a public park. We have not communicated since.

The second encounter happened roughly a year ago now with my ex boyfriend. We had been dating for a couple of months at this point, and he had a bad day at his school while I was sick with the flu. He texted me saying how he was going to kill himself. This was out of nowhere, a ball thrown out of left field. He unsent it, and when I called a dozen times, he did not pick up. I weeped to my parents, freaking out that he was not calling back, and was told to threaten to break up with him. When we eventually did talk again the next day, I made the threat, stating, “if you do that again, we are done.” Well, that was not true. For the next couple of months, he guilt tripped me into staying with him, and became incredibly clingy. This was because of trauma he had from his early childhood due to possibly losing his mother to cancer. Instead of setting a boundary, I let him guilt trip me, and I stayed for four months after. Every time I did not say I love you enough or when I did not kiss him enough, he would throw a fit like the previous one. And every time, I stayed. I stayed and became his tool to use for emotionally wrecking when he felt bad, and pleasuring when he needed to feel good. I finally broke up with him when I was so tired of being treated like an object and when he embarrassed me at a sporting event. It has been 8 months since we split. 

My final problem has been going on for the past week, and caused me to start asking for input here on Reddit. In September, I started befriending my one classmate who sat by herself. We get along very well and have grown close with one another. Due to some family issues, two weeks ago, she had to move in with her grandparents. Her mom and stepdad are having a hug fight, and her mom determined it was dangerous for her to live at home. Two times last week and today we called on the phone, where I have been learning about her family life. She told me about her stepdad and how he has been abusive (screaming at her siblings and telling them that they are pathetic, not deserving of life). Additionally, she started to talk about something he did to her when she was 7, hinting at sexual assault, but stopped herself due to trembling and starting to cry. I also learned she told a teacher at our school about this incident, and CPS was called. Her mother dismissed them, and they left. I am guessing CPS did not push it further due to being people of color. Furthermore, the pressure of all this stuff has been worsening her mental state, and last Monday, she tried to kill herself by causing an allergic reaction. Luckily, she did not die. Repeatedly, I have said to her that she needs to go to therapy because she needs to talk to a professional about this, not her friend. She has said she refuses because a therapist “won’t do shit.” So here I am now, just trying to help her, feeling that I have reached my limit.

I am tired. I am frazzled. I am grieving the loss of my aunt. I am recovering from being kicked out of my friend group for setting my boundaries (not wanting to be bullied and picked on anymore). I have been diagnosed with PTSD (luckily a milder form) from all of this that has happened. Is this something that is unique to Gen-Z? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone has had a similar experience to tell me how they handled this. 

Thank you.

2025-06-02 21:17:41;I’m in EMDR therapy and I accidentally created a Kesha SUD scale.;"Im somewhat new to EMDR. I’ve only had a few sessions. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago. Well, I started to spiral last night. And I noticed that the song “blow” by Kesha that was exactly how I felt like what was happening in my head. So, I built off of it and stuck with Kesha. 8 songs, like the 8 steps of reprocessing a memory. I know it sounds crazy, but it WORKED for me. By the time I finished the 8th song, was at a 0. So, I accidentally created a Kesha playlist SUD scale with my fave Kesha songs. If someone doesn’t know me personal journey..this list makes no sense. 

8. Blow (10 - my brain was in chaos) 

7. Stronger (8/9- this is a Kesha feature really not a Kesha song. It makes me sob) 

6. Good Old Days (hovering around a 7 here. Another Kesha feature. Again, makes me sob.)

5. Die Young ( I got down to a 5 here)

4. YIPPEE KI YAY. (I was easily at a 3 or below here. I love this song.)

3. Take It Off (2 or less.. this just time warps me back to a nightclub 15 years ago dancing without a care in the world)

2. Tik Tok ( 1-0 same as above)

1. Your love is my drug (0. I literally was just vibing by the time this song hit)

2025-05-27 08:25:14;I hate myself so much. I don’t know how to heal.;"
CW: Multiple 

I fucking hate myself so much. Not even all the adjectives associated with hate can even equate to an atom of how much I hate, no, ABHOR, LOATHE, DESPISE, myself.

I hate every aspect of myself. The way I talk, the way I look so fucking hideous and ugly, the fact that I can't regulate my enotions, my skinny ass body, my shit tons of extreme psychological trauma, my smile, my voice, the way I have to pretend so that I can survive, the way that the only way I can feel good about myself is that I sexualise myself, my problems - both mental and physical, the way I can't keep friends, the way that I place people on pedestals only to destroy and then rebuild them, the way that people leave, the way I overthink and catatrophise, the way I can't make friends and avoid them like the plague, the way I self-sabotage and self-harm, the way I ""self-improve"" and every time I try to better myself and how it spirals into obsession and self-harm all the time and then I scorn myself even more for not doing anything with my life and victimising myself. Everything is so exhausting.

And then comes when I feel like I'm the hottest person in the world, the most perfect man to ever walk this fucking planet, which is not fun at all because intellectually, I know that it's not true and it's also temporary.

My mum doesn't help either. She's diagnosed bipolar and schizophrenic, and couldn't look after me and my sister. I sometimes blame myself for her mental conditions because they started a few months / years after I was born. She was mostly negligent towards me and I was the ""golden child"", the sibling that was favourited, whilst my sister was often abused due to the envy that she has for her, leaving my dad to look after us for nearly 2 fucking decades. And now? She's going against her partner's back with the same wife-beater yet again, just as she did with my dad. And the thing that makes it so much worse is his child calls her ""stepmum"". It's so wrong and it's beyond me. But she doesn't fucking listen.

And don't get me even started on how much I hate my sexuality. I can't decide if I'm gay, asexual, demisexual, or something else entirely. And on top of all that, to make matters worse, I feel even more disgusting because I have the incredibly dangerous combo of having a paraphilic disorder (microphilia / macrophilia), which makes me feel worse, as well as internalised homophobia from the amount of trauma caused by my sexuality, the hate crimes, the fucking sexual assault that made me feel so uncomfortable that I can still feel my perpetrator's hands on me even a year on, the fact that I got physically assaulted 5 times, which gets triggered at even the slightest remark or ""joke"" about my sexuality or voice, say someone calls me ""zesty"" or goes ""he takes it up the bum"". It sucks so fucking bad.

Do I want to die? Absolutely fucking yes. I'm not resilient - I'm trapped. Trapped because a small part of myself still hopes for a future, yearns to be loved like I've always wanted, believes that this is the only shot at life that I will ever get, and I dread to think of how it will affect the ones I leave behind. I'm not suicidal, though. It's confusing.

Those people who say to ""love yourself"" can go fucking do one.

Why does life have to be so fucked up and complicated?

But more importantly... Will I ever be able to fix this? Will I ever be able to love myself? Will I ever be able to recover and break from this cycle?

Those are the questions that make me want to carry on. But for now. I don't know what to do moving forward.";r/traumatoolbox;4;6;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1kw9wvw/i_hate_myself_so_much_i_dont_know_how_to_heal/

2025-05-20 02:16:06;Trigger warning: he raped me and when I confronted him he said I owe HIM an apology;"I was 21.I was grieving, heartbroken, raw. A guy I’d liked had just dumped me because I’d told him about my emotionally abusive father. He didn’t want to deal with the trauma.
On top of that, my grandfather had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I was about to fly out of state to spend the summer saying goodbye while watching him die.
I messaged an old friend from high school. I didn’t want to see him. I didn’t want to do anything. I just wanted to talk to someone. That’s it.
But he told me he was already on his way.I said, “No. Please don’t come.”He told me if I didn’t sneak out of the back door of my parents’ house, he would come to the front and knock. Loudly. At 2am. My father was volatile. That would’ve been dangerous for me. So I snuck out.
He met me outside, and immediately the energy felt off. He wanted to park somewhere private. I said I didn’t want to do anything. I said no—more than once. I told him I was grieving. I told him I wasn’t okay.
He didn’t stop. He didn’t back off.When I tried to leave, he said again that he would follow me home and knock on the door. That he wouldn’t let me go inside.
I was trapped.And then he took my virginity.
It wasn’t violent in the traditional way. But it wasn’t consensual.He wore me down until I stopped resisting. He didn’t ask. He didn’t care.I bled for days. I couldn’t even go into the ocean with my dying grandfather because it stung too badly. I couldn’t sit right. I couldn’t walk comfortably. I was in pain in every way.
I didn’t even know how to label what had happened. It didn’t look like the word ""rape"" I’d seen on TV. But I never said yes.I only stopped saying no because he made it unsafe to keep trying.
I carried that night with me in silence for years. It broke me.I never had healthy intimacy again. I never felt safe. I thought something was wrong with me.
In 2023, six years later, I finally told him what he did.
This is what I said to him:
""You took my virginity in a car while I cried.I said no and you told me you’d follow me home and knock on my door.You knew I was in pain and didn’t care.You didn’t stop.You didn’t ask.You didn’t listen.You made it about how I didn’t love you, when the truth is I didn’t even know how to love myself yet.You took something I wasn’t ready to give, because you felt entitled to it.And then you called it love.""
You know what he said back?
He sent a massive message making himself the victim.He said:
* I “shit on his love”
* He “didn’t take anything from me”
* That I “never really cared” about him
* That he had to forgive me
* That I was living in “victim mentality”
* That I should “forgive myself” and “move on”
* That I ruined his ability to love
* And that he’s “healed” now because he finally learned to stop caring about other people’s feelings
He said I never really said no. That I didn’t communicate clearly. That it was just “a miscommunication.” That I misunderstood his love.
This man violated me and now stands on the hill of his own delusion screaming about how I hurt him.
He’s getting married soon. He’s having a baby. He’s “healed.” He sleeps at night. 
(I take what he says as a grain of salt because previously he had told me he is a time God) 
I still carry it in my bones.
Every time I’m intimate with someone, that moment crawls up my spine.Every time someone calls me dramatic, or sensitive, or selfish, I hear his voice saying I ruined everything. That my pain was a burden to him. That I’m the one who made it toxic.
I’m not posting this for pity. I’m posting it because coercion is rape.Manipulation is violence.And too many of us are walking around with trauma we don’t feel ""allowed"" to name because it wasn’t violent enough for courtrooms or trauma centers.
But it was violent to me.And that’s all that matters.

2025-05-11 13:54:11;scared something happened to me when i was a child;"hi! i’m really really sorry if the formatting is off, i’m on mobile right now. 

i (18f) genuinely cannot remember a large, large majority of my childhood. if i can, it’s a few negative events which i’ve come to terms with (in the sense that i realize that they’ve happened and there’s nothing i can do about it). however, i cannot shake the feeling that something extremely traumatic happened to me in my childhood that i cannot remember. 

i don’t want to say anything extreme, but anytime anyone speaks about any type of abuse or sexual assault, i feel disgusting and guilty and extremely anxious. i feel like i can’t talk about this to anybody else, because i don’t want to look like im seeking attention. 

my ap psych teacher has told me/taught my class about how the concept of “repressed memories” are not real, which i think is why i’m confused. 

if this helps, ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder as well as major depression (granted, ive refused to see a psychiatrist since i was about 13, so maybe i need to speak to one again), so im not sure if its just me being paranoid or if theres something deeper??? i dont want to feel like this anymore ):";r/traumatoolbox;5;5;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1kjtzaq/scared_something_happened_to_me_when_i_was_a_child/
2025-05-11 04:22:15;9 years;"
I finally got diagnosed with ptsd 

I still keep thinking about what happened and how affectionate he sounded. Normally in our friendship he was really cold and muted emotionally with everything. I'd never heard him sound so happy, but angry at the same time. 

 I remember him telling me to settle down and shushing me as if he was talking to a frightened animal or something. But it was me. I remember he kept pointing out how much I was shaking and how frightened I looked like it was adorable to him. Sometimes when I tried to move away towards the door he constricted me and sounded a lot more aggressive and said things like ""your heart is racing so fast. I can hear it. Ohh, just feel that."" And he pressed his hand down and I remember realising how much I was panicking  and he sounded like he was going to eat me. Sometime he said ""I shouldn't. I shouldn't"" and ""I can't help myself. I just can't help myself!"", and ""your skin is so soft."" 

He kept trying to convince me I was imagining everything, he tried to convince me he was a ghost, that I was stuck in a dream and the only way out would be to tell him what he was doing to me. I didn't believe him at all, I was just frightened of him. He kept saying, ""Nothings happening. Shhhhhhh. I'm not doing anything"" over and over again anytime I said I don't want to do anything or please let me sleep I want to go to sleep. He kept telling me he was just cuddling me but he was trying to rape me. 

I was freaking out so much I thought if I scream he is going to kill me, if I cry it'll turn him on, if I try fight he will kill me, so I just curled up and tried to keep myself together I hid my face in the pillow.

Later when it got worse he was trying to tell me I don't know who I am, I don't understand myself and that he was trying to help me become normal. He was talking about how at my age 'boys become men and girls become women' and that if I stopped struggling I would feel very good and he would be gentle, that I need him to be gentle don't I? and that I need to embrace my feelings and let it happen. He said 'I'm going to make you a woman' and I was terrified of him.  I just wanted him to be my friend again 

I was running out of energy so i forced myself to look at him. I asked him, ""Why are you doing this to me?"", hoping it would make him see me as a human again, and he smiled very wide like he was speechless and then started laughing at me and he looked so happy but also like he was going to kill me. I don't know how to explain it. 

I don't remember sleeping I just remember waking up and trying to leave the room, he attacked me again but this time he sounded so content. I told him I don't want to do anything, but he ignored me and was just talking to me about if I slept well and how he is giving me more cuddles and saying good morning. I was really struggling and he was just laughing at me, I remember I didn't bother trying not to cry or hiding how angry I was but it didn't stop him he was just mocking me. I finally got out of there because i heard people outside so I elbowed him in his ribs and ran into the bathroom. 

He forced me to walk home with him, and he was holding my wrist and lecturing me about how I need to stand up for myself because he worries someone might take advantage of me and how I can always tell him if I'm uncomfortable and he will listen because we are best friends, and he can't wait to hang out with me again and that I had bad dreams during the night and kept waking up. I thought he was going to drag me into his flat, so I ran away when I had the chance to.  When I got home he messaged me and said ""don't tell anyone we slept together ;) Wouldn't want them asking weird questions"". 

The next time I saw him was at the youth club and he was just staring at me and smiling at me like I was his property or something. I remember I felt so afraid but my mind told me if you don't say something now this will never stop. I blacked out, I don't remember saying anything but I was told that id gone mental at him and told him stop smiling at me there's nothing to smile about and to leave me alone.

Update 4 (FINAL):
It's been nine years since the original event and I wanted to give an update for those who cared enough to give advice, guidance, and support.

I [now 42] am raising my now son [FtM 15] and he is loving life. He's involved in his school marching band and is such a creative artistic force. He goes to therapy once a week still. He hasn't really felt ready to dive into the abuse issues, but he acknowledges that the abuse is most likely why he considers himself asexual. 

The therapist assured his mother that his gender identity has nothing to do with the abuse and says there are studies that have shown there is no correlation between the molestation and his gender identity. He wants to see an endocrinologist soon to ask about wrapping/binding, as that's the only thing we're comfortable with at his age. He still asks that I use she/her around his grandparents as well as his birth name around them. That's been difficult to mentally switch between but I'm doing my best. 

As for myself...I'm doing okay. It's been a roller coaster. After my last engagement ended, I wound up breaking routine and dated someone that wasn't my type but seemed fun [f29] for about a year and a half. She ended up being abusive and absolutely crazy (most likely Bipolar or Histrionic). I ended things after she started hitting me. 

About six months after that (2018), I met an amazing person [f24] and we dated and eventually married in 2020. We were together for six wonderful years. But as she approached her thirties, she decided she didn't really want to be married anymore and missed the freedom of single life. It came out of nowhere and utterly destroyed me. Unfortunately, I turned to alcohol and cocaine to numb the pain and that got pretty bad, and I became suicidal, but thanks to some amazing friends, I was able to lean on them and get through that really dark period. 

Also in the last year, I was able to get diagnosed with SEVERE ADHD and I'm told most likely Autism as well. That helped explain so much why I struggled to know what to do when everything went down. Interpreting social norms and cues poorly, I believe, was a big factor in my confusion as to how to handle everything initially. 

Anyways, I've now been single for over a year...the first time in my life really. I've been in therapy, and exercising. I feel like a new person. Someone that doesn't need a relationship to be happy. If I ever make the decision to get into another relationship, it will be with someone that truly understands and loves me...not because I'm scared of being alone.

As for the abuser, I haven't seen or heard anything about him since then. He and I worked in the same building (giant 8 story office building) and for the six months I continued to work there, I parked and entered through the service entrance to avoid bumping into him. I would literally run down the hall to my office, shut the door behind me, sit on the floor and hyperventilate for five minutes. Every morning for six months. I used to carry a gun for personal protection, but I decided to stop, in fear that if I bumped into him, I'd use it. Years of therapy has helped me compartmentalize it. I hope I never see him again...and I hope he lives the rest of his days in fear of crossing me.

And my son loves me more than anything. His mother (my ex) even told me, ""They worship you."" He trusts me unconditionally, and even though he's going through the usual teen hormone madness, he still wants me to come up and tell him goodnight when he goes to bed. I try to tell myself it's enough, but I still feel I should have protected him better. 

This will most likely be my last update.

To those who gave me comfort throughout my journey and said that my child will always remember that I stood up for her when no one else would...well he does remember. I will always be there for him.";r/rapecounseling;10;1;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1kip7ur/update_4_me_33m_with_my_daughter_6f_and_im/
2025-05-06 00:26:27;I think I was raped yet I feel like a cheater. I can't make sense of what happened.;"For background, I (31M) was recently diagnosed with autism and this is important to understand the mental state at which I was in when this happened. I had unknowingly been struggling with severe autistic burnout\*\* for a couple of years which caused me to breakup with my fiancé and call off our wedding despite not wanting to. I was struggling with panic disorder (which I now know was really meltdowns related to my autistic burnout and recent diagnosis) and felt like I was losing my mind and myself. Despite my fiancé never making me feel like a burden and me wanting to spend my life with her, I just snapped. I couldn't take the mental struggles anymore and I didn't understand what was going on with me. In the month that followed our breakup, we didn’t see each other at all. We had some emotional conversations expressing confusion and that we still wanted to be together, but never officially got back together.

My boss had been pressuring me to go on a business trip all year. I kept putting it off due to my health, but it came up again and I caved. There was a woman who worked out of the office I was traveling to. She was in my office earlier in the year and was very forward with me. I told her I was engaged and she seemed to back off. Now that I was in her office, she asked if I wanted to get lunch. Here was my first mistake. I accepted thinking it was just professional. During lunch, my second mistake was her asking about my fiancé to which I told her we were taking a break. My next mistake was agreeing to go out for dinner and drinks with a group of people that included her. I wasn’t blacked out by any means but I had about 5 drinks. Everyone knew that this girl liked me and very childishly was pressuring me to kiss her while we were out. I gave her a kiss on the cheek to appease everyone. I know that was stupid and I don't know why I still hung around these people after that. While we were walking back from dinner, we were close to my hotel and the group wanted to hang out in my room, so of course I said “yes”. In hindsight, I can see how each of these decisions sent the wrong message and can now see the manipulation, but in the moment, I really didn’t see it that way. Things turned very badly quickly. Not long after being in the hotel room did everyone decide to leave, but she remained. She immediately became very forward touching me. She climbed on top of me and was dry humping me. I laid there thinking if I didn’t participate she would stop. She didn’t. She pulled out a condom and I don’t know why, but I allowed it to happen. I didn’t want to, but I participated. I pretended to finish just so that it would stop.

I hated myself. How could I let this happen? Why didn’t I say no or stop it? I was not attracted to this person, I was not looking for sex, I cannot think of any logical reason why I would let this happen. I'm a man, I could have easily stopped her. It's not like she drugged me or physically restrained me. I was weak. Not weak in the sense of someone who couldn’t resist sex, weak in the sense where I couldn’t stand up for myself. My partner was at home waiting for me and I was allowing someone to have sex with me. A cheater. I never thought I was capable of doing something so awful like cheating. Cheating has always been a mortal sin to me and something I very consciously made a point to never do. I can't make sense of this.

\*\* For those who don't know what autistic burnout is, here is Google overview definition: ""Autistic burnout is a state of profound fatigue, loss of function, and increased sensory sensitivity experienced by autistic individuals due to prolonged stress, often stemming from masking or living in environments that don't accommodate their needs. It's characterized by a depletion of internal resources, both mentally and physically, and can manifest in various ways, including difficulty with executive functioning, social interactions, and increased sensitivity to sensory input."" When something like this is left untreated, mistreated, or not taken seriously, autistics can get stuck in burnout for months to years. Some claim that even when recovered, they are never really the same anymore since skill regression is common.";r/rapecounseling;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1kffwsw/i_think_i_was_raped_yet_i_feel_like_a_cheater_i/
2025-05-05 02:50:29;I was raped a year ago and it‘s still messing me up;I 23F was with my boyfriend at the time. He was my first. We didn‘t last long, this happened like 3 months into the relationship. We were having sex, so far everything was consensual. Then he asked me if we can do anal, to which I said no. I don‘t know what his obsession with anal was, but he asked me before if we can do it. I always said no at first, but he kept asking and asking until I eventually gave in. But this time that wasn‘t the case. I said no and never switched to a yes. He was over me at that point, I was basically trapped. He suddenly opened the lubricant bottle next to us and quickly applied it on my butthole. I was overwhelmed with the situation and how fast everything was happening, I said „what are you doing? I said no“ and a second later he was inside my butthole. I didn’t know what to do. He was so much stronger compared to me (he’s in the military) I was scared that things would escalate if I tried to fight him. I was also scared that he would get more violent if I resisted, and would cause permanent damage down there. I didn‘t know what to do so I basically just laid there like a corpse, not moving, waiting for it to be over. I think it only lasted for a couple minutes, but those were the longest minutes of my life. It was the most dehumanizing experience I ever had. It still messes with me a year later, I even got diagnosed with PTSD from it.

2025-04-27 22:23:40;Could these experiences lead to trauma or paraphilia?;"I’ve (M) been told that I have unresolved trauma, yet I don't feel traumatized. My childhood wasn’t perfect, but I also have many good memories.  Still, I'll try to share some of the negative experiences I remember.  

I was raised by my mother and grandparents, so I never knew my biological father. My mother didn't wanna talk about him, and like my grandmother, she struggled with severe depression and had a bit of a controlling side.  
They used to argue a lot when I was a kid, and I often worried that my mother might leave me or kill herself.  
There were nights when I'd peek through her bedroom door just to check if she was still alive.  

My mom eventually introduced me to her partner (now husband), but I never truly connected with him or called him ""dad.""  
I always felt annoyed and embarrassed by him and didn't want anyone to assume he was my father.  

I was prone to anxiety, and from a young age, turned to masturbation as a way to relieve stress.  
At the age of 9-10 I acted sexually inappropriately with some of my peers, including a younger one who ended up crying. I can't explain it, but I was almost obsessed with sex.  
As I grew older, my sexual arousal started to mix with violence. I have sexual sadism, and I masturbate to gore videos and fantasies of torture and murder, where I imagine myself having complete control over someone.  
I first noticed this when I was around 14-15.  

I did well in school, but being an introvert made me an easy target for bullying, especially in middle school, so I mostly kept to myself.  
I remember feeling unwanted, wondering if I was adopted, what my father may be like and digging through my mother's stuff for old letters and photos hoping to find clues, but I never told anyone.  
From 2nd to 5th grade, I also had a teacher who used humiliation and fear as punishment. Looking back, I realize that many of her actions would likely get her in serious trouble today.  

In high school things were going pretty smooth for a while, but then I began getting into trouble and ditching classes. This caused my grades to drop and more fights at home, some of which got physical.  
I was also dealing with this pressure to be better than everyone else, and not being able to live up to that only increased my frustration.  I had no direction or motivation, I felt like I was stuck in place while everyone else was moving forward.  

Due to my problematic behavior in my teens, I was prescribed Paxil for 5 years, which made me feel even more empty than before. I was also abusing it while drinking.  
As an adult, I was diagnosed with ASPD. I don't take any meds and don’t intend to.  I went through CBT but it felt like a waste of time.  
I have anger issues, extreme mood swings, tend to be controlling (according to my ex) and I'm a high-functioning alcoholic (I'm trying to quit).  
I also used to be addicted to benzos and codeine and would go to work high almost daily.  
I get bored very quickly, so I'm constantly jumping from one shit to another, without ever feeling fully satisfied. The same goes for my relationships.  

My mother has been talking about my father a lot recently, which really pisses me off but I'm not sure why.  
I care about her, she did her best, but our relationship has always been complicated.  
However, after doing some research I discovered how my father died, though the details are still unclear.  
And I probably have half siblings out there but I honestly don't give a fuck";r/traumatoolbox;2;6;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1k9547c/could_these_experiences_lead_to_trauma_or/
2025-04-26 07:23:33;How To Get Over Rape? TW: Suicidal Thoughts;"This might be a long one but here goes

I was groomed from about the age of 10 and was raped at 16. Never thought it was an issue that had so much power over me until a couple months ago. I suffer from depression however I am not diagnosed (I just refuse to have it documented & for it cause more problems later in life). I thought it was normal about the emotions I felt. From mood swings to suicidal ideation. 

It wasn’t til a couple months where I was talking to a therapist after a mental breakdown I had and I just mentioned in a casual conversation that I was raped. Ofc it shocked her cause we never discussed shit about it & in that moment I kinda felt & understood that it wasn’t normal. The other problem to it as it made me so numb & emotion less. I disliked being touched & it has been hard for me to feel certain emotions but I do truly try to sympathize with ppl when in need… everyone knows I’m not the best at that. Might also be the reason I seem like an ass online.

Regardless what’s also been tugging at me about this is religion. I was never the most in tune with religion but after what happened to me I just somewhat felt the need to also blame God (which might seem wrong but I can’t help it). I feel hurt to know I was never protected & have never been protected with him. Ppl talk about free will but I just feel so much bad has happened to me & the worst part of it is that when I do interact with me they start to become more religious.

To sum up the timeline. I was groomed until 16. Then raped at 16 (how I lost my virginity). Then I met this dude & we had talked for 4 Years but never a relationship just casual sex. Once we stopped having sex just about 1-2 months ago he got baptized & became celibate (he was somewhat religious but never full on) & he ended up getting a girlfriend soon we stopped having sex which broke me. Cool I tried to move on & found another dude. Found out he was also semi religious. We mingle & get sexual and then after a few more encounters he tells me he’s focusing on religion.

Now it’s present time & I just feel like somehow I’m the Devil. The odds of me being groomed, raped, strung along etc & has never had a boyfriend just breaks me. 

I just want to be at peace about what happened to me. However I’m not sure how to heal. I never told anyone in my family & the only ppl who know about it was the sexual partners I had. I just feel worthless & numb. I have been trying to get back into therapy but my I have to reach the deductible before my insurance will pay.

2025-04-24 03:04:55;Why dont i feel loved without being sexualised?;I was raped when i was 10 years old by a family member im now 15 and struggle with anxiety and Disordered eating (Not an eating disorder but similar to one) and currently being diagnosed with autisim. I am in a healthy relationship of 1 year with my boyfriend who knows my story and my messed up past/childhood. I live alone with my mum (who herself struggles with anxiety and is diagnosed with BPD) my dad is an alcoholic and suffers with drug abuse so hes not much help. after my rape i seeked help in older boys and my male dominated friend group as i was the only girl i was sexualised oftenly and SA’d by all of them multiple times even if i said no or stop (i have separated myself from these people) i struggled alot but i felt liked and i was getting attention but in a way i didnt want but i felt like if i wasnt sexualised, i wasnt liked by others. My new partner had dragged me away from that group of people not knowing he had saved me, when i told him all of the things that had happened quite recently into our relationship he was furious, he doesn’t let my old friend group contact me and hes made it clear that i cant be around people who do that to me and he said ‘i would never do any of that to you.’ which at first felt like a soft breeze i felt noticed until a few weeks in. He didnt touch me he didnt try to kiss me instantly, My anxiety levels had been high i thought does he really think im disgusting? why wont he do something? which now i feel guilty about for even thinking about. Obviously we have a sexual relationship but he always says ‘We dont have to do this if your uncomfortable’ or ‘Just tell me to stop if it gets to much’ But him saying im uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable i feel like im not desired by him. I know this is alot to read and might not make much sense so ill try shorten it or try to at least. I dont feel loved unless im sexualised. And i know its probably horrible of me to say and in my head i know the little girl in me is terrified but something has changed in me that makes me feel like im not loveable unless im being touched or at least looked at in a lustful way. Does anyone have any advice that can make this stop? or atleast anyone who relates?;r/rapecounseling;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1k67g0x/why_dont_i_feel_loved_without_being_sexualised/

It was my third time having sex with him, we had discussed previously our turn ons and our offs. He was very into choking and I flat out said I am not into that and to never do that to me.

I initiated the sex and consented everything was going okay until he wrapped his hands around my throat choking me and then began to basically jack hammer into me. I panicked and felt like I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t say stop or no but I dug my nails into his arms and tried to pull them away but I couldn’t. He finished threw the condom away and left. Since then I dissociate often, have nightmares about him, and sometimes I swear I see him everywhere I go even though I now live in a different state. I’ve been diagnosed with c-PTSD due to other truamatic events in my life including CSA. I just can’t tell if he raped me or if it was sexual assault since I initiated, consented, and didnt say no or stop.";r/rapecounseling;5;8;https://reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/1k15bbg/was_it_rape_or_sexual_assault/

Also, SA trigger warning later in writing after stated.

Main Question: do any of you guys know anything about the possible existence of someone developing tics after traumatic experience(s) and or anything that could help it?

I have never been diagnosed or talked to anyone but one person about possible trauma but I'm very confident it's trauma unless I try to invalidate myself. I match almost every single symptom of PTSD to extremity where it causes significant issues in my day to day life. I have had tics for at least 4 years but it was always very unoften. After experiencing something potentially traumatic, I started experiencing significantly more tics. The trauma started in last mid october but i only know that tics was a huge problem by January.  I have a hard time making a mental timeline of my symptoms with this.

I know i do take marijuana to help deal with trauma often (not unoften several times day) but i never experienced tics because of marijuana to my knowledge in the past before like some people do. I have had periods of time where I took marijuana a lot like I do at this point but didn't have these such heavy symptoms. (I have dealt and continue to deal with chronic depression and anxiety but those symptoms were never quite like the ones I speak of when I read the DSM-5 TR PTSD criteria and literature.)

My tics consist of random gasps for air, sudden jolts through my body like my shoulder makes a huge shrug or sometimes my whole upper body jolting. It varies and extremity and i notice that i compulsively tell myself to stop often when it happens. It often comes whenever i remember certain things or experience anxiety. Sometimes, I'll feel normal and all of a sudden it comes and sometimes l'm able to stop it, sometimes I fail for a long. It has gotten to the point where it's not so unoften for me to have rapid tics on repeat for long periods of time often while having panic attacks at the same time but it’s gotten better recently. It goes through waves like my mental health in general. I do find that closing my eyes and focusing on my breathing and general meditative practices help my anxiety and tics incredibly but it can often take a bit of time for it to subside substantially.

I'll add that I started taking Vyvanse not so long before (less than a month) the potentially traumatic events occurred and I've heard that people have developed tics from it but I only ever noticed some time following the events that I speak of.

Does anyone have any resources or anecdotal experience to help me understand all of this and maybe help me stop it?

I read a case study about a young girl who dealt with something similar in a court case with her abusive father (something along the lines of that) but that's all l've seen so far.

2025-04-02 18:27:44;Therapist leaving... again;"Therapist leaving... again

Tldr; I found out that I'm losing my new therapist, shortly after losing my long term therapist just a few months ago, and a long history of abrupt loss of care and compounded abandonment trauma, and I'm on the verge of crashing out. 

I've made a few posts already on this subject in this and another therapy sub, which are still up (can't link in this sub but i don't post often so they should be easy to find on my page), if you want my original thoughts on this. But the gist of the issue is this:

I lost my long term therapist in January. I had been seeing him for over 2 years. He was the only therapist I've ever truly connected with. I have a really hard time being comfortable opening up with people, it took a long time for us to get there. We delved into trauma processing therapy, including EMDR and narrative processing (formally diagnosed with PTSD). We still had a lot to work through, as I have extensive trauma related to abuse, sexual abuse, neglect and abandonment and it took a long time before I was capable of talking about these issues with him. There's still quite a bit that I hadn't even been able to tell him at all yet.

His leaving was not by choice, he was blindsided by the clinic in December about not renewing his contract in the new year. Which meant he was not able to give me much notice, we only had 3 sessions after finding this out. (he had previously assured me he had no intention of ending my care anytime soon and that if it became necessary the process would be handled delicately and would spend several seasons preparing me for it and making sure I found care with someone else first). This was extremely emotional for me, I became very disregulated and emotionally shut down.

I have a history of abandonment and neglect in my childhood, and I've experienced the sudden loss of care providers several times already. This was the third time I've had care from a therapist abruptly end in a way that made me feel extremely vulnerable and like I had no control over what happens to me. Every therapy relationship I've ever had has ended like this. I also had similar abrumpt endings with three different primary care doctors. I've experienced multiple times trying to find mental health care but found that clinics either never answered their phone, wouldn't call back, or were all full. I spent years feeling like I was falling through the cracks in the system before I finally got in to this one. 

Before he left, my therapist connected me with another colleague at the clinic who had been there for years, who he felt would be a good fit for me. He recognized that this was a major trauma trigger for me and that the experience was very damaging.

I started seeing this new therapist in January. This was going okay, but I was obviously still very fragile. I liked her, but I struggled a lot feeling comfortable opening up with her. This is something I talked about with my previous therapist a lot in our last sessions, feeling like I was not going to be able to trust a new therapist again enough to open up, because I would be too afraid of the emotional fall out I would experience when they eventually left. 

The therapy wasn't unbenificial, but we were still mostly focusing on shallow issues, with me also filling her in about my family history and some of the trauma that is a bit easier to talk about. No real trauma processing yet. Then in February she had to cancel an appointment last minute, and told me she would contact me when she was able to return to work to reschedule. I was mostly okay with this but it did make me a little nervous.

After that I didn't hear back from her at all for 3 more weeks. This was a major trigger for me, I had an intense depressive episode, especialy as i had not been told how long this was going to be. At one point I found out she had already come back (I don't know when) but she hadnt contacted me yet. I know logically this wasn't likely on purpose, but it was still triggering and made me feel more cautious about trusting her. I had a major fear that I was falling through the cracks in the system again. I made a post about it on here, but I finally heard back from her a few days after making it.

 I started seeing her again in March. I was still struggling against a need to emotionally protect myself. I was able to open up a little, but it's been hard. The three week absence put me on edge. I had knew a small amount about the reason (family emergency) and I had a feeling that it was going to come back up.Today I found out she is leaving the clinic due to a family emergency, and that she won't be coming back. 

She said it was entirely unexpected and that she would have never committed to my care if she knew that this was going to happen (she was aware of my trauma around abandonment and loss of care going in). I understand that it wasn't intentional, but it never is. That's honestly worse. It reinforces the strong feeling I can't shake that no matter how good or responsible a therapist is, they're still going to be forced to abandon my care. I can't judge how safe I am with them by how stable pr professional they are.

I am honestly so exhausted. I feel so fragile, and it gets worse every time this happens. As soon as she told me, I felt all my walls i had worked on the past few months go right back up. I mentally checked out of the conversation and basically emotionally shut her out and went through the motions for the rest of the conversation until it ended. At this point I don't know how the hell I'm ever supposed to convince myself again that I can be emotionally safe with another therapist.

We have one more session later this week. I don't know when she's leaving, or if she is planning on offering another appointment to me again before she does, or if I would even take it. I agreed to at least meet her for our scheduled appointment, but I'm not really sure what will come from that, I think I'm essentially totally emotionally closed off right now.

She said she is going to set me up with another therapist in the clinic who she thinks would be a good fit. She said she thinks the only reason my last therapist didn't set me up with her before was because her schedule was full. Apparently it still is, but given my situation they want to prioritize getting me care as soon as possible. I don't know yet how soon this can happen or how often she can see me. I'm also skeptical of the quality of care I'll receive from a therapist who is clearly overworked, and concerned that she will also leave (especially if she's already overburdened and possibly burnt out).

I'm honestly so burnt out I don't even know if I want to see this other therapist. I honestly just don't believe it will last anymore. It took me a long time to get to a place where I could trust my last therapist, and this ability was pretty much shattered when he left. I considered quitting therapy all together. I have been trying to maintain a positive outlook with the new one, only for it to happen again. She said that therapist has been at the clinic for a decade, but my last therapist had been there for over 7 years, so what difference does that make? How am I supposed to view any therapist as a safe, stable place to heal knowing that at any moment they can and are likely to abruptly leave??

It's been suggested that I look into private practice, as the therapists there are more stable, but I can't afford that. The clinic I go to specializes in low income care. I'm on Medicade, and sliding scale, plus I qualify for low income grants through the clinic. This means I'm often only paying for very low copays (depending on grant availability) with a very flexible pay schedule. It's frankly not something I think I will find with private practice, and I can barely afford my car and food as it is now. 

I've considered quitting therapy. I know I shouldn't, because I am not in a good place now and I really do need help. I made a lot of progress with my last therapist, but there is still a lot of chaos and lack of control and trauma to process. But k can't take this constant instability and loss of control. I don't know how to move forward from this. ";r/traumatoolbox;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1jplayy/therapist_leaving_again/

I do have a psychiatrist & therapist, but they suck and talk to me like a child. I’m 26. 

My biggest struggle right now is not having a support system, or even just one person I could turn to. I wish I had a friend or a family member. I had a really horrible day yesterday and used chat gbt to get some advice. 

I want to utilize the resources I have to build a sense of support. I’m trying to find a new therapist & psychiatrist. I have low income insurance. My school also offers some social things that I’m interested in like art club, exercise classes.

I just feel so fucked up in the head, I’ve always felt like I don’t belong anywhere. I also feel like nobody loves me. I just need a goddamn hug, someone to tell me everything is okay, but I don’t know if I can get that. Like I wish I could find a support group or something.

2025-01-26 15:25:01;Navigating Boundaries and Healing While Living with Family;"\[Trigger Warning\] Discussion of boundary violations, emotional triggers, and family dynamics.

Hi y'all! Self-healer here who actively goes to therapy and is always looking to grow. My intention in writing this is to connect with others meaningfully and positively. I wanted a place where I could reflect while staying anonymous but also be as open and honest about my experience. Just a heads-up—this might be a long post, as it chronicles my feelings and experiences over the past year.

I am an introvert and very private about my life. I have been diagnosed with panic attacks, anxiety, depression, and CPTSD. I am also neurodivergent. Over the last year, I have had to adjust quickly to significant life changes, which has been really difficult for me emotionally and mentally as a neurodivergent person. I was laid off from my job, broke my apartment lease due to mold, moved into an Airbnb temporarily, and then relocated across the country to stay with a relative.

My relative (we'll call her Kelly) offered to let me stay rent-free while I worked on becoming financially stable and finding a job. Making major life decisions is something I never do on a whim. As someone on the spectrum, it takes a lot of energy and time for me to think through every possible avenue. This process is essential to my autonomy and confidence.

It was hard emotionally to decide to move. My closest friends (we'll call them Harry and Sally) from back home helped convince me that it would be a good choice in the long run to help me financially, reminding me that it was only temporary. I cried and thought about it for weeks. Home was where I felt safe. Harry and Sally were my strongest connections, and we saw each other almost weekly. Every time I was around them, I felt grounded and safe.

Over the years, I had done a lot of inner healing work, focusing on my inner child, self-awareness, boundaries, communication, and authenticity. Leaving home was scary because I feared regressing in the progress I had made, and the uncertainty of when I could return weighed heavily on me. Nine months have passed, and my feelings haven't changed much.

I talk to Harry and Sally almost every week, updating each other about our lives. Since I left, I've visited them every couple of months, and we mail each other photos of our shared memories. I have struggled with a personal fear of being forgotten, something I've always been honest and open about in therapy and in my relationships.

During one of my therapy sessions, I shared how much I appreciated Sally and how grateful I was to have a friend who consistently checks in on me despite the distance. I cried, expressing my deepest fear of waking up one day without Sally in my life. I later texted Sally about what I told my therapist in an effort to be vulnerable, and she responded with kindness and reassurance, as she always does.

Since moving in with Kelly, I have tried engaging with the local community by attending pickleball open courts, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did back home. The people and atmosphere felt different. The desert environment has also made it difficult to enjoy my favorite hobbies, such as paddleboarding, kayaking, camping, and nature walks.

Career-wise, the transition has been challenging. It took me a few months to figure out that I wanted a career that aligned with my values and offered job security. I eventually pursued a certification in Electronic Health Records, knowing that healthcare aligns with my core values. Talking with my close friends, who work in healthcare and education, helped me feel more confident in my decision.

Since being away from home, my motivation to return has been a driving force, helping me manage my depression. I've also been going to the gym daily since the start of the year, finding that physical exercise helps alleviate my depression, even if temporarily.

Now that I've caught up to the present, I want to talk about Kelly. I've known her since I was born and have always loved her. She has good intentions and genuinely wants to help others, especially me. In the beginning, things were great. We laughed and watched Netflix together, and it felt like a ""honeymoon stage."" But over time, we both fell into our routines. I found myself having to repeatedly set and reinforce boundaries.

Initially, I realized that Kelly struggled with vulnerability and boundaries. I chalked it up to senior moments since Kelly is in her mid-70s, making it difficult to connect with her on a deeper level. I had panic attacks for months from adjusting to my new environment and the withdrawal from home. When I sought support from Kelly, she invalidated my experience by saying I was entitled to some, but not all, of my panic attacks. This response made it harder to be open about my feelings, and I became more intentional about sharing my emotions. It reactivated my old coping skills from when I was a kid—feeling invalidated.

I made efforts to connect with her by inviting her to join me in my hobbies like pickleball, walks, and pottery painting, but she always declined. Eventually, I respected her choices and stopped asking. While I enjoy my own company, the hunger for more meaningful connections and shared experiences worsened over time, making my depression harder to manage.

Over time, things started to feel more challenging. Kelly's codependency, insecurities, lack of respect and understanding of boundaries, low emotional intelligence, and controlling tendencies began to surface. She would criticize aspects of my personality, my need for alone time, and even my appearance. Simple tasks, like grocery shopping, could escalate into emotional outbursts from her. Living with these unpredictable reactions triggered my panic attacks, adding to my emotional fatigue.

To meet my need for solitude and reflection, I booked an Airbnb for a couple of days to recharge. I gave myself the space I needed to meditate, journal, and enjoy some time paddleboarding. This decision triggered Kelly, who made me feel guilty for spending money on myself, stating that I should be saving it. I reminded myself that her reaction was a reflection of her own financial concerns rather than a reflection of my choices.

She made a comment at one point, saying there was something wrong with me and that I needed help. This was during a deep depression when I needed a lot of personal alone time. I wasn’t comfortable expressing my true experience or feelings because she wasn’t comfortable with vulnerability, making it really hard to show myself compassion while feeling chronically alone.

Through therapy, I've realized that Kelly's behaviors stem from her unresolved trauma and people-pleasing tendencies. As a recovering people-pleaser myself, being around such behavior has been particularly challenging. It has resurfaced painful memories from my childhood and made me question whether I was regressing. However, my therapist reassured me that I was doing the best I could.

My coping strategy has been to mindfully separate Kelly's reactions from my own choices and needs. I spend most of my time alone and keep our interactions minimal. It wasn't what I initially wanted, but it's necessary to protect my peace and well-being.

If you've read this far, thank you. I hope sharing my journey resonates with someone out there. I'm always looking to learn and grow from others who might have experienced something similar. How have you managed to maintain your boundaries while living with family?

2025-01-21 06:15:39;I was abused as a child and now im venting;"Before I start let me give you some background.
My mom is an Alcoholic with anger management issues, and is diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety and my father is out of the picture. Let’s set the scene to when I was 14 , my mom’s anger was on a steady incline and she recently had been beaten to a pulp by my brothers father just to then have to take in her drug addicted mother. So I do give my mom that, she had a lot on her plate but my mom used to call me her punching bag. When she came home from a night of drinking she’s all happy until she realized her current position in life .. then the anger and abuse sets in.. she grabbed her belt and tore my little body up. This happened on multiple occasions along with her punching me and pinning me up against the wall. Since this Happened a few times I caught on and recorded it happening a few times so I could get her to believe me the morning after and yet she still didn’t .. I wanted to give up but seeing my mom sober and crying about her life and that she needed me.. it me stopped me from doing anything dumb like runaway or s.h
I sometimes wonder what life would’ve been like if I had 😕 but yea that my rant😝";r/traumatoolbox;7;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1i62rvv/i_was_abused_as_a_child_and_now_im_venting/
2025-01-13 03:53:17;My mom makes my trauma about her. What should I do?;"I(15 F) love my mom(45 F), but everytime I accidently mention anything shes done to me she cries. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD(me and my therapist are looking into c-ptsd as I fit those symptoms more), but she refuses to aknowledge it. She was drunk for most of my childhood, and while she is sober now, I don’t really feel all that better. The other day I noticed it was snowing and it reminded me of an incident when I was little. I started to cry and my mom proceeded to ask what was wrong. I told her after a second of debate in my head and then she started yelling at me and crying. She said it seemed like I was lying for attention. My dad just watched and then left, which hurt really bad. 
I feel like i’m never going to be able to process my trauma because everytime it comes up she makes it about her. “You know I feel guilty, what more do you want from me??” “I need a break. I can’t talk to you.” “Its almost like you want me to cry.” are all things shes said to me. Everytime I act like a person with PTSD(which I am), she gets mad/sad at me. I always end up comforting her whenever shes sad, including when shes upset about what shes done to me. I tell her that I forgive her, because I do, and then she seems better and doesnt bring it back up. I feel like her mom. I don’t even know if my dad knows I have ptsd, thats how much its been brushed off.
I really just need some advice or any words from anyone in a similar situation. I feel like I’m going insane.";r/traumatoolbox;21;18;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1hzv98a/my_mom_makes_my_trauma_about_her_what_should_i_do/
2025-01-01 05:46:53;Flashbacks but no PTSD?;Hey, I was wondering if you could experience flashbacks to a traumatic event but if not being from PTSD? When I have my flashbacks I dissociate and ruminate over the things that happened, I get sweaty, and my heart rate rises. They can last awhileee. But my therapist didn’t mention PTSD. We just did one EMDR session to process. I’m afraid to ask for more EMDR. I haven’t bought how I feel during my flashbacks tho, maybe that’ll be when she’ll wanna start really working with me? I just say “hey I’ve been having flashbacks, and it’s causing a lot of anxiety”. I do have anxiety and possible adhd (get officially diagnosed in April). But can flashbacks be from my anxiety and adhd?;r/traumatoolbox;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1hqotnc/flashbacks_but_no_ptsd/
2024-11-29 01:30:50;I struggled in silence for years.;"My reasons were no different from the reasons most people have for staying silent. I was ashamed and maybe even afraid of being judged.

After leaving active duty, I threw myself into the gym sometimes spending hours there each day. I ran every race I could find and even a few marathons. Staying busy kept my trauma at bay, at least until late at night. That’s when the memories hit, and sleep was a battle I was lucky to get an hour or two at best.

Then, in 2020, I was diagnosed with cancer for the first time. The one thing that kept my bad thoughts away working out was taken from me. Fucking cancer. Over the next two years, I faced two more types of cancer, each with its own surgeries and invasive treatments.

I was devastated. Between the complications and my PTSD, it felt like I was in a constant free fall. My energy level was non-existent, and I couldn’t do anything to distract myself.

But then I realized I had a truck. I started driving to the mountains and sleeping in it. I couldn’t hunt, hike, or do any of the things I used to love, but I could at least drive and breathe the fresh air.

For the past three years, truck camping or overlanding, as they call it has been my lifeline. It saved me.

I’m sharing this to tell you: giving up is not an option. No matter what your trauma is, there is always a way forward. If you ever feel alone or hopeless, get in your car and drive. Count sunrises and sunsets. Sleep under the stars. Play with your dog, if you have one.

If I can keep going, so can you. Get better, my friend you deserve it.

2024-11-16 06:07:37;I got mugged in broad daylight and it triggered my PTSD;"I've been trying to internalize this for 3 days but it only feels like I'm heading to a downward spiral. I don't have it in me to talk about this to anyone but I have to speak to someone. This is why I've decided to post this on reddit. Sorry if I sound all over the place

I got mugged 3 days ago in broad daylight. I was just going home back from school and I took the road I usually take. However two guys kept following me and I tried to get away one of them asks me for money and I politely said I didn't have change on me (all I had was a $20 bill). I can't really get into more details yet because this just happened recently but this involved physical as well as verbal violence but I tried to hold my own as much as I could. I don't know how I didn't faint on the spot to be honest. In the end they got away with my $20 bill, they tried to get my backpack away from me but I held on to it as much as I could. In the end they run away and left me alone 

I'm still struggling to deal with this and accept that this happened. For context, I was already diagnosed with severe depression as well as PTSD just as recently as two months ago (I have been going through something difficult over the past 2 years), and I'm not doing exactly well recently. I've been told I need to go outside more, take long walks to help cope with my situation. I just don't know what to do now. I've definitely not gone outside these last 3 days. I also have a lot of family problems atm so I avoided telling them this. But again, I have no one to turn or talk to. And even if I did, I just feel embarrassed of myself for letting them take advantage of me. This is my first time putting this out there and I just want to get over it. I can hardly eat at all. I tried reading about similar situations online hoping it would calm me down and get me to think more rationally. I just don't know what to do. And the fact that it happened in broad daylight only makes matters worse to me: if I'm not safe then then how the hell am I supposed to get out of the house and pretend everything is fine? I also haven't slept well since then and I'm worried it would get worse over time and I don't want to wait until it's too late, so please if someone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.

2024-10-31 23:37:07;New therapist fired me just 12 minutes into the first session. ;"Session with new therapist lasted just 12 minutes before she fired me

I have PTSD. This was the first session and the therapist claims to be trauma informed and to have 11 years experience with CPTSD.

She asked me if I’ve had therapy before, and when I said I have her whole demeanour changed. 

I said the previous therapy had helped and  that the psychiatrist who diagnosed me with CPTSD recommended longer term therapy for me. This set her off. She said if I really “only” had CPTSD I’d be symptom free by now as I’ve already had a few therapy sessions in the past. She kept saying “are you sure there’s not an additional diagnosis that they’ve missed? CPTSD is very easy to cure and if that’s all you had, the trauma would be desensitised and you’d be cured by now.”

When I told her that I found her comments a little concerning. She immediately fired me. 12 minutes into the session.

This individual claims to be a trauma-informed PTSD specialist and she claims 11 years professional experience.

We are in England, so there’s no licensing here. I got her info from a charity for childhood sexual abuse survivors. However, I’ve been unable to find any online presence for her at all — no website, no LinkedIn, no Facebook.  I suppose she could be using a different name or something. 

Her conduct has seriously put me off therapy now.

2024-10-07 07:11:02;Need Advice for Overcoming Anxiety and Life Skill Issues;"Hey everyone,

I hope it’s okay to share my story here. I’m really struggling and could use some support and advice. I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I’ve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn’t socialize much, and because of my mother’s controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.

Since moving to the UK, I’ve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I’ll end up taking a completely different path. It’s incredibly frustrating because I don’t always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.

I got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn’t mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we’re building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can’t take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?

I feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I’ve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don’t help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife. It’s tough to see how this impacts her, and I want to do better for both of us.

I also have significant anxiety when it comes to talking to new people. I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there’s a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions. I bite my nails and the skin around my fingers constantly, which is another sign of my anxiety. I’ve even taken therapy sessions in the past for psychosexual issues, including struggles with fantasy, porn addiction, and masturbation.

Now that I’m in the UK and no longer under my mother’s control, I’m trying to stand on my own two feet. But I’m afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills—like making burgers—because I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.

**TL;DR:** I’m struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh. I dream of being a father, but my lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes both me and my wife hesitant. I’m desperate for advice on building confidence and improving my life.";r/traumatoolbox;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/1fxtlmu/need_advice_for_overcoming_anxiety_and_life_skill/
2024-10-05 07:00:46;I've been messed up by school and now i struggle to study things;"Hello, there is a struggle in my life that i can't find info and resources on. I wasn't lucky with schools most of the time if not every time (i transferred like 4 times) i got beaten up by other kids(sorry i didn't clarify before edit) in my primary school and despised by teacher no matter how hard i tried.

 Then i got transferred to another school and it wasn't as bad as the previous one but i struggled to socialise with my peers, i was known as ""melancholic"" because when we were learning about 4 humors i was called that by teacher publically cause i ""cry all the time"". I was doing my best at studying once again but i was struggling a lot, especially with math. I hardly remember anything from that time other than sleepless homework-nights, my grandma's disappointed look, remarks on how lazy i am, and not being able to keep up when taking notes. I practically became an outcast in my class except for 3 people that wasn't really my main support or anything, i still didn't knew how to treat friends. I lost one after not visiting them when they were in hospital and they called me a crybaby and a coward later. I think about it a lot and what i should've done to support them..

Then i joined a community of vocalists and actors in my school and i finally felt like i found my purpose. I was writing poems, practiced singing, and even performed a couple of times, i really enjoyed it! I wasn't struggling, i wasn't dragged, but guided. I thought i finally became happy, it was my life. So i started to miss classes to engage with them as much as possible, my grades fell. I wasn't appearing frequently. And then i realized that i didn't wanted to, so even if there was no reason to not appear, i would just take a walk and buy myself a snack, or if i HAD to sit through it i would draw in my notebook or sleep. My mom wasn't happy. Teachers wasn't happy. They told me that i ""don't try hard enough"" and i felt really guilty for it, but i just knew that i couldn't take it anymore. Studying made me feel mentally and physically sick.

But then mom transferred me another school to ""make it easier for me"" and i lost it all. I lost my community, i stopped practicing my singing, i was once again at the point where i was bullied and there was no place to escape. A guy kept sneaking behind me on free time and scaring me when i tried to focus on my doodles. Every time. I tried to tell the teacher but all they said is ""you won't see them again in a couple of years"". So i tried to study again, but i was already suffering from a burnout and was far behind with every subject except english, and i fell off again. By that time i started to experience symptoms of derealization and suicidal thoughts. When i received a grade from a test and it was below avarge i felt like the most worthless thing in thee world and later that day made suicide attempt by going to the bridge above the rails with the intention of throwing myself off, but i couldn't do it. And also some guy was passing by and he told me that ""it's a teen's thing, it'll get better with time"" . So i believed him, because i really wanted to. When i told my mom about it she was like ""you know how much your fingers would've hurt burning? These wires are under high voltage. And we would be sad if something would happen to you"" i already developed some kind of fear towards her but after that i stopped trusting her completely, cause it implied that i had to go through all this because of someone else.

Then covid came. Best time of my life personally because there were temporarily no school. It became a bit easier to google stuff for homework, and i also spent a lot of time online (it's not like i didn't before which contributed to missing out, it just got extreme)

then school shut down, i got transferred again, and now it's my last year and i can't even appear in most of the classes on zoom-meetings anymore, everything about it hurts. Listening to things i don't understand, teachers asking me things i don't understand, them occasionally saying ""but you're not dumb you're just pretending"" or ""lazy"" or something.

I have social anxiety, i struggle with basic things like shopping and i can't count on a basic level. I keep looking for ways to make money with skills that i have with minimum human interaction (not successful) i can't be consistent with my art projects and keep scolding myself for it cause i don't know what i'm going to do after i graduate from school and i ""need to be successful now"". My mom agreed to pick me a therapist one time before, we established that i most likely have autism and adhd although this whole neurodivergence thing isn't well-known in my country and my mom knew but didn't get me a diagnosis when i was little because by law it isn't ""adult diseases"" which means it doesn't apply to you once you grow up and not only it won't be useful but it would've made things complicated for me in the future as she says. That therapist also told me stuff like ""it's not your fault it happened"" which made me feel a bit better but not too much, they kept encouraging me to decide on university and i had to take a break cus i started to feel sick again just from hearing it. I struggle to learn any new skill because i feel the pressure of getting good and fast but i can't keep myself consistent at all, every time i try to find a coach or maybe look for courses with useful info i get tired quickly and miss out or forget everything before i could recover. I'm terrified of the idea of finding a job or going to university cause i'm scared that i'll have to force myself to keep up every day whatever i like it or not (although ""like"" isn't exactly a right word, i just can't.) And even if i'll find something i like, i'll get tired again (my mom sended me to a music school one time so i could practice my singing more but i quickly got tired and the teacher kept asking me to learn 2 more instruments, so i quit. My mom kept reminding me of that like ""you're going to play with it for a bit and then abandon like that time?"" She then admitted that she was wrong for comparing it with anything but it seems like the scar remains) And i won't be able to rest. I want to find a ways to heal and enjoy my hobbies more than i currently am but every time i try to tell someone about this whole thing they keep saying that i just need to revisit the school program and get good. Is there any ways to cope with this and soothe the anxiety at least?

2024-08-10 22:56:40;A therapist isn’t necessarily dismissing your trauma by not giving you a PTSD diagnosis ;"Several times a week I see a post stating that someone’s therapist has decided not to give them a diagnosis for PTSD for xyz reason. The conclusion many people come to is that the therapist is dismissing their trauma, they are a bad therapist, or that they are simply uninformed. 

While it is incredibly important to advocate for yourself, we are also not entitled to a diagnosis simply because we think we have it. There are so many differential diagnoses that carry similar symptoms to PTSD and are trauma related disorders that may be a better fit. You may also have gone through a trauma, have symptoms, but not quite meet the criteria for PTSD. 


I urge people to really consider how they feel about their therapist overall and how they respond to their pain when it’s brought up in session. Recognize a pattern of dismissing and go from there. 

And it’s worth considering in the comments section that more harm then good can come from telling people whom you don’t know that their therapist is awful and dismissing them without a fair amount of evidence for it. Because if that’s not true, the person will carry the belief that yet another person doesn’t care about them or their trauma. Even if the therapist does care and is still working through the trauma and symptoms of it. 

Of course, advocate for yourself, seek a second opinion if needed. Always be aware if a therapist IS dismissing you. But please recognize a therapist’s job is to decipher all your symptoms and give you a diagnosis that’s the best fit. And sometimes, it may not be the diagnosis you think you have or are wanting to have. ";r/ptsd;248;187;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1eouzef/a_therapist_isnt_necessarily_dismissing_your/

2024-04-10 01:54:22;I was raped by a woman - I’m a man. I feel invisible and invalid.;"I don’t want to go in too in-depth, but I was raped via envelopment in 2022 by a woman. 

I said stop multiple times, she got aggressive and essentially pinned me down and continued when I tried to stop her. I didn’t want to wake her roommate up or make her more mad than she already was. I kinda just gave up and embraced the nauseating pain.

The rape only lasted around 15-30 seconds to maybe a minute, but it felt like an eternity.

I’ve had a very hard time confronting what happened that night. It goes against society’s view of rape and it took me a long time to even admit that I was raped. I got diagnosed with PTSD, spoke with RAINN’s chatline and have been in EMDR therapy. I self harmed for the first time in 2023 to cope with the terrible memories. I considered suicide on multiple occasions.

I’m doing better now, but I can’t help but feel isolated because my case is considered “rare.” I’ve read countless threads about how men are only ever raped by other men, and how it’s a statistical outlier. I’ve seen people say that it’s not nearly as bad or the same as a woman getting raped.

I still have never been able to feel like myself against after that event - even after therapy. I lost my sense of self, my masculinity, and my safety.

I feel invisible, alone and rejected by this world.

2023-09-17 09:47:43;I was stabbed 18 times and pushed off a cliff, and that was the easy part;"I was attacked while hiking in Honolulu in 2009. An individual had a psychotic break and thought Japanese men wearing blue were government agents sent to kill him. I was stabbed 18 times, mostly in the head and throat, and pushed off the top of Koko Crater. I fell 100 feet. I broke my neck, fractured my skull, both my lungs collapsed, my left lung was punctured, my liver and diaphragm were stabbed, an artery in my temple was severed.
I lost 5 pints of blood. I was lucky to survive, there have been a few challenges along the way. 

I was rear-ended twice while recovering from the broken neck. I was betrayed by the justice system. My attacker was acquitted due to temporary insanity and was put in a mental hospital.
Just 3 years after trying to murder 2 people, he was granted permission to take college courses at a nearby community college unescorted.
He was released in 2018 and gets free healthcare for life. 

In 2021, I was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder that causes complete fat loss.
Every ounce of fat disappears and your organs slowly shut down. I haven’t laid on my back in 2 years and I haven’t sat voluntarily in 2 years because my butt fat is gone. Most of my life is spent laying on my stomach. 

It won’t surprise you that I have PTSD, what might surprise you is that the trauma from my stabbing is a drop in the bucket compared to the trauma of chronic illness. I survived and even overcame maybe the most violent attempted murder ever committed, and yet I’m taken down by a rare metabolic disorder. Life without fat is exponentially more painful than getting stabbed and pushed off a cliff. Crazy, right? 

People ask how I’ve survived all this trauma. The answer is simple: I’m half Japanese and half  Scandinavian. That means I’m a samurai AND Viking. It’s hard to kill one, but I’m both! 

This is a challenging situation and I worry about the future, but I post this to remind you of the strength of the human spirit. I hope this part inspires you: that lunatic tried to stab my brain 6 times. What did I do with that brain? I went back to school and I graduated with a 4.0 and $90,000 in scholarships. I became a published author and wrote and spoke about my survival throughout Hawaii and California. I knit thousands of scarves, beanies, and potholders and sold them to pay for medical bills. I fought for victim’s rights, and I supported victims and survivors through their trials. I did all these things with PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and severe chronic pain.

I think everything contributed to the actual moment that I lost it. I realized along with the current ptsd diagnosis that my childhood wasn’t normal,(verbally abusive narcissistic controlling parents) i feel like i’m working through 6 major events in my life that are also traumatic but I never addressed them until I was diagnosed in 2019 for an event that happened then.

 Do you all feel like this is a normal process of therapy? Like I’ll need to process everything first until I can heal from the actual major event?";r/ptsd;277;102;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/16htzic/did_therapy_for_your_ptsd_make_you_realize_more/
2023-07-29 20:40:16;My patient died a violent death and I think I have PTSD from it;"Tldr: He suffered a cardiac tamponade that led to sudden onset hypotension, and his IV got pulled out, which led to hypovolemic shock.

The patient had come to the hospital, complaining of severe chest pain and weakness, and had said he suffered clots before, so he was given blood thinners to treat it. Around 12:50 AM i got a call from his room. It was his wife, screaming about excessive bleeding and her husband throwing up. 

I stepped into his room, and it was like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I truly do not mean to crassly compare it to something like but I have no idea how else to express it. As soon as I stepped into his room I went into instant panic mode because of what I saw. I froze up. My mind went blank.

His bed was so saturated in blood  that it went through all of his linens and was covering the mattress. His blankets were so soaked that it was dripping on to the floor. His gown was completely black because he was so bleeding out so much. His IV had been torn out of his arm and he was just pouring blood everywhere.

I tried so hard to stop it. The floor was slick with his blood that I fell and nearly split my own head open trying to get to the emergency staff button. I tried so hard. The towels. The gauze. There just so much bleeding that it went through everything.

His face turned so white. I had never seen anything so terrifying in my life. All i can see when I close my eyes is the color draining from his face.

His blood pressure went from 127/79 to 42/30. He was dead at 1:35 AM.

I don't know what to do. I've changed my clothes. I've written this out. I cried. But all I can think of is all that blood. His dying face. He was shaking so much.

He came in and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism when he had a cardiac tamponade and we gave him blood thinners for a clot that didn't exist.

I can't help but think we killed him. I can't stop thinking what if I had gotten there a few minutes earlier? What if I hadn't froze at the door? Maybe I could have prevented his IV from being ripped out. Maybe I could hace saved his life. My mind is tearing itself apart. I feel sick thinking about it. I had his blood running down my arms. The sound of his,wife screaming at me to stop his bleeding.

I don't know how to deal with this. I'm shaking, and all I can think about is his face and all that blood. I can't sleep. I can't think about anything else.";r/ptsd;260;72;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/15crcs8/my_patient_died_a_violent_death_and_i_think_i/

2023-01-22 12:38:42;Why did getting pierced allow me to release trauma?;"I really don't understand what just happened. 

Background: abandoned at birth, adopted into a cult. Grew up with daily physical (not sexual), spiritual,  emotional, and mental abuse by adoptive mom. Lost first daughter due to incompetent medical staff response to medical trauma. Formally diagnosed with : ASD level 1(formerly known as aspergers), adhd Pi, and severe ptsd. I also have another rare genetic disease that creates other physiological problems for me. SWM in 40's.

With the above you can likely imagine how much I've struggled with anger, resentment,  and suicidal thoughts. It's been a highly unpleasant life. I didn't realize this for a long time because I had nothing to compare to, but my body was always stiff and tense.

4 days ago, I did something that surprised everyone around me and went and got my ear pierced.  The strangest thing happened.  When the needle went thru my ear lobe, it was like the tension ballon popped.  I've been more relaxed and happier over the last 4 days than at any other time in my life. I didn't know this was possible.

2022-11-21 02:54:54;Callum is a rapist;"I'm so fed up of being silent and protecting my rapist. So, here's everything. (On mobile, please excuse formatting/rambling/spelling). I'm F26, live in  Kent (UK).

Callum is a rapist. Everyone knows he is a rapist. Everyone is ignoring that he is a rapist.

He's my cousin but we were pretty much raised together, so he was like a brother to me. We are the same-ish age. I'm sure it was during the summer holidays, because we had been to Colchester Zoo during the day and he was staying over, as he always did during the school holidays. We used to sleep top-and-tail until we were too big for a single bed, but I had recently got a double bed (which I was very excited about, so grown up!) so there wasn't room for the fold-away bed on the floor (as my bed and furniture took up too much room). No big deal, we had been sharing a bed all our lives, he was like my brother, after all. I was really looking forward to talking until we fell asleep, like we used to do. 

I was 15 at the time, I had come out as a lesbian at 13 and had my first girlfriend at the time. Naturally, I was completely in love and set on marrying this girl (as teenagers are), because how could I not have met the love of my life at 13? I was so excited to tell Callum all about my wonderful, perfect girlfriend, how we were going to finish school and have a lovely little house in the country and grow roses in the garden etc etc. He'd probably heard this story a thousand times at this point, but I was a teenager in love. 

I put my favourite nightie on as we got ready for bed, brushed my teeth and got tucked into bed with some crap on TV. He didn't really ever wash or clean his teeth, but that was just him. Not very bright or hygienic, but it was him. We laid there with the TV on, talking about school, how unfair our teachers were, how amazing my totally future wife was. He asked if I had a photo of her, I was so proud to show her off because who wouldn't want to see her, right? I had a cutesy little picture on my phone of us in our school uniforms, heads resting on the other, holding hands and smiling. I loved that picture so much. 

We eventually fell asleep, me staying up a little longer to make sure I'd sent and received a goodnight from my gf. I went to sleep. 

At some point in the night, I'm not really sure when, I woke up laying on my right-hand side, feeling like my left brest was being groped. I was confused and sleepy, assumed Callum had placed his hand there by mistake whilst turning over in his sleep, or something. I removed his hand, placed it carefully down, and turned over to go back to sleep. His hand appeared again. Again, I removed it but, this time, it came straight back. I grabbed his wrist and turned over to tell him to stop but he started forcefully kissing me. A lot of tongue and uncleaned teeth just being pressed into my mouth. It was disgusting, I still remember the taste and smell. 

I shoved him away and went to wipe my mouth and he bit down on my left brest. It hurt so I shoved him away, he tried to bite the other but I shoved him and turned away from him, trying to get away. He pulled me onto my back, ripping my nightie, and started fumbling around trying to remove my underwear (briefs and bra). Everything I wanted to say, to shout, to scream just built up in my throat like there was some sort of dam in the way and it just kept getting more and more blocked up until I felt like I couldn't breathe.

I crossed my legs as hard as I could and he ripped my underwear away. It really hurt, felt like rope burn where the stitching of the underwear had been pulled through the joint between my leg/genitals. I flinched and it was enough time for him to force his hand between my thighs. He went between groping my genitals to trying to lever my legs apart. I thought I was strong enough but. He was stronger. 

He forced his penis into my vagina maybe three or four times before I was able to push his face away and turn away from him. I went to get off of the bed and he dragged me back by my hips. He nearly got me onto my back so I stopped trying to get away and just focused everything I had in me to clamp my legs shut. He gave up trying to force my legs open and forced me more onto my front, pushing his penis between my thighs. I tucked my legs up a little, trying to stop him, and he forced his penis straight into my anus. It hurt so much that I started crying. I decided to stop fighting and just wait for it to stop because at least he couldn't get me pregnant there. 

I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like forever. It was probably only a few minutes. I just laid there when he was done. I didn't know what to do. Eventually, he got up and left the room. I stayed for a little longer, I don't really know why. 

Eventually I got up, felt semen running down my legs and just cried more. I went to the bathroom and cleaned up, there was a little blood but not too much. 

When his mum came to pick him up I told her what he had done. I had been abused before when I was about 5/6 and didn't say at the time and the guy got away with it, I didnt want Callum to get away with it. I showed her the bite mark on my brest, I showed her the marks on my chest. She demanded I go to the doctors, gave me a very strict warning to not speak when there and that she would speak for me, and she had the doctor examine me to prove I wasn't a virgin. I wasn't allowed to talk so the doctor didn't see the other marks. I didn't get to show her. The doctor told my aunt I wasn't a virgin, that I had had sex ""very recently"". What she didn't see or mention was that I had a small rip in my anus. I guess she wasn't really looking there and so she probably didn't actually see it. 

I was sent home and told to not speak about it. My bed was stripped and I was sent back to my room. I slept on that bed for nearly 10 years. I still sleep in that bedroom. I'm in it now, as I type. 

I was having counselling for the previous abuse, it was my last session that week, and I was told not to tell my counsellor. I told the counsellor. When the police arrived my nan (who had raised me, along with my granddad) told me that, if I spoke to the police, they would take me into care. I already felt like I was losing everything, I didn't want to be taken away too. I told them to go away, that I wasn't going to speak with them. I wish I had. Every day, I wish I had. 

It was done, the police had gone away, it was over. I thought it was over. My aunt flew in one day and wrapped her hands around my throat, screaming in my face, asking me if I was going to be a victim forever, screaming that I would have fought harder if I didn't want to be raped. I shouldn't have been in a position where I had to fight to not be raped. It started to go black and I was just so relieved that it was over, it was going to be over, I wasn't going to have to live with it. But she stopped. She let go. I saw my grandparents. Neither of them said or did anything to stop her. They let her choke me and scream in my face. 

I was told I was going to live with my mum for a little bit, we never really got on (on account of me not feeling like she cared for me because she gave me up), but I wasn't told why I was going. My mum and I fought a lot. I told her that she's my mum and maybe she should ""just fucking do something"" about the fact that I had been raped. She shouted into my face that she wasn't going to do anything, my aunt is her sister, after all. Apparently her sister (both have always hated each other) and her rapist nephew were her priority. I shouted at her, saying that I didn't get why I had to live with her, and she screamed ""You're pushing your granddad, *MY DAD*, into an early grave"" (he was sick). 

I kept quiet and started self harming. A lot. I went back to school, I kept blades in my pockets for when I wanted to harm. I missed two periods. Maybe three, but it was definitely at least two. So I started putting disinfectant in my water bottles. It stripped the skin in my mouth and really hurt my throat (I have really pitted tonsils now so, you know, don't do it), but it would just make me a bit sick/unwell if I only put a little it. I started getting really bad stomach cramps, which I attributed to the disinfectant. It suddenly felt like I had wet myself, but it was blood. Everywhere. All over my kilt (school uniform), all over the chair, I excused myself from class.

I went to the toilets and sat on the toilet, vomiting and in so much pain. Huge blood clots just kept falling out, so much blood running out it felt like I was peeing but in the wrong place. After a while of crying/bleeding/vomiting/the worst pain I've ever felt, I went to the sick room and said I was having a really bad period. They gave me some pads and a hot water bottle, told me to wait out the day in the sickroom as there wasn't much time left and I had blood all over my kilt. It stopped and I just carried on. I guess I just figured it was the disinfectant, so it was self inflicted and was finally going to die, like I wanted. Now, I'm not sure that was it. I think I may have induced a miscarriage. But, I don't know. I don't like putting much thought into it. 

The school decided I needed help when I went to one of the teachers and begged her for help, showing her the cuts over every part of my arms/torso/back (where I could reach). Because I had lost control in that cutting session (I didn't usually do it that bad) and was certain I was going to end up dead if I didn't get help. I was also scared someone at home was going to see it and I was going to get in trouble, so figured I'd get in there first and ask my teacher for help. 

I ended up with more (crappy) counselling. The put it down to the fact that my granddad (who was the closest I had to a dad) was sick. He died was diagnosed with and died of cancer shortly after I was raped. Which I blamed myself for (on account of having it screamed in my face). 

So I stayed quiet. The family blamed me, ignored me, called me a liar, left me alone with him multiple times. And I stayed quiet. I was so scared that if I spoke, my nan would die too. 

About a year ago Callum turned up to my house and I lost it. I wanted to kill him. I was going to kill him. And I didn't care much for anyone who got between us. I knew where the knives were, I knew where he was. I wanted to kill him. Maybe myself after, not sure. But I wanted him dead. That much I knew. And it terrified me. So I shut myself away and played loud music until the ""kill him"" thoughts went away. I then sought help from another cousin (not his sister) because I was scared of the anger I felt. 

I told her what had happened to me, didn’t say names or specifics, I just wanted help with the anger. She told my aunt (Callum's mum). My aunt phoned and made threats against my life, my nan actually stood up for me. So now my aunt isn't talking to my nan and hasn't been for about a year. This keeps being thrown in my face. 

Anyway, after everything blew up it was revealed that the whole family knew. They all knew. And they all left me alone with him. They all let me face it completely alone. They all let me down. They still are letting me down. 

All the family were buzzing and talking constantly about how wonderful it is that Callum was getting married this year, how wonderful and happy his life was. How wonderful the wedding was in August. 

His wife died this week. Cancer. She was 24. She didn't deserve to die. She definitely didn't deserve to die like that. Her family didn't deserve to lose her. But I can't help but feel that he deserves it. He wasn't there when she died. He missed it. And I hope he never gets a day's peace for that. At least, as he watches his world fall apart, the family aren't screaming in his face that it's his fault.

I do not feel sorry for him. I will not feel sorry for him, I'm physically incapable. May it break him completely. May he feel a shred of the complete worthlessness he put me through. May he wake up and decide life isn't worth living, as he did to me. May he not survive it. 

Callum is a rapist. He will never be anything more. He is part of the lowest form of human scum. I will never be silent again. I will never stop saying it, until all the world knows.

2022-08-11 03:03:24;I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support;"Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.

I'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.

But somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.

Then on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.

It was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.

I took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.

My manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically ""either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.""

Three of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were ""triggering"" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.

I have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been ""too much to handle"" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just ""feel like a burden"", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.

My support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, ""Great. Scared another one away.""

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.

I don't even know what I'm asking for. I'll take advice, or even just acknowledgement. If you've read this far, thank you. I just needed to be heard and I didn't know where else to turn.";r/ptsd;339;96;https://reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/wl5qpr/i_survived_a_mass_shooting_4_weeks_ago_im_an_icu/
2022-06-19 14:07:17;I didn't go to war;"I was telling a friend of mine who is in the army I feel like a fraud when I say I have PTSD cause it's not like I saw someone die. He laughed and said: When you go to war, you expect to see people die. When you are born, you expect to be taken care of. You sign up to go to war and you had no ability to remove yourself and you didn't sign up for that. Years and years of childhood abuse will always be worse because your brain wasn't developed. 
It made me feel better with my diagnosis. Like PTSD isn't just a thing soldiers get, it's something that happens to you when traumatic shit fucks you over.

2022-03-17 23:29:59;How do I get away from my abuser when I'm fully dependent on him;"My mom got married to my stepdad when I was about 10 or 11. Soon after, the first stages of grooming started. I didn't even know that what was happening was grooming until a few months ago when it was talked about in my psychology class. The abuse went on for about 8 or 9 years. I'm 19 now. It was severe I think but maybe I'm just being a bit dramatic about the whole thing. My mom had been diagnosed with breast cancer and got a double mastectomy and hysterectomy and after that, things got really bad. He made up fake people over the internet and was really good at it. I had a bestfriend, a boyfriend(that cheated on me every so often), Bestfriends stepdad(which she did stuff with also and who would sext me), boyfriends bestfriend(also tried to sext often), and a few other side characters like my boyfriends aunt that he messed around with and the girls he cheated on me with. I had these relationships for three years before finding out they were all fake. He also made another fake person, which was really just an identity we used to be able to talk about various things without anyone getting suspicious or seeing a message about sex under the contact ""dad"", and he used that fake person to get both (real) boyfriends I had to cheat on me. The actual sexual abuse usually happened through ""deals"" where we would agree on something he wanted to do and I would get something in return whether it be money, something off my amazon wishlist, a few more hours with my boyfriend, really anything I wanted. But sometimes it would be to get out of trouble and I have realized that I would often get in trouble for things I shouldn't have just so I would make a deal to keep my phone or avoid whatever punishment it was. And what was really fucked up is that I would get in trouble for sending nudes or sexting with the fake people(him) and would make deals to get out of the punishments. I think what really messed me up though and kinda brain-washed me is that if I didn't follow through with a deal to get out of a punishment, I would have to get that punishment and if I didn't follow through for something I wanted, I wouldn't get that thing. So there was always a negative consequence for not doing a deal after agreeing to it. He would make me feel bad and say ""so you're bailing on me?"" ""just say it. You're bailing on me""  I lost my virginity to him the day before my 13th birthday. The whole thing is terrible but for some reason I love him. Maybe its a trauma bond or maybe I was just doomed from the start. I CRAVED a dad when I was little. My mom and I lived with my grandparents until she got married and I never knew who my real dad was. When I did finally meet him he ended up being a deadbeat piece of shit. I quickly clung on to my new dad and my mom fell into a deep depression so she wasnt really there most of the time. All I had was him. It really was the perfect setup for him to do this to me. Now I'm at a point where I know what happened to me was abuse and grooming and I need to report him. I don't want to because I really do love him so much as terrible as that is. But I am completely dependant on him. If he goes away I lose my ability to finish college, my home, probably all my pets (which maybe I deserve because I made a deal for every single one of them), I lose my car, my phone, my laptop and ipad which i heavily rely on for school(and also made a deal for), I lose my little brother(his biological son), and I'm sure I would lose my mom. She would hate me and probably disown me. I think my whole family would. She has suspected it before and so did my grandparents. My grandparents even filed a cps report once. I know my older sister has suspected it too. I'm sure I'm just spoiled since I've literally always gotten whatever I wanted and I know it sounds dumb to be worried about losing things like a laptop and phone. I'm sorry for that. I just don't really know what to do. Maybe I should just push through till grad school when I can really start living my own life. We don't make deals very much anymore but he doesn't let me forget it. He's always asking to make one and the more time goes on, the better the reward for making a deal where I don't have to do very much. It's hard to resist especially since I don't have money or gas now that we've pretty much stopped. Anyway sorry for how long this is. I probably didn't even need to say all this. I never get to talk about it. Any advice on what to do is appreciated.";r/traumatoolbox;37;8;https://reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/tgctdd/how_do_i_get_away_from_my_abuser_when_im_fully/

2021-08-12 04:10:51;Mechanism of injury;"For folks who haven't spend time with their heads buried in an EMT/trauma text book:
Mechanism of injury is a special consideration a first responder makes, while first arriving at a scene or during PT assessment. 
An example:
 You find a 12 year old, non responsive x3, in the prone next to a 12 foot ladder, vitals within normal range. 
 WHILE you may not have ANY DIRRECT PROOF/WITNESS to the child falling from the ladder, it is prudent to protect the child's spine, suspecting a possible injury, evaulate, focusing on possible head injuries, pay attention to changes in vitals, due to possible internal bleeding, and transport ASAP. 
This is pretty  consistent amongst Healthcare providers, without running test as ""rule outs"". 
WHY, OH WHY, would the VA not consider the same MECHANISM OF INJURY when it comes to trauma related to war?
Other than ""professional oppionons"", PTSD has no ""diagnostic tool"".
And many TBI can't be detected by modern diagnostic CT scan/MRI. 
BUT what happened when you have a CLEAR MECHANISM OF INJURY?
IN THIS CASE, A SOLDIER THAT SERVED 4 TOURS/ 3 of which were on line units....why does the PROBABILITY OF INJURY not matter as inconclusive diagnosis, possibly biased doctors? 
What is more likely? A soldier returning for years of combat, UNSCATHED? OR with the invisible wounds that take the lives of 24 veterans a day, cause 1 out of 4 homeless to be VETERANS, and an epidemic of post-service drug/alcohol addiction. 
The fact I Brought this up, instead of Doctors, policy makers and VA employees, is another failure of the VA system. 
I would RATHER 5 people scam the system, to save ONE AUTHENTICLY broken veteran, in need of help and support (especially, when 21 trillion dollars can go unaccounted for 3 years ago, and the only response from congress was *shrugs* and the media covered it for LITTERALLY one day. 
The system is based on a scam, there is NO justified reason to try to ""fix it"" on the backs of men and women who SCENCERLY NEED HELP after serving their country.";r/PTSDCombat;6;3;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/p2l1xm/mechanism_of_injury/

I live in Okinawa Japan. Have been tentatively diagnosed with PTSD and the Japanese doc referred me to onbase mental health. But because of the covid restrictions and I am only seen as a space available patient, it is hard to get appointments. It's already been two months since I've been trying to get one. I am wondering if there are better options for me to get treatment?

I would prefer a doc that speaks english, takes American insurance, and the doctors do not get switched out in have to rehash everything to them. And is also more timely on giving appointments.

Should I try one of the psychiatric apps like Amwell? Or to see a doc locally bypassing the military doctors? I just don't know what to do. And could really use some advice.";r/PTSDCombat;2;5;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/ogoii5/need_advise_on_getting_treatment/
2021-06-29 21:31:03;A post of venting.;"Not even sure if this is really the right place but it's tied to my PTSD  so here goes.

TLDR: I have my first psychiatrist appointment today.  Wife wants to be there and I don't want her there for ""reasons"". I told her this yesterday and she seemed to accept it.  She brought it up again this morning before I left for work and  I snapped at her for it. 

&#x200B;

Back story  I got out in 06 and did my own thing for the past 10 years before meeting my wife   no help from the VA cuz ""I'm Fine""   but a revolving door of employment,  not really forming or building any bonds with old friends or family,  and the temporary nature of construction jobs being the only reason I was able to ""maintain employment"".  Enter  2016    Met an amazing woman who is too good for me  and her wonderful but still at times emotionally and mentally taxing child  (Now 15 years old. Probably because me and the kid are eerily similar despite a lack of shared genes.)   2 years later were married and she gave birth to our first child together then a little over a  year later she gives me another child.  At this point we have had some pretty taxing challenges to our marriage (Toxic family on both sides,  a contractors tweaked out worker fell through our living room ceiling after installing a new HVAC incredibly shoddily.

 Roll forward to where our second kid is old enough to start walking.  They pull down some shit and hurt themselves, no blood but  my Hulk mind overrides common sense, ""Smash what hurt spawnling!"".  So now we're down an end table and My kids are afraid of me. 

 My mom begins pestering me about getting help for my issues and I deny I have them  that lasts about a year and finally I realized she was right and for the sake of my family I did need help so I reached out to a vet center and started seeing a counselor.  That helped though even now I still hold back some shit that I should tell him about.  January of 2020 I get my PTSD diagnosis.  A year later I'm talking bi weekly with my counselor. but haven't seen or had any sort of intake with VA mental health. 

Finally in march I have an intake for what I thought was to start getting me on some MH meds.  (MJ Isn't an option as I work on a federal jobsite) It was an intake for counseling , I was at the end when finally all the pieces fell into place where they realize I'm not wanting a different counselor but was in  need of  a medication appointment.   That was finally set up in early July, then that was cancelled and rescheduled for  late July.  This was not a boon to my mental health for sure.   

I eventually between April and now I wound up taking some GW (Generic Welbutrin) for an unrelated condition and I found it to be very beneficial for my MH.  So That time frame was looking less daunting to endure.  Well In late  May I noticed the effectiveness of the GW was beginning to wane.  I was becoming more irritable( faster to snap,  and the ""Hulk smash"" urges were showing up again but weren't being acted on)  Then I had a Loud vocal argument  with my elderspawn (15) year old ..  they drew back their fist like they wanted to hit me I told them to do it .. like  a part of me knew I need to get hit for my actions.  They did it  And I told them to do it again and they did.  I didn't retaliate I didn't even want to I wanted them to keep hitting me.  When I came to my senses I was embarrassed  and couldn't apologize enough and kind of shut myself away for the rest of the day,   The next day my Middlespawn was looking at me with a lot of weariness.   I asked if they were scared of me .. they didn't say yes but they backed away with a look that I took as fear on their face.   My Children are afraid of me .. Dark thoughts filled me in that moment and I took that anguish I felt in that moment out on myself. Self-flagellation  would be the best way to describe it and again shut myself off for another few hours wallowing in self pity and disgust thinking my family would be better off without me and that I wish I had never made it back from Iraq.

The next day was Monday and I made use of the privacy I had at work to call the crisis line as there were still some lingering self harm ideations floating around in my head.  Per the suggestions of the people there I contacted  my local clinic and explained my situation.   They got me in for an in-person  appointment today by moving around or cancelling some training or I think that is what they said.  

So in about 6 hours I get to go and try be honest with myself and the Psychiatrist and hope I don't get put into a  Involuntary hold. If I am I don't want my wife there to see that .. that is why I don't want her there.";r/PTSDCombat;5;4;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/oa8bzh/a_post_of_venting/

2021-04-06 10:10:05;Vet with a bit of success.;"Hello everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve taken time to respond to other post, offer my support and suggestions.  

I feel like this is the moment to share my story.

I’m a 36 year old veteran of operation Iraqi freedom. Ever sense I left theater I was never the same. After a tour in Korea I took alcohol to a whole new level, and after I departed serving. I just got worse. 
Now there were some ups. I created a business, I had two beautiful daughters, and met my soul mate. 
All of that being said I still couldn’t be happy. 

In the past year and half to two years, I have completely hit the bottom. Had to pivot business just so it could survive. Had a long up hill battle and was drinking myself to sleep. Oh and that soul mate? I became emotionally abusive, she took care of me, loved me unconditionally. Picked me up off the floor every time I was that drunk, and stood by my through every single suicide attempt, and I destroyed her, and I destroyed her life. 

In this warpath I discovered a brewery of other veterans. This guys had found treatment. Unfortunately it’s treatment that the VA doesn’t cover. So after another complete slip I dove into my pocket and paid for treatment.

I was not happy about doing some “hippy shit” these guys and this Dr put me on clinical ketamine treatment, meditation, and journaling what I’m grateful for. The first treatment was a horrible experience with amazing results, and it didn’t take. Sober for a few days and back to being a miserable asshole. 
Reason why? If I told you something would you listen? And that’s exactly why. I had more important things then to follow up with the personal after care. 

So it goes 4 treatments later. I finally get it. I’ve been sober, I’m journaling, and I found the cause of my diagnosis. Fear, when we crossed that berm we were all scared to death. It’s only natural. But there were more deep seeded issues outside of Iraq that I discovered in treatment. 

It goes without saying, you’re a special kind of fucked up to sign up in a time of war, or a special kind of stupid? Either way, Iraq and alcohol were just the icing and sprinkles on that cake that was my life. My childhood of abuse and abandonment was the cake itself. 

So what do you do? How do you “fix” it? 

You forgive and you forget and you love. In my case I had to start with my mother on Easter Sunday, I wrote her a polite beautiful letter, no passive aggression, no questions as to why. I thanked her, I wouldn’t be where I am today had this not happened to me. I told her I loved her, wished her no I’ll will, and hoped she had peace. 

We can’t change the past, we can not change others, sometimes we can’t changes the situation that may or may not be from the cause of our own actions. How ever we can change ourselves, and I’ll say that’s been my uphill battle all along. 

I never forgave myself, I never loved myself. 

So what do you do next. Well I wrote 18 year old me a letter and said the same. 

Keep in mind when you dig down deep in that heart of yours and truly forgive someone, this means you forgive them. You’re done bringing up the story and situation. You find love in your heart and you drive forward. 

I feel as if a 10 ton ruck sack has been lifted from my back. After doing this. I’ve let go of all control, people around you might hurt you, that was never their intentions. So let people in your life, and love them.

Most of all love yourself

This isn’t the last chapter of my journey. Here shortly I’ll be given clinical psilocybin, MDMA, and DMT in one weekend. 

If you’ve read this far please feel free to ask me anything. I hope if you’re hurting you know you’re not alone, and I’m sure my actions might even work without drugs.";r/PTSDCombat;20;8;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/ml1103/vet_with_a_bit_of_success/
2021-04-03 07:47:25;"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just replacement of one one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""";"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

Borderlines are highly stigmatised in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. I posted it on r/BPD first ([here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/miwc67/please_do_yourself_a_favour_and_replace_the_word/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and now I am here: the place where I feel the most understood.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.

*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**";r/CPTSD;2446;102;https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/miwsf7/please_do_yourself_a_favour_and_replace_the_word/
2021-03-01 15:08:43;101st ABN and a decade of lost time;"This is my first time speaking about this online and needless to say I'm skeptical but maybe someone will find a use for it, and maybe it'll help me take some of this off my mind.

I was getting out of the army in 2013 and had to speak to a psych about deployment issues that I was having, I was being med boarded so it was almost a guarantee that I'd be speaking to them anyways. I had two sessions with a counselor to see what I felt like I needed to talk about with the Capt. that was in charge of dealing with psych. Both meetings went well, I felt like she listened and was at least responsive with her answers and comments. I then spoke to the Capt. and for the next 30 mins. I was berated and belittled, my family, friends, fellow soldiers shit upon. I couldn't believe what was happening, but being that I didn't want to hit an officer, or risk losing an honorable discharge I just took it, shouldn't have but I did. Fast forward to the VA rating and they say I have an anxiety and depression issue but rate it as really a non-issue, 10%.

I get out of the army, go through job after job for 10 years now, get a 4 year degree, and keep shifting jobs about once every 8 months because I just cant deal with common issues that everyone else seems so well adjusted to. I can't get over the idea that I'm just unhappy with being unhappy, I know I hate the feeling but I know that this is just the norm now, that this is my life.

I've now been working for a city, doing mostly manual labor but still moving between spots, streets, parks, buildings, and now I'm requesting to go back to parks. I'll explain that in a little bit.

I can't control my responses to people, and I can't help yelling at an empty room, blind rage that I work myself into, that makes me just punch, throw, hit, anything violent you can think of but never towards anyone, just mad at the situation. I'm stuck, I have a house, but all I want to do is sell it and live in my car, I want to move away but I can't help but feel like I'm stuck, I want to do something fun but nothing interests me anymore. These last 10 years have been on repeat for me, and I finally had a break down, cried for the first time and have been a wreck since, it's been a week, I know I have no control over my emotions but that's what I was trained to do, just like many others; BURY EVERYTHING.

I now have to request for reasonable accommodation (ADA) to get myself out of an insanely toxic position. A friend that I've known for well over 10 years is now working me out of my job (he's my boss). I know, weird situation but I felt that he, having a behavioral health degree and knowing what I'd been through would be willing to work with me, not the case. I wish I were being skeptical but after the review I received from him, he mentions multiple times that he'd be happy to help me find another job somewhere else. Not dwelling on that but I know I enjoyed my previous position and there's and opening, so I'm asking for time to improve and a chance to show it by getting out of a nasty spot.

I've now gone in to have an initial eval. for PTSD with the VA and they tell me likely it's my thyroid, that my numbers are slightly off, so that has to be the case! (Don't bother looking at the eval., I'm pretty sure I hit a bingo on all cards they showed). I have a problem with this because I'm told to call my physician, what physician? I've called to get one for weeks now and get no response, so even if they wanted to claim thyroid I can't even prove them wrong. ""We want to get you into the PTSD Clinic so you can talk with them and get your diagnosis to start helping yourself,"" but have yet to hear from that as well.

Asking for help has been the worst situation I remember in many, many years and being let down when you need it the most, well that's just hard to take, hard to swallow. I hear all the ""it'll get better, give it time"" catch phrases, but I'm left with an empty stomach and an empty bowl.

Granted, this has really turned into a rant fest but my point stands, I hope if someone else is going through the same type of situation, to know, that you're not alone, those words feel hollow, even coming from me, but truly you are not alone. I can't say that things will get better, but I can say that the VA system is broken and I can only hope that it works for someone. There are an awful lot of men and women that need their help but I have to believe that system works for someone, maybe.

I appreciate your time reading, and good luck to you all, in all your endeavors.

We're not sure how long he's been off of them, and he's definitely going down hill. Very disorientated, almost half asleep. Today he deficated on the toilet, not in it.

Where do we go from here? He won't willingly go to the VA (Here in Denver), or take his meds. There is a very dark side to his disability. He has done so great for the last 2 years (mind you, he's been down and out for the majority of his life, post-war). 

Is there protocols for the Police, or Hospitals (VA or otherwise) for situations like this? Any info or suggestions would be hugely appreciated.";r/PTSDCombat;9;8;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/lex7x1/need_advice_from_vets_with_ptsd/

2020-08-14 13:10:50;My dad is a US Army combat vet ('68-'72) and I'm looking for family resources;"Hi, I'm the 31 year old daughter of a retired combat vet living with PTSD and I'm looking for some help finding family resouces; The VA website didn't look very promising. Specifically I'm looking for peer support groups aimed toward helping the families and adult children of vets with PTSD. 

My father has not been active duty since he was discharged honorably in '72 but the trauma experienced during his service has continued to dominate not only his life and the lives of my mother, sisters and extended family.

My mother is his primary care giver and she's always taken 100% of the responsibility regarding his health and care. Recently with COVId they have not been taking the confinement well, and I'm worried that she is becoming depressed, something we have all battled with. Anyone who has ever loved or lived with a combat vet knows how isolating it can be and how helpless you can feel. 

He was re-classified 100% disabled around 2006 from his service in Vietnam and only then did he start to be treated for his PTSD. We as a family, have never openly discussed his diagnosis and how it has effected us. Its still very openly feared and avoided, a topic to only be discussed on his terms.

Ideally there are already peer support groups in every city but if not, I'm willing to start one.

2020-08-02 14:33:27;My fiancee committed suicide a couple of weeks after I made the temporary move back home to be near my father while he died of cancer.;"I had been dating my so for almost six years. I had lived with her for most of that time. We were engaged; just waiting for this summer, after she finished grad school, to close the deal. 

It was never easy, but we made it work. Both of us came from fucked up households, and we were certainly both broken people in the beginning. But we worked through it, and both of us gradually became better, more stable people. Never perfect, but always better. 

This last fall my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and in february he was given max two months to live. Through some awful circumstances my mother perpetrated, I wasn't allowed to see him after I was twelve, so I decided to leave my so in her college town to move near him, which was about 10 hours away. 

I took care of her. Did everything for her. I thought that she could handle me leaving for the couple of months, but she couldn't. Two weeks after I left she committed suicide. I was the last person she talked to. She had a few stones we collected played out in front of her, and my scarf sat on the couch beside her. 

I'm broken. I was strong for her, but now it's like I dont have a reason to be strong anymore. I pretend like I'm fine most of the time. I have a real cocksure facade I'm always wearing. Always have. But now it's more of a facade than it has been since I was a kid. I smile and joke during the day, but at night I can't sleep until the sun comes up. I just lay there and can't get her out of my fucking head. 

Its been months now and I still don't know what the fuck to do. None of the insurance covered therapists in my area are taking new clients, and im at the point where I need to be talking to some kind of professional.

2020-01-09 10:29:25;PTSD and the VA;"So I've been diagnosed with PTSD for some things I did in Iraq. I didn't know what was wrong untill I started having panic attacks and blacked out at work. I thought it was a heart attack but apparently not. The VA rated me at 50% which is too low I think as I haven't been able to work because things have gotten so bad.

I went to the VA inpatient program for treatment twice now. It seems to help while I am hospitalized but not so much after I go back home. I have done everything they have recommended, pills, counseling, everything they requested. The last statement of the case they sent me says all that is available to base my request for increase is self reported statements. I know the doctors and psychiatrists at the VA inpatient hospital took notes as well as the psychiatrist and counselors I have been seeing for the past 6 years. 

Are they just hoping I will kill myself before they have to increase my disability. Honestly some days that seems like it would be easier than dealing with the VA anymore. 

I went to see an outside psychologist to get an actual written medical opinion since the VA doctors say they don't provide paperwork for disability purposes. The psychiatrist cost $600 and when I went for my results a week or so later she wanted to have me committed. I am not doing great but I am not bad enough to be hospitalized again yet. I have talked to my psychiatrist when things are so bad that I am running out of options which is how I ended up in the inpatient program the last two times.

I guess Huntsville, AL holds that name now. But, it didn't hold that name when I was on Romeo Ramp on Bagram.

I was on nightshift for the majority of the time. We'd laugh and cajole when the WAVES alarm went off a quarter mile away.  How shitty is it that these people sent rockets/mortars/artillery at us. At least it was someone I didn't know or relate to. And those were the times they didn't hit within 20 meters.

And that haunts me to this day. Every time we took IDF, I knew somebody HAD to be hit. They're inaccurate, but they're not NOT aiming either.

My proudest day was when we sent outgoing rockets.  I don't know if we killed anyone, but we definitely let them know how we felt.

If anyone has experience and any tips to help reverse his seclusion of his life from us please let me know.
A little bit of a back story, when he first was diagnosed with PTSD my dad had recently re-married and moved a couple hours east of the rest of the family so he wasn’t around as much and my mom had him move back into her house, I later moved out since I had graduated highschool and went to attend college a few states away, paying for my own education and bills I couldn’t afford to go home a lot.. my mom would always talk very negatively about my dad because she was upset about the divorce still (even tho she caused it and it had been 10 years but that’s another story) she also had a lot of resentment for my oldest sister and would talk negatively about her a lot which I’m not sure if this had some kind of brainwash affect on him at a very vulnerable state of his life, he had lived in my moms house for 5 years to recover from the PTSD which he still is working on but moved out to live with his wife a few months ago. I had a lot going on around this time making new friends, getting used to my new city, busy with school and I didn’t keep in as good of contact as I should’ve but I would text him every now and then or call and even send postcards which as of 7 months ago he’s stopped responding. He refuses to talk to my dad and it’s hard for him to talk to any of us siblings except my little brother and my mom. I can’t help but think my mom has talked him into not talking to us as much and to stop reaching out. All of us siblings have really fond memories growing up with him and it’s sad to see him not caring to try and keep a relationship and I know that this just has to be from his PTSD maybe. If anyone has experience dealing with this kind of similar situation please let me know what I can do to mend my family back together and have my brother start communicating with the family again.

I outprocessed from the Navy this past April and my mental state quickly deteriorated after that.

I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim’s and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won’t be.  The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.  There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away.

2019-06-26 12:24:26;Long, but a little of my story.;"I will start this simple, basically like a diary entry. You reading this don’t know who I am, and I want to keep it this way, however, I will introduce myself. I am a 23 year old Sergeant in the Marine Corps. I joined in 2014, went to boot camp in San Diego, and got stationed in Camp Pendleton. Currently I am still active duty, so animosity is extremely important to me for reasons that I will discuss later. This year (2018) I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. The letters rolling out of my mouth still feel weird to say. I knew for a while, and the shock and awe of the doctor sitting away from me and saying this wasn’t because I was surprised; it was because it was real now, I am now “that guy”.

So, my story... I deployed with a small detachment of Marines in 2016 to the Middle East, I worked on a lot of stuff that, as most reading this should understand, i can’t really put on a public page. But, with that being said, what I can say is that I’m a POG, with an MOS that’s not really entirely “POG” like, however my job involved a desk, and a computer, a set of headphones, and a lot (and I mean a lot) of paper, briefs, and video. The video is the key here, because for a very long time, I thought what was wrong with me was something else, I was half right, but I didn’t even see what else was happening inside my own head. 

Summer of 2016, Iraq (that’s about as vague as I’ll get with location), I’m sitting there after kicking a brief that didn’t really seem too “off the wall” at first, standard stuff. Well, the mission didn’t end up so standard, and a handful of people didn’t get to come back. This is one of the biggest issues I have, because this “it’s still classified” line keeps coming up, and I can’t really just throw it out there and talk. But long story short, it was my fault, and not a person on this earth can convince me otherwise.

But, I’m writing to talk about another issue I had, and to an extent, still do. The day that I broke down, almost a year after I got back, and completely lost everything because I couldn’t hold it in, the words to my best friend that followed we something like “please don’t tell anyone”. I was terrified of myself, I hated myself, but I was more terrified of my command finding out. 

I had this stigma that, if my command found out, I’d be looked at differently, I would be pulled from my billet, and I wouldn’t be able to do what I love. (Let’s make this clear, I love what I do, the Marines are my life, I do this for them, so yes I am that “motivator”) I was worried that my command would take me, make me unfit for duty, and send me on my way. I had this because, as a leader, I would have done that, to the extent of removing the Marine from his billet so that he “can focus on himself”.  I didn’t want anyone to know. 

For along time, my best friend was who I leaned on, I wouldn’t talk to anyone else, and no one found out. Until I PCS’d. I went from one coast to the other and all of a sudden I was alone. I had no one, no help, no one to go see. I was scared of myself again. And I stayed like this for almost 6 months, until all hell broke loose in my life. I completely snapped, I wanted to die again, I didn’t care about me or anyone else, and yet, I still got up and went to work, with absolutely no motivation, the guilt just weighed on me. Until, I walked into the naval hospital, because I didn’t care if I lost my career, I just knew I needed help.

2019-03-03 23:57:33;I’m not a veteran and have never served in the military and wonder if this is the right sub for me.;"I mostly consider my PTSD to be related to being brutally raped as a child. It was a kill or be killed situation so I killed him. 

A year later I suffered a TBI that left me brain damaged and fundamentally changed the way I process information. And I was in constant physical pain that limited my life more and more until I had a hard time simply moving most of the time. 

I started being diagnosed with more and more health issues that really came to a head at age 18. I had a stomach problem that slowest starved me near to death. My doctors accused me of all sorts of things anytime I showed up to the ER begging for help. I looked like a holocaust victim before my problem was taken seriously and only because my heart rate and BP were so close to failing I had to be shocked back into rhythm and given a blood transfusion through my jugular to counteract the malnutrition, dehydration, and get me blood volume up before my organs failed. 

At 19 I suffered a miscarriage and the doctor explained I was so scarred from an 8 year old rape that it was a miracle I conceived but I would never be able to carry a child to term. 

Perhaps a blessing in disguise considering at 22 I was officially diagnosed with a genetic illness. At age 23 that diagnosis is refined to the rarest, deadliest subtype of such illness. A pregnancy with this subtype is almost always fatal for mothers. Not to mention the risk of passing on the genes to the kid. This refinement in diagnosis occurred after I developed a pseudoaneurism that didn’t result in complete amputation of my left arm but  left it almost useless. They said they’d probably have to amputate but they saved it. 7 surgeries in 1 month and 45 days in the hospital combined with all the nerve damage and constant agony really made me wish they’d just amputated to begin with. 

I’m 24 and can barely move some days due to physical and psychological pain. It’s like I’m a traumatized soldier who can never escape the war zone because my enemy is my own body. And no amount of therapy can change the fact that with my illness, it’s all just downhill and deterioration until I die. 

My trauma wasn’t a single incident but dozens as I went from being a serious athlete and perfect student to someone who could hardly function. 

My experience with combat related trauma is in my genetic code. Just being born was a battle because of my genetic illness. And physically my first experience was killing in self defense at the age of 11. 

But the war against my body will never end until I die. Could be today. But it’ll almost certainly be over by  age 40 or 50. ";r/PTSDCombat;4;8;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/awv8oy/im_not_a_veteran_and_have_never_served_in_the/
2018-12-18 02:44:41;Questions about nightmares/flashbacks;"So, hey there reddit! Long story short I'm a civilian trained in rescue and first aid thanks to my hobby as a mountain climber. I live in Venezuela and during the last year protest, I participated as a member of a neutral party that provided first aids to everyone who needed, regardless of their politic orientation. However the military didn't like that we were helping the wounded protestor, so they took it on us too. 

&#x200B;

Trigger warning: Gun violence  


Stuff happened, and I almost got shot in the chest by a shotgun. After that, I developed a complex PTSD which I mostly ignored that I had until the symptoms were too obvious. Among those, I have almost daily dreams of me being in a combat situation, the kind of kill or be killed. In those dreams, it's not uncommon for me to get shoot, and its actually a constant the fact that I have to hurt other people to survive (if I get to survive, a decent part of those dreams ends with me dying). However, the dreams actually don't bother me that much. I never wake up anxious or depressed, it's mostly a feeling similar to ""wow that was intense, I should write it somewhere / make a drawing based on it"".  I do have trouble sleeping, and insomnia, I never attributed those to the dreams in specific. I tend to get the dreams when Im not taking medication for my sleep issues, but I also sleep better without the medication when I actually get 6+ sleep hours, regardless of how wild my dreams get. With the meds, it's more like fainting and waking up with a hangover, with hardly any dream.   


I'm new here to PTSD, as I got my formal diagnosis like two weeks ago.  If you guys don't mind, I would like to ask you guys a couple of questions:  


\*Do you have dreams/flashback related to the source of your PTDS? And how often? 

\*Are the dreams something that mess up with your sleep cycle? 

\*How do you cope with the dreams?

2018-07-21 02:28:59;Stuck in the shit.;"New here, so quick intro. I was diagnosed five years ago when I was living in Seattle. I was able to get help, and started getting my shit square. Moved to Atlanta four years ago. the VA here has been useless and groups are full of people riding a fad. 

Started going to AA meetings, which helped a lot (I was stupidly self medicating). Fast forward to now, I’ve got a little girl who is three and my marriage is been on the upswing for a while. Recently I’ve started feeling the old shit creeping in. Nightmares are back, so I’m not sleeping. Anxiety is at an all time high. 

Last night I went off on my daughter simply because she wouldn’t go to bed. I caught myself standing over a toddler yelling at her like I was a DI with a fresh boot. I immediately felt like shit, and I could see she was scared of her “mean daddy”.  She’s never seen me when the PTSD has me in the shit. 

Im not sure what my point is other than having some like minds to share this with. Thanks for letting me vent. ";r/PTSDCombat;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/90ihb8/stuck_in_the_shit/
2018-03-28 00:28:34;No sleep, for days.;"My husband who has ptsd, will goes days without sleeping, or maybe get a few hours here and there. When this happens he gets fixated on things and won’t sleep until he feels he solves it. 

Right now and the last time it happened, he is fixated on his ptsd and diagnosis, he feels he has a duel diagnosis and won’t be treated for it, he has been going on an on and on about it. He isn’t himself and doesn’t believe me. 

I get worried that like last night, he will end up back at the hospital with a psych stay. He went four days without sleep last time , and was also fixated on his treatment. He starts to have trouble talking, and thinking and will not out his phone down. 

I get worried and he tells me if he isn’t a harm to himself or others then there is nothing to worry about.

2018-02-18 20:29:28;I’m losing my husband;"My (F 27) husband (29)  was diagnosed with PTSD about 5-6 years ago. And we have been working with therapists since then to try and make him feel a little better. He has had so many bad days over the years, but just last week he hadn’t slept in four days. He was sounding delirious saying he doesn’t have the ptsd he is getting treated for and that’s why he isn’t feeling better . 

He says it’s complex ptsd and he needs a new therapist and new treatment, we spent 2 hours together in a new therapists office, he completely had a mental break down , an voluntarily emitted himself into the hospital ( which he changed his mind on and they almost took him involuntarily) he stayed one night. 

When I picked him up he said he felt the same way but it was more clear now. He said he feels in control of his emotions and wants to do this different. The only thing is, he isn’t even my husband anymore. He sound robotic and in a state of manic. He spends the whole day checking feelings, and asking our kids if what they did was ok . 

This all is great, he is helping more and more involved. But he has no personality anymore, and I cried my self to sleep because I miss him, how he was. I don’t want him to suffer, but I need some part of him back and he isn’t there.

2017-11-20 00:02:24;Really need some help about my bf’s combat PTSD. He pushes me away whenever things get serious.;"I’m 28 and he’s 33. I’m a civilian and he served multiple tours in Afghanistan (Paratrooper 173rd). Just to clear things up right away: we’re both guys. 

We met about 2.5 years ago. When we first met, we got to know each other and then ended up in a relationship for about 6 months until one day he ends it out of the blue. A week before he broke up with me, he gave me his dog tags, the ones he wore Down Range, and said “I’m not sure what I’m trying to say here but I’ve been wanting to give these to someone who has proved themselves to me...so I think I’m falling in love with you.” I was over the moon, confused as all hell because this was the first same sex relationship I was in and for my guy as well. 

Apparently the night he gave me his tags, I left to head home, he had a panic attack about “us” that was so severe he thought he was having a heart attack and almost went to the ER. Then a week goes by and says that he can’t do this anymore and how I deserve better. 

After the break up, over the next 2.5 years (to current) it would go like this...we would reconnect, be only platonic, have unspoken feelings of course, be best friends, things start feeling like the idea of “us” is happening, and then he pushes me away. He will totally cut me out of his life. Try to say things to make me never come back to him. Months will go by and somehow we reconnect. And the same thing happens. It should be noted: My guy was able to talk to me about his PTSD and about his tours Down Range. He established a deep trust with me and was able to tell me about his “darkness” and what he did. 

Most recently (Sept to Nov) we really reconnected again, both of us really evolved and his issues/PTSD were “under control” and truly did improve. We communicated great, expressed our concerns, and had no agenda of “us.” Well of course underlying emotions kick in and the love that was once there still is active. So as things started to fall back into place again...he runs. Total cut off again, called me crazy for thinking anything was happening between us and denied having any “love” feelings towards me. Told me we will never speak again and we will never see each other ever again. I should note that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (third time again)  due to Gulf War syndrome and has told me “I want to move away and die so that you don’t have to deal with this cancer and me.” So I know this has played into everything now too. Also another time he pushed me away is when his cancer returned for the second time, odd. 

I’m curious if anyone has experienced a similar pattern of behavior within their relationship with their soldier. Even on a best friend level, he will push away. I know the cancer scare is pushing him and I see the pattern and the poor behavior. 

I know our paths will cross again in some way but I can’t hold onto that, I know this. Even if we don’t end up in a relationship, I want him in my life in some way. Our journey was amazing and I feel that it’s not over. 

Has anyone had their soldier do this to them? Cuts you off and then after months go by in some way they come back, things get better, and then they ghost.

2017-08-13 04:00:28;You're not in the forces now;"Combat Stress is the UK's leading veterans' mental health charity. We treat a range of mental health conditions including PTSD, depression and anxiety.

Ok so I have been at Combat Stress for nearly 1 week now and will be staying for another week before the completion of this initial course. 

This place and its staff are absolutely amazing!! and it really does amaze me how this is a charity Cliff Bush and NOT instead funded by the UK Government? Lets face it, everyone who has been, and will come through the doors have served their country and whilst serving have come face to face with life threatening danger that has caused mental health issues that will have changed their lives. Some here have lost their marriages, lost their jobs and one has even been so forgotten about that he's now living in an old peoples home!!!! OMG he's lost some of the best years of his life and ONLY NOW is he getting the help and support he should have had when leaving service... it really does sadden me :-(( 

What is great, is that everyone here has taken the brave step to admit that they have an issue but more importantly 'They want to get it sorted'

Combat related PTSD is a very dangerous and much mis-understood diagnosis but these guys (staff) are so finely tuned to look and listen to the secret language you speak that it really is amazing what they do.

Here at Audley Court, Telford, they give you, FREE of charge, every possible resource to gain the tools in bringing the PTSD under control instead of it controlling you. 

They give accommodation with en-suite facilities, meeting rooms to speak and learn coping strategies, 3 fully cooked meals a day with supper served on a trolly at 2100!! They have whats called the OT room where every resource you could ever want to engage in art, drawing, painting, playing piano, banging drums, playing a guitar, doing pottery, building large model aircraft (picture coming soon), feeding the 2 pet turtles, or just watching fish swim round in a large tank, they supply wellness councillors, psychotherapists, a doctor & nurse, staff that clean, staff that are on hand 24/7 to help and guide you with whatever you want. 

Basically if they haven't got what you need then they will go out and get it for you! 

And when you consider that, as far as i've been told, they get just £300 per day per person to provide all that then I think it really disgusting that we aren't, as a country,  supporting Combat Stress with more financial assistance. When guys or girls come down for longer 6 weeks, more intensive programs, CS apply to their local NHS to fund their admission but on occasions the NHS have refused and so that veteran would be left totally vulnerable if CS was to then refuse them.

I'm here for the basic 2 week initiation to understand just what happens with combat PTSD and it's amazing. We watched a video Friday afternoon, learning all about PTSD and what it does to people. I can say that there were 4 people in my group and by the end, no-one had dry eyes, me included.

It all made sense and everything just came together in a 'AHHHH moment, and thats what got everyone. Yes the guy speaking was talking about what he went through BUT for everyone, no matter what conflict you served on, when it happened, it ALL rings true.

IF you know anyone living with PTSD or may think they have PTSD or If you want to look inside their head and understand just what is going on then I really do suggest that you sit down with everyone and watch this brilliant video.

Personally, and I have 2 copies on DVD, I will be giving it to my GP and healthcare professionals to give them awareness of what goes on inside someones head and I suggest you do the same if you want someone to understand.

I have posted this video on my YouTube channel, just look at some of the comments to this (picture posted)...

2017-05-23 03:37:34;Can't stop ruminating over a flashback of Iraq that occurred in public (long story) (x-post r/ptsd);"I was in the Army, deployed to Iraq, haven't gotten diagnosed with PTSD (seeing a psych this summer) but I show symptoms. Can't go into a room or building without scanning it, tend to isolate myself because I just can't relate to people as well as I used to, crushing depression that I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, difficulty creating relationships, etc. I am in grad school right now, so it certainly has been a challenge for me to juggle things (and perhaps some survivors guilt) but I manage.

Until I had my first flashback.

It was a small group, a door slammed loudly outside, everyone was scared, but I was fucking startled. Like, arms crossed in front of face with knees up as a defense posture-scared. The sound came from behind me (why I feel better if there's a wall behind me), I was so desperate to hear what that sound was, I didn't even want my breathing to interfere. I wanted to hear for a second one, but I was horrified that it would confirm my fear. I sat there, eyes wide open, mouth dropped, holding my breath, head pulsing from my heart pumping blood. All I saw was desert sand in front of me.

I had whole conversations in my head, it wasn't like I was just temporarily dead. I was frozen in fear thinking it was a gun, I screamed in my head for someone, anyone with a higher rank to tell me what to do. My eyes darted to the left, at my teacher at her desk, my head shivered and tilted in her direction, it wasn't a normal smooth turn of my neck. Her eyes were huge, she was watching all of this happen. She asked if I wanted to open the door and see what it was, but I just stared at her, half of me understanding but the other half saw her in a military uniform, giving me an order. So I just stared at her. She looked away.

Don't ask me how, but I turned to face the door, rushed to open it thinking ""If I die, I die now"", I turned the knob and I was absolutely angry to see the professor, behind his door peeking to see if he scared anyone. I turned around in my seat, facing forward, eyes wide, mouth open, not breathing, frozen in anger, not believing that it was a fucking door. I reached for some chocolate nearby and shoved it in my mouth as a way to ground myself. My professor calls out to the other, joking that he scared her students, she proceeds to have a conversation with him.

What follows fear? Anger. I sat there, turning my eyes in the direction of his voice. Until then, I had never had homicidal thoughts. I wanted to kill that man, I thought he was going to kill me. At the time, half of me didn't get why I was looking towards his voice, nor why I was methodically licking the four corners of our sharp teeth, and forcefully clenching my jaw. I wanted to kill him so bad, I imagine I looked like a rabid animal. I just sat there, clenching my jaws, hearing their conversation but not really listening. She asked him what his plans were, just kinda talking with him, he told a joke. A funny alcoholic joke. I sat there, stopped clenching my jaw, thought about what he said, and I just laughed. It was a deep guffaw, he completely turned my emotions from anger to laughter. I remember having the biggest grin on my face, staring at his back, not believing he told a clever alcoholic joke, I just stared at him with the widest grin in my life, until I snapped back to reality.

See, this whole time, I thought this was all in my head or at the very least I was quiet enough that no one noticed. Even me turning to my teacher, it was as if I just dreamed the whole thing. I reached for my ipad, literally pretending to scroll through reddit, while I zoned out and proceeded to catch myself, twice, before remembering that he was still in the room.

That joke was so funny, I just smiled at his back, telling myself how clever he is and how funny it was, until the thoughts changed to ""I would've killed that man"". My smile faded and I just sat there, staring at his head, thinking about how he should be punished for not realizing what a loud door did to me. How I thought I was going to die. It wasn't his fault, he probably had a family, I would get kicked out of school, but still...I would've killed that man.

My professors finished their conversation, I rushed to face the ipad to fake that I was scrolling reddit, but as he walked behind me towards the door, I quickly turned to my left and right to check my back just to make sure he wouldn't attack me.

I just sat there, completely zoned out. I didn't look or talk to anyone, they were just figures in the room, living their lives, completely unaware of what happened to me because I thought no one noticed. Awkwardly enough, the class just continued. I zoned out for minutes at a time, wondering what the fuck just happened and why it happened after all these years. I looked down, my shirt was untucked. I didn't understand this, why was my shirt untucked? I dreamed that whole thing, I was so quiet. I just laughed to myself, tucked it in, then zoned out again.

I looked up, worried that a classmate would think I was staring at his crotch, and that's when I saw them. Staring at me. It's been probably a couple minutes of me just zoning out, but they were just staring at me. Obviously I was horrified, I couldn't help but turn red and my legs were shaking. It took a while, but I controlled it, although I was still beet red.

Class ended and I left immediately. I have spoken to only one of my classmates about it but he seemed awkward. Made it seem like he totally forgot and he had to kinda make some of it up. He told me it lasted 10 seconds, and all that happened is that I was a little more scared than everyone else. Since then, I think about it every day, but I am working on it. I'm trying to get and stay sober, gonna see a psychiatrist, I'm still passing my classes, and I hope to graduate soon, but still have trouble with relationships. I just need to be normal again, or get closer to it.

I want to have friends, I want to go months without drugs or alcohol, I want to have a good relationship and be a good partner, maybe even a family one day! Fuck, seeing so many people get married and have kids by now just feels so impossible! How do people do this shit? I just need to figure this shit out right now. I'm seeing a psychiatrist this summer.

If you've made it this far, thank you. If you have any tips you'd like to share on recovery, please do. I know that none of us deserve to suffer every fucking day like this, trying to be normal, but not quite being there. I know it's possible, I just haven't figured out how yet.

2017-05-09 19:14:03;MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) could really be Bipolar. Or, a short story on how I was (most likely) misdiagnosed and given the wrong medication for years, making me worse.;"This is more of a direction disability question for anyone out there in a similar situation.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) back in 2012, with it spanning back to my first deployment in 2006.

I have been on medication several times, but it seems like every medication only made me worse. To the point that my psychiatrist has taken me off all my meds twice (and I have done this on my own about 3 times) due to horrible side effects and sliding deeper into depression.

I really got fed up and went through my VA records to see the issue. It appears that all my symptoms are in line with Bipolar Disorder, which seems to be commonly misdiagnosed as MDD. One of the hallmarks is being made worse with anti-depression and (for you nerve pain patients out there) gabapentin.

This isn't a diagnosis for you, nor something to improve your ratings. This is for the quality of life because it seems certain that I have been misdiagnosed and no one has caught it yet. Hopefully, if someone is out there going through the same things maybe my story can help them out. If you think you might be in the same situation, I ask that you check out Bipolar disorder because it seems to be really misunderstood and we suffer for that.

I am in the middle of moving and trying to get on the meds for bipolar to see if they help, I will try and update the community.

2015-12-22 04:52:07;A question for those with psychosis;"Hi all,

Non-veteran here, PTSD (not yet officially diagnosed, due to see a clinical psychologist), and possibly some light psychosis, psychiatrist has only given a dx of psychosis due to her not believing the event happened. I'm currently in two minds about her diagnosis of current psychosis, while it may very well be true, it's hard to distinguish from the PTSD symptoms (which are clear, but seem to have been totally ignored by her).

I guess the reason for asking here is it's a more closely related set of experiences in here in comparison to r/PTSD, which I feel may make it easier to distinguish the difference.

My question is, how do *you* distinguish between the PTSD symptoms and the psychosis? Is there anything in particular that stands out, particularly on the delusion spectrum? The event was fairly recent for me, and while I'm not using Reddit as a substitute for medical advice, I do feel the need to make sense of it all in my head.

I know it's a difficult question to answer, like how to explain PTSD to someone, but if anyone has any insight, it'd be really helpful to hear :)";r/PTSDCombat;3;8;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/3xqylb/a_question_for_those_with_psychosis/

I was initially diagnosed with an adjustment disorder but after a series of unfortunate events I've now been diagnosed with PTSD in the last few weeks... 

*>be britbong in Sangin, Afghanistan     
*>chilling watching the sunrise over the compound walls.   
*>hear massive bang and a tortured metal sound.   
*>ohshit.wav.   
*>ICAT helicopter has taken an RPG to the tail.   
*>explosive crump as it hits the ground about 700m away.   
*>crash out the gate, arrive there 5 minutes after its hit.   
*>has crashed across 2 compounds. Smoke, debris everywhere.    
*>kick in door to compound where the fuselage has gone in.   
*>fuck it all IEDs would have detonated when it crashed and it looked like an occupied compound     
*>raging inferno.   
*>have to back out of compound, go into the one where the remainder of the tail and some of the load has gone into.   
*>not as fucked up, pretty clear although the dividing wall is down.   
*>find male kid, about 12, in the corner, blood and burned flesh drag marks from the gap in the wall to his position.    
*>burns over his entire body, ears, nose and eyes gone.     
*>start treating him, Stabilise airways, get fluids into him.     
*>gets evacuated eventually, still alive when he goes on the PEDRO   
*>spend the rest of the day pulling bodies out the rekt compound     
*>at least 5 crew, 2 kids and a few adults.   
*>get back to my compound, did some good, feels good brah.   
*>mfw that kid died probably while we were putting what's left of his little sister in a parachute because we ran out of body bags.    

Suppose I'm sharing because it's never good to keep shit bottled up.  ";r/PTSDCombat;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/PTSDCombat/comments/3odu93/sharing_is_caring/
