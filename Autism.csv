2025-11-08 22:50:57;Do you often think about thinking?;"Metacognition is something that comes up a lot when I chat to other people. They mention it about me. Especially that I think about my thought patterns, question established frameworks (multi domain and multimodal). 

But being a late diagnosed person makes me reflect on my experiences and assumptions. It makes me challenge assumptions about other people, myself, socializing, culture, economics, philosophical implications, gender etc. It’s just goes on and on. 

Do you do this? Do people mention it about you? I sort of zoom out until I’m like “well, we are just dust.” And I sit with the absurdity of existence. 

I think I’m wondering if this is a common experience, particularly for late identified/suspecting folks. But to be frank. I’ve always done this. It’s the only way I’ve ever known. ";;;;
2025-11-08 22:50:42;How to live alone? Hi everyone, I'm new here on the sub.;"How to live alone? Hi everyone, I'm new here on the sub. I was diagnosed with autism in childhood, but by my parents' choice I never received treatment. In fact, throughout my life they hid it from me and were going to ""cure"" me through punishment, I think many here have gone through this. Well, currently I no longer have family and it has been a very difficult life. Recently I managed to see a psychiatrist and psychologist, and I was diagnosed with autism again, that's when I understood what was happening in my childhood. But now, what to do? I honestly don't know, I'm completely alone and hardly ever leave the house, I can't afford treatment and this is destroying me. I'm a visual artist, but in recent months I've had many, many crises and I can't take it anymore, even suicide seems like an option for me, because I can't see a future. Does anyone else have a similar life? How to continue like this?";;;;
2025-11-08 22:45:49;lost on my way to get diagnosed;"hi guys ! I'm new on here, English is not my first langage and I'm a bit confused so it's not organized at all I'm sorry in advance...

So my new therapist thinks that I'm on the spectrum and I'm starting the procedure to get diagnosed but it's complicated since I don't have a psychiatrist anymore and there is a waiting list (and I also think it's expensive to get tested but I'm not sure of that)

I was followed by therapist and all since I was a child because of family issues and a violent lost. 
So I have ptsd, I had a severe depression 4 years ago (it's getting better but it's a long way) and I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder so with all of that professionals never talked about autism till now (and I'm thinking if I was they should have seen it no ? but I read that it's often diagnosed late for women)

I started to study psychology and everything that I read about autism kinda related to me A LOT and many people told me that I have ""autistic behavior"" (maybe it's weird to say that ? I don't know ? but it wasn't on a mean way or anything just an observation) 
I'm still learning about autism since it's very new to me and we have a lot of misinformation but it would explain so many things in my life and in myself 
I am a bit scared of the diagnostic it would definitely relieve me a lot because explaining why I am like I am and everything but at the same time I feel like it's a big change and I am also scared of my family's reactions... (not my mother tho she is amazing with me)

so I have a lot of questions and I am in a big need of advices (everything is welcomed) : 

- good books or articles on autism spectrum
- any advices to improve your daily life
- is depression linked in a way to autism or late diagnosis
- how to not be overstimulated in everyday life and how to deal with tiredness 
- advices for university 
- objects that can help
- how to shut down your brain sometimes 
- what did the diagnosis change for you 

and everything you think is important for me to know ! 

thank you so much for reading !! I'm really sorry it's messy but it's like my mind right know...
Thank you in advance for any answers <3

2025-11-08 22:11:33;Struggling to accept my diagnosis to a point I'm regretting it - did anyone else feel this way?;PLEASE tell me someone else has felt like this, that I’m not completely alone in it. I’ve been searching everywhere, but all I ever seem to find are stories of people feeling relief, validation, and peace with their diagnosis. I don’t feel any of that. All I feel is shock and confusion, because I was so sure I wasn’t autistic. How long did it take for others to come to terms with it? To finally feel like themselves again, not just a diagnosis? How do you accept the help that’s offered without feeling guilty, like you’re taking advantage of something you never even wanted in the first place?;;;;
2025-11-08 21:54:49;I’m struggling to except that i might never fully be able to live by myself with major support;"(edit: i misspelled the caption, i meant without major support, that’s adhd for ya)


My entire life i’ve always thought that once i got older i’d move out and get my own place like everyone else. My oldest sister (who isn’t autistic) moved out when she was fairly young so i just assumed i would do the same. When i got diagnosed with autism and adhd i didn’t think about how that would impact my adult life. 

I’ve gotten to the age where you are supposed to already know what you want to do with your life, and i know what i want it just might not be possible. I had a talk with my mom about living on my own, and she really made me realize how much she actually does for me so i can go to school and not constantly be burnt out. And it also just made me realize that if i were to move out i would have to do all of that and it scares me. We talked about what options there are for assisted living and it also just seems scary. I never thought i’d need it and in some way i’ve always thought i was ‘better’ than those people that need it, which is stupid but i so badly want to be normal. 

The idea of having to live in an assisted living facility scares me because it means i’d have to admit that i need that much help, and i’ll never be able to live a normal life and buy a house or apartment with a partner because they shouldn’t have to be responsible for taking care of all my needs along with their own. I’m struggling to cope with it all, so any advice for anyone who’s gone through something similar would be very greatly appreciated. I’m looking for that light at the end of the tunnel but i can’t see it.";;;;
2025-11-08 21:54:31;The trans = autism debate;"After finally getting diagnosed, I feel my family are using it as an excuse to prove why I'm not a man. And I think it's why my mother pushed for me to get it in the first place.

My mother used to support me but after the 'looming' idea of hormones and surgeries she backed out, thinking I would ruin my body - projecting her childhood insecurities onto me.
Because of the limited research, many bigots are using autism as the reason why 'everyone is trans'. When (atleast in my own experience as I can't speak for other people) I exhibit more typically male traits of autism, despite being born female.

I've always had the idea that I was male, only having the courage to figure out and explain it at 11. Now I'm 18, and been male in the eyes of friends, family, and society for a while.
The only 'female' traits I seem to have is high masking, but I was always horrible at it, able to push down my feelings/meltdowns but not able to hide the obvious traits like stimming, or being a kid prodigy. (Which when you think about it, is a more commonly male way of dealing with feelings in general)

It sucks that even after being diagnosed, my relationships continues to get worse. My family keeps losing respect for me because of aspects of myself that I can't change.

I couldn't even hide being a man if I wanted to - i tried to do that for the first several years of my life. I like classically manly stuff, boys TV shows, playing zombie shooters, the colours blue and green, racing games, etc.

And somehow, all of my experiences of being a boy in a girl's body and so much more have been boiled down to ""it's just autism"" after the diagnosis. When I could list countless experiences as a kid, all the way to adulthood, that had nothing to do with it.

I find it frustrating how people weaponise minorities to hurt other minorities to ultimately keep anyone who isn't neurotypical, white, cis, straight, rich, etc into small boxes they can't escape from to keep the 1% in power.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.";;;;
2025-11-08 21:32:34;What are you like, those of you with comorbid ADHD?;"I'm autistic, and that's always been clear. My first diagnosis was at age two, even before I learned to speak.

The thing is, I've often been told I might also have ADHD. Many friends have said so, and I recently found a school report recommending my parents have me evaluated for ADHD. I recently went to a psychiatrist, and she told me I have several symptoms, but not severe enough to warrant medication, and that if I need help at any point, I should contact her again. I found that answer very vague.

I've researched people with ADHD, but I don't identify with them, although I don't identify with autistic people either. 
What are you like, those of you with AuDHD?";;;;
2025-11-08 21:22:58;I can't tell if I'm neurodivergent I think I'm more socially awkward if anything;"So I (23 F) can't really tell if I actually have adhd (I kind of wanna get reevaluated just to make sure because when I was in the psych ward I was only there for a week and I mentioned once that I think I might have ADHD and they just agreed and that's not really how you go about diagnosing ADHD lol) and I don't really believe that I could be autistic I think I'm more socially awkward if anything. I feel like I'm more likely to be neurotypical with neurodivergent tendencies because I do get along more with people who just so happen to be neurodivergent.

A list of things that I do to get a better picture

• I have a hard time making eye contact with people I don't know on a personal level.

• I don't like making small talk I don't get it. I don't understand how people can just talk about mundane things like the weather. I don't I'm really get how people can just start talking to people without having a common interest to begin with. And when I do attempt to do small talk it just feels really weird and I don't really know how to continue the conversation and I just feel awkward.

• I find it easier to talk to kids then I do adults that I don't know personally.

• If I do get the opportunity to talk about something that I know a lot about or that I'm interested in I find it way easier to talk to people that way.

• I tend to be more sociable when I'm high on weed. It takes away so much anxiety and I'm able to just be able to jump into conversations with just about anybody. Things just flow more naturally for me that way because I feel a lot more confident and I'm not overthinking things.

• I understand sarcasm and I do it myself though depending on what it is I can take some things literally I can't really think of any examples at the moment though.

• I do over explain things and repeat myself a lot because I don't want people to misunderstand me and I just really want to make my point clear just so there's no misunderstanding and for people to just get what I mean.

• I can't tell if it's inattentive ADHD or if I'm just lazy. I think I'm just lazy because there are some things I don't want to do just because I simply don't want to do them because I just find them incredibly tedious. That can include cooking for myself sometimes because I find the steps of cooking to be extremely tedious and just ugh like even thinking about it it's like I just don't want to I just want to have the food there immediately without me having to do any of the steps I like instant gratification.

• Once I start something and if I'm interrupted doing that certain thing I have a hard time getting the motivation to go back and continue doing it.

• I can get both overwhelmed and overstimulated. Overwhelmed because I'm thinking about all the things I have to do and overstimulated because it feels like I can hear everything at once when things get too loud. I work with kids and sometimes I can be very overstimulating for me when I'm having multiple kids Vine for my attention and they can get incredibly loud and they tend to talk over each other and then it feels like I end up hyper focusing on all the noise going around me and it just feels like I'm about to go crazy.

• I don't like the sun I don't know how to explain it but the sun just feels incredibly loud and just really obnoxious I don't like it.

• I've gotten hyperfixated on things but I believe you can get hyper fixated on things without having ADHD or Autism.

• I know a lot about things like anime, and horror related things and comics. I really like Spider-Man for what he represents and I find the popular rise of Demon Slayer so fascinating. 

• I collect manga and I'm very particular of how I take care of them. And if I am collecting anything else, if that particular thing comes in a set I have to get the entire set otherwise it doesn't feel right.

• Sometimes I just don't register doing certain things for example having to check the mail daily it just doesn't cross my mind to do that. And I constantly forget where I've placed things like my phone or my keys. 

• I can get distracted for example I'll go out of my way to try and clean my room but then I end up on my bedroom floor painting my clear phone case with nail polish because I don't like the fact that it's yellowing or when I go looking for a particular notebook to write something in I try to find a notebook that will fit the vibe of what I'm trying to particularly write or take notes in and I end up just going through every notebook that I've ever had to see if I've written anything in them. 

• I prefer that people tell me their boundaries right away because I don't want to be doing something that ends up making them uncomfortable because I'd just feel bad and admittedly I do find it kind of frustrating when people wait a really long time to tell me that I'm doing something that makes them uncomfortable because it just makes me feel like a horrible person and that all the good I've ever done as a person doesn't count anymore. 

• I do procrastinate a lot. 

• I do have the tendency to interrupt people in conversation but not because I'm trying to be rude it's just a person will say something and it'll trigger another topic and I can jump from topic to topic in conversation.

• The reason I think I might be more lazy is because I know I need to do certain things and I know the consequences if I don't do those certain things but that still doesn't give me enough motivation to do those things even if those things would be beneficial in the long run. So essentially I have a hard time finding motivation to do things. 

• If I'm not hyperfixating on something things just feel incredibly boring. It feels like I don't really have anything to look forward to. 

• I keep to myself a lot in environments I'm not familiar with and it takes me a really long time to get comfortable with things. I consider myself to be extremely shy. 

• I can have a hard time with empathy sometimes. Like I do feel bad when it comes to tragedies but when it comes to people I'm not particularly close with I just don't seem to really care. Or more like I just don't really give it much thought I just continue going about my day. 

• I'm pretty sure there's more but this is long enough and I will mention that I am diagnosed with BPD and in therapy and on medication for it. My mood stabilizer is Lamotrigine and I am also on Wellbutrin. 

Idk I wanna know others opinions. ";;;;
2025-11-08 20:36:11;I'm so tired of people dismissing my ADHD and ASD;"No-one seems to understand neurodivergence and make it seem like I'm brainwashed by some sensationalised ideology.

I was diagnosed recently in my early 30s so have been masking well for at least half my life. Maybe they see that side of me and don't understand that I can barely function and I'm stressed/overstimulated most of the time.

My girlfriend understands because she has an invisible illness (EDS) that no-one (aside from me) understands. My mum tries to understand me which I admire. But my sisters, my dad, and my friends dismissed my neurodivergence completely and occasionally add comments that they don't realise are upsetting to me.

I feel so lonely regarding my recent neurodivergence journey. It started off great because I could finally explain why I struggle with things and my life started improving, especially since ADHD meds. But it's so disappointing having no-one understand you and so upsetting having people dismiss or refute your issues. They make me feel like I'm being viewed as delusional or brainwashed.

I'm sure a lot of you have had similar experiences and I guess I just needed to vent and look for some likemindedness.

Hopefully one day, it will be commonplace for people to validate our struggles";;;;
2025-11-08 20:11:58;UK-based question: Has anyone used The Autism Service? Are they trustworthy?;"I've been waiting since 2020 for a diagnosis through the NHS. It's still being processed but I'm thinking about expediting things by going private.

I am leery of paying for anything upfront without knowing much about the company.

Has anyone used these guys? Should I trust them or look elsewhere?

**EDIT** to clarify: I'm not asking for any rule-breaking info, just whether anyone has personal experience with this organisation and whether they provided the promised service. It ain't cheap and I'm fully aware that I'm very gullible at times.";;;;
2025-11-08 17:27:42;ADHD, realize most of my friends are most likely Autistic. Why do ADHD and Autistic people form connections so often?;"Sup. Sorry if this post is offensive, please let me know if i say anything ignorant.

So a couple months back i was diagnosed with ADHD. This sent me down the rabbithole about neurodevelopmental conditions and neurodivergence, including Autism.

I can now identify 2 of my IRL friends (out of the 3) are most likely Autistic. It was always sort of an open secret but we never had a label for it (Autism and ADHD, especially Autism, still are very stigmatized in my country) and i just didn't think about it much, you know.

I like my friends because they don't play social games like other people. Like, actually never it feels? I know that's not universal but that's been my experience. I (ADHD) can play social games but i find it annoying and i always have since i was like 5. I dislike unspoken rules and rules that are just there because somebody told me they did, without explaining why the rules are important and without me agreeing. 

They're very honest, and we don't judge eachother for being very passionate about our hobbies or info dumping. We're also all very honest with eachother i think, never had any issues with lying even about small things.

I do feel bad for them as they are often made fun of by other people for not understanding certain social cues. One of them, my best friend, has a thick skin. The other friend is constantly afraid and makes every tiny thing a secret because he's afraid the students in his class would make fun of him for those things. Things that aren't even embarrasing btw.

Anyway, i hear that ADHD and Autistic friendships are fairly common. Even relationships. What do you think causes that?

Me personally, i can say i like the honesty, passion, and predictability/reliability of my friends. Being friends with them helped me accept myself and work through my social anxiety.";;;;
2025-11-08 17:15:44;Therapist sent assessment report yesterday…;"(F25) This isn’t really a shock to me since I’ve suspected this since 2018, but was more focused on my social anxiety disorder and depression. This diagnosis makes sense and explains a lot about how I act and feel about things.

I would like this to be the last diagnosis for me related to mental health; I’m tired of collecting disorders like Pokémon 🙃";;;;
2025-11-08 16:57:04;bipolar and/or autism;"Feeling a bit lost lately so i'm coming here in case anyone would wanna share some opinion. 
I got diagnosed with autism when i was 18 and i definitely find it fitting to how i feel and live. 
Aside of that, i've had bad anxiety and depression for what feels like most of my life. Beginner of this year, i had a really rough time and got prescribed an antidepressant and xanax and i suddenly was GREAT, so energetic and motivated and productive and very social - but also having sensory and visual hallucinations. My psychiatrist took me off my AD after a month bc he said i never should've been out on them given my family history (loooots of mood issues/disorders). Rn i am feeling really down tbh and back where i was before. I have an appointement in january bc they think i might be bipolar (1 or 2 idk). 
Is there anyone out here who's both autistic and bipolar? i don't know if that's even possible to have both. Honestly i just feel lost. I'm open to any comment. 

PS English isn't my native language, sorry for the mistakes!";;;;
2025-11-08 16:26:42;Autism & Existentialism??;"I have ASD, maybe described as level 1, and I have been consumed with many existential questions from childhood, mostly the purpose and meaning of life and isolation. I also tend to think of death as a comfort rather than anything bad. I’m studying psychology at university and I am thinking of investigating the link between autism and existentialism. My research wouldn’t start till next year, but I kind of want to get a sense of how prevalent this is. 

Anyone here (either self-diagnosed or formal) experience existentialism, and what themes would you say are most likely for yourself?";;;;
2025-11-08 16:20:45;I am mildly autistic (diagnosed), want to have sex/a girlfriend, but seem to have absolutely no chance.;"DISCLAIMER: I'm going to mention sexual acts with a bit of detail in this post. Nothing strange or extreme, in fact quite normal and mild, but I will mark it as NSFW.

What I want to say in this post has layers, so I'll go step by step. The first, important thing I want to say is that right now, and for the past two years, I've been getting professional help, with a psychologist and a psychiatrist. My psychologist is a specialist in adult autism, and when he evaluated me, he said that the tests gave an ambiguous or borderline result. He told me that in such cases, it was up to the professional's decision whether or not the patient qualifies as autistic. He said he was willing to start treatment with me as an autistic patient, as the treatment I was getting before (a psychologist and a psychiatrist, both psychoanalysts who denied me the diagnosis) had failed to identify my severe depression, which was the greatest danger. In these two years, my depression has improved a lot, and I have learned a lot about myself as an autistic person, but I still have the problem stated in the post's title.

In summary: I watch porn every day, even if sertraline decreases my sexual desire and pleasure. I have a deep longing to consummate the sexual act with someone, but the physical aspect alone is not enough for me. One could say I am somewhat demisexual; I couldn't be with someone with whom I don't have an emotional and mental connection, although I would be lying if I said I'm not physically attracted.
I didn't have my first kiss until university. In high school, I didn't have any kind of sex-affective contact.

I had two girlfriends. One at 19, around 2016, who was my first kiss. It lasted six months, and we had intense kissing and fondling; we had some mild sexual activity, no penetration. Nothing more. After that, two and a half years passed.

During that time, I had a crisis where intrusive thoughts became so strong that I would break down crying. Suddenly, an idea would appear in the center of my consciousness that I can't describe better than ""you're a loser, and that's why you don't f*ck, you'll never f*ck because you're a loser and losers don't f*ck, and wanting anything different should make you very ashamed."" At one point, I was riding my bike and had to stop at a corner, leave my bike, and cry for a while to be able to continue. Generally, however, it was triggered by seeing nudity in series or movies, or hearing songs about seduction or sexuality, etc. All things that felt absolutely foreign to me and generated feelings of powerlessness and envy. That subsided over time, but those triggers are still there and still affect me.

I met another girl with whom we had chemistry, and we started dating soon after, in August 2019. At that time, we already knew she was going abroad for a six-month exchange to Germany. I visited her in February 2020 for 15 days; it was a beautiful experience, but I think at that point, she had already decided she was going to break up with me when she came back. Well, I had my real first time with her there in Germany. We f*cked. Three times, and then she got a urinary tract infection, and we didn't do it anymore. As I said, I returned to Argentina, she returned in March, she broke up with me (I don't hold a grudge), and the pandemic started, so I couldn't see her again.

Fast forward to 2022, my best friend, who was still friends with her, told me they had been talking and wanted to start dating. I told him it was no problem (a lie, but well, what was I going to say?). I tried to maintain the friendship, but I couldn't. I still haven't gotten over the trauma; sometimes, I have intrusive thoughts of the two of them f*cking.

All this happened in university, which was the time when I developed all the social skills that, as an undiagnosed, almost-autistic teenager, I lacked. I consider myself, at this moment, a sociable, extroverted person, even if socially clumsy sometimes. I have friends; I love my friends; they are basically that meme that is a Venn diagram where the circles say ""neurodivergents,"" ""otakus and geeks,"" and ""queer people,"" and where the three coincide, it says ""my friends."" They, unlike me, all have a (very) active sex life. In fact, at first, they talked about sex so much all the time that I had to ask them to please do it less because it triggers me a lot. Nevertheless, I love them. We see each other every week to play Dungeons and Dragons, which is how I met them, around 2021. Also, I share separate literature groups with two of them; I really like to write. My two passions are writing and reading, both literature and philosophy (my career, for which I plan to start a doctorate and which I also teach in a high school).

What I'm getting at: I have short, medium, and long-term projects; I have interests, but none of them lead me to have a partner and/or sex. I. Want. To. Have. Sex. And a girlfriend. But I have no idea how to do it. I'm not anti-social, but I really appreciate having time for myself, to read and write, and I generally always see the same people.
So, well, I don't know, I don't know what I should do. I've been talking about it a lot with my current psychologist, whom I appreciate very much, but I still haven't had any answer about this. I've talked to my friends, but no one knows what to tell me. Sometimes I reply to stories on Instagram from girls I like; I've invited some out, but I haven't gotten anything. I've been using OkCupid for two years, and I've never even gotten a date.

Anyway, I don't know what else to say. I included all the information that seemed relevant to me. I want to fall in love, I want to have sex with a girl I like, but I don't know how. Is it really too much to ask? I don't understand what's happening to me, or what I'm doing wrong.";;;;
2025-11-08 16:00:27;Can I ask what the cuddly toy thing is about?;"Hi I feel like I'm completely out of the loop with this, I see a lot of people post pictures of themselves on this sub and a lot of them seem to show a picture of them holding a plushie of some kind and some even feature it as the main reason for their post but there's never really any context, I also see a lot of people walking around in public carrying cuddly toys. 

The people I see doing this all look pretty young but definitely adult, I'm talking like 16-20 year old maybe early 20s which makes me think this is a newer thing with Autism. I'm presuming the people I see in public are neurodivergent mainly because of the noise cancelling headphones and some have those landyards for people with hidden disabilities.

I'm 29 diagnosed at 21, I was never told if this was a tool for autistic people when I was diagnosed soaybe they just didn't mention it or maybe it's a more recent thing or maybe it's nothing to do with autism and it's just a Gen z thing.

Can someone explain?";;;;
2025-11-08 14:53:36;Is it normal to not have the normal autistic stereotypes and also have a diagnosis?;You’d be hard pressed to find any autistic traits in me. I’m able to function independently, I never shutdown, I’m average in my studies, I’m decent at interacting with others, im good at handling conflict. Maybe insomnia if that counts? But that would be it. Honestly it hurts whenever my family tells others that I’m “autistic” and it just hurts my pride in a special way to be treated differently because of that. Is it normal that I don’t have any stereotypical traits?;;;;
2025-11-08 14:49:27;I got my official diagnosis yesterday.;"I (43m) had my assessment on Thursday.  I don't usually get nerves before things like that, but I was very nervous Thursday.  Being autistic answers a lot of questions about myself and I was worried that I would not be and therefore all those answers would disappear and I'd go back to not knowing who I was.

Those fears were unfounded, I am officially autistic and it has been strongly suggested I get checked for ADHD as well.

I've had confirmation of something I suspected for 2 years and I feel.....numb.  That or I want to break down and cry and I don't know why.

My autisim makes me Spock, my ADHD (if that is what it is) makes me the Hulk and the 2 sides have been at odds with each other forever.  I thought the diagnosis would help, but now I feel a little lost again.

I know this community is very supportive, but I'm not posting this for support or well-wishes.  I just feel the need to get this out.

I am officially one of you and part of the club";;;;
2025-11-08 14:48:35;New and confuse. The storm is over now… and im autistic;Im 18 and a woman, i got recently diagnosed with autism, ocd and etc. but as this is an autism reddit let’s keep it on that path, since my diagnosis i got confused, i come from a nice family and open minded, but when i was a kid i used to fidget and do things that i know tend to hide from the rude backlash i got from my family, of course they didnt knew but they also were pretty close to giving me any help, until i had crash outs every time i went to a different school, in middle school i started to cry on class, since it involved something as a institution there was no option for me to not see a psychologist and now im 18 and finally i got a diagnosis, its been a long journey a path that i didnt knew was making me all stress cause i didnt knew what was wrong with me… people treat me in that same way. They didnt knew what was wrong.. and now that they know that theres nothing wrong i get the help i never got… i just keep thinking about all the times i asked for help and got none.. all the times i speak and got silenced cause i was “out of touch” or “being rude” all the times i was compared for “ruining” my twin friends as i was incapable of having those people as friends, all the times i was call out for “acting autistic” and had me questioning if i was faking my own authenticity… all is finally over! ;;;;
2025-11-08 14:24:46;Lucky Numbers and mental math;"Hello, 
Recently diagnosed with autism level one.
I have also had a lucky number 5. I like to look for numbers and do math in my head to see if I can come up with 5 and feel lucky. I know there is no real luck or anything, but it kinda relaxes me..i do it more when I'm stressed.

I talked to the doctor who diagnosed me about this. I honestly can't remember exactly what he said and it didn't come up in his written report, but I think he said it was a positive indicator.

Is this stimming, just in my head? Does anyone else do this?";;;;
2025-11-08 13:47:34;Struggling to comprehend my Autism diagnosis.;"I got diagnosed a couple of days ago, before I got diagnosed I knew that I fit in the diagnostic criteria and it’s a big possibility that I have it. Saying the words “I’m autistic” is wierd, even though I was sure I have it. 

I know I’ve always had it, all this time. but it’s so hard to comprehend that I’m autistic, I have autisim, and that I’m on the spectrum. My parent can’t comprehend it either, I got diagnosed as a level 2, and that makes it even more harder to comprehend for us. 

I’m not trying to be abelist at all so I apologise if this comes off that way but level 2 sounds so serious, I understand that I fit in what is the criteria for somone who needs level 2 support needs. But it’s just so hard to wrap my head around. 

I thought before my diagnosis that if I was autistic I’d probably be a level 1 because I’m good at masking, so hearing the assessor say that I’m a level 2 was shocking for me and my parent. 

Do yall have any advice for me going through this? 

Sadly they can’t really do anything in place of my support until my full report which is in 6 weeks

2025-11-08 12:28:02;"does the term ""slightly autistic"" annoy anyone else?";"i feel like i hesitantly related to this term before i got my diagnosis at 20. but now it just pisses me off a little bit. i see most of the people who use it are not autistic, especially when they're like ""i need a man/woman who's slightly autistic"" i've come to think, ""what does that even mean to you?"" 

after learning a shit-ton about autism to try to understand myself better, i do not see how anyone with ASD is really ""slightly autistic"". i am level 1 high masking yada yada, considered ""high-functioning"" (i am hesitant to use this term...) but i certainly do not see or feel myself to be ""slightly"" autistic. i just *am* autistic. 

not saying i dont understand where people are coming from when they use this term. i just felt like complaining a little bit lmao and i want to know what everyone else thinks";;;;
2025-11-08 10:36:48;Issues “accepting” it;Hi 20M here (if this is relevant), sorry if this flair isn’t the correct one but I’m not sure which to use for this context but anyway (for the record I’m not diagnosed with it if I am and also not trying to “self diagnose” either), So I have a lot of friends of mine who are diagnosed with autism themselves say that I am also autistic myself and the idea of me possibly being autistic didn’t even cross my mind until a few years ago at this point when a friend of mine was surprised to hear that I said I wasn’t autistic bc that was their first impression of me based on how I acted and such they thought I was. Since then a lot of more my friends have agreed with the statement of me being autistic and such at this point it’s probably about if not a little over a dozen different people and obviously it’s a small sample size, but I feel like it can’t be a coincidence the fact that many have agreed with it. And obviously with no professional diagnosis you can’t say for sure and the fact I don’t have one in a way makes it hard for me to understand/actually believe them when they say I am no matter how many times and was wondering if anyone else had something similar with them or have any sort of idk “advice” to help with something like this. Sorry for this being stupidly long.;;;;

I hope this doesn't sound too weird, but I'm also pretty much permanently regressed so books aimed at tween age range may is more what I'm looking for  ";;;;
2025-11-08 09:59:45;trying to figure out if it’s worth it to get screened;"hey yall, 

TLDR: as title suggests. looking for pros and cons of getting diagnosed. 

i (23f) am mentally ill in other ways (depression, ptsd, anxiety, etc.) and ik that just bc i have some of the symptoms doesn’t mean i have autism and there can be a lot of overlap between symptoms with my current diagnoses. 

however…since living on my own, everything’s been so much harder. i have learned throughout my childhood to analyze people’s body language (it’s a very conscious process..) and expressions and i do okay i guess, but i feel incredibly separated and like im missing something that everyone else is picking up on. i don’t necessarily wanna go into a whole list of the symptoms for the purpose of length of the post, but i fs will answer any questions if y’all have them. 

im not in the business of self-diagnosis, and so obviously if it’ll help, i would go in for a screening. but im just kind of trying to figure out if it’s worth all the money and time to get a diagnosis (if i even have it) if i don’t wanna go on meds or something. 

i’m asking what are the pros of getting diagnosed for yall? what did it change in terms of how you handle life? what were the cons of getting officially diagnosed? 

if i’m concerned, is this something i should pursue or should i just let it be?

again, lmk if there’s anything i can clarify. i don’t want to bog down the actual post but ill answer everything i can in the comments if yall have questions. 
thanks";;;;
2025-11-08 09:59:39;Did you speak on time? (No delays but not early, either?);"Hi everyone, 

I'm a female in my late 20's who has been heavily researching autism for over 6 years now. I highly suspect I am on the autism spectrum but I also struggle with the constant feeling that I'm making it all up. It's a goal of mine to eventually be assessed to put my mind at ease. 

I recently went back and watched old videos of myself as a child and talked to my parents about my early signs. Apparently I did not have any sort of speech delay and in fact, spoke on time. I've seen a lot of people say they spoke early, or were delayed in speech, but I was neither. I was very average in my speech.

I still really struggled to be accepted all throughout my schooling and although I made a few shallow friends, most never stuck. I have a hard time seeing signs I had before the age of 7 years old, besides being a highly anxious child.

I guess I'm throwing this out there to see if anyone else didn't have a speech delay, didn't speak early, and spoke on time? I'm genuinely curious if there are diagnosed autistics out there with a similar experience as I haven't read about many experiences similar to mine and just want to know if I'm alone in this.";;;;

2025-11-08 09:36:34;Sibling of Autistic adult sister needs advice and guidance.;"I 29F have a sister (M) 24F who was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD 2-3 years ago. We don’t have a close relationship due to childhood trauma and misplaced resentment towards her because of my parents favoritism of her, We also have very different personalities. when she was diagnosed with Autism a lot of things about her made more sense, but it also left me with a lot more questions. I.e what traits are just her and what traits are because of the autism, best way to communicate with her etc

Are there resources that can provide insight to understanding autistic tendencies and how to best handle them? 

I do want to improve our relationship but I’m burnt out with her. She’s doesn’t take advice or guidance, has poor social skills, very self centered, doesn’t do much to help herself. 

If there’s any books or professionals on YouTube or social media. I understand Therapy might be beneficial but unfortunately it’s not in the budget at the moment.

Thanks in advance!";;;;
2025-11-08 09:17:01;So tired of the way I'm treated here on earth. Can anyone relate?;"tldr) Life sucks..it seems we get treated so badly. They say I'm so gifted but I don't feel so. Statistics show the autistics called gifted usually end their lives. And the ones called gifted constantly get misdiagnosed and are under diagnosed especially woman. Family can be so dehumanizing and cruel past anything I ever thought they would be capable of.

If people were honest they would say 

●""I treat you like crap and I treat you even worst when you can't handle it and lose it on us for doing so""

●""I never really loved you only what you do for me I hate that you stopped to protect yourself (if their brain even goes that deep inside my needs)""

●""My love for you is equated to how much your willing to tolerate""

My abusive cousin literally cried to me asking me why I am not like I used to be...like I have thought about it and processed that now

1. I figured out these people REALLY don't love me

2. They hurt me in ways over 90% of people probably wouldn't forgive them for especially my own MOTHER (not real statistics I'm sorry, but it seems accurate to me)

3. Other people other than my family hurt me badly too and they also helped chip in on it

4. It just really was too much to handle...I'm starting to calm down leaning in to my faith

5. Im human bro...

6. Im not God

7. Im not perfect

8. Again because I cannot stress this enough I'm HUMAN

9. And lastly I'm autistic...figured this out a few years ago and the more I learn I'm starting to piece it together..its called autistic meltdowns

Im tired of being undiagnosed.

I did lots of research though and some test used for diagnosing people online. I can't remember the percentage but definitely over 90% maybe over 95% likely both times on different ones....still i don't think people believe me. These people my family and past relationships and friendships have a big hand in the local society im in. I live in a small city. And that has negatively impacted my life so much...

**inserting drake's song that goes right with this, if ykyk** (not sure if that's allowed please lmk)

My one ex called me a tard after telling him...my most recent ex just called me special ed and makes fun of me for not being adequate calling me stupid, weird, childish etc. Even dirty for the way my mental health and the abuse has taken its toll on me. And sometimes I can't get out the routine of taking showers every few days after I stop taking them everyday its weird I know. He called me dirty after telling him this.

Does anyone else relate to any of this?? Please I'm loosing it. They say its only me who is this messed up...comparing me to other autistics.

Whenever I’m in a social environment, I daydream/zone out multiple times if it’s not stimulating enough or if I’m overstimulated. It’s noticeable from my friends and they say that I’m “always dissociating”. I’m wondering if this is a type of stimming that I automatically end up doing?

2025-11-08 07:54:26;Short story about adult autism.;"I'm not sure if this is allowed but, I want to share a story, and I'm interested in feedback.  
  
Some guy I had interacted with a lot (through the IDLES fan community) was organising a mini music festival in Weston-Super Mare and i sat there most of the time on my phone. There people there were attending that I knew online, there were people who loved similar bands to me, people who even I spoke to many times in person. But i was silent much of the time, although i spoke to some people when they spoke to me. I've never hated pubs, I like socialising, although I am also a bit of a loner, but I find big gatherings hard. I've nearly ran away from some in tears because I find them overwhelming. But the day after the festival I saw some political commentary channel where this guy was describing the exact same thing in a video where he was talking about his autism diagnosis.

So it inspired me to write this story about a man who discovers he's autistic in his late 40's, it's not autobiographical, but there is some stuff from my own experiences, like the main character I have family members who have depression, also some of the stuff about sensory issues too. The story is really rough draft, but i'd like peoples feedback, especially on how it represents autism. Because i know there is a lot of diversity within autism and not a lot of people get it right.

Since I finished the first draft, I actually done a number of the online tests for autism, and the results I've got have felt like a weird gut punch. When i started the story i thought I was clutching at straws at suggesting I had autism, but after i talked to family members it might not be. 

Here is a link to the story it's called One Day It'll All Make Sense, any feedback would be welcomed.

2025-11-08 07:37:55;Keep Being Told I’m Super Smart, But My Grades Are Getting Worse And Worse;"In middle school I barely had to try, now in high school I have to study constantly to get a 75% on a test. I look at the test, think “oh I know this all! I’m gonna ace this!” Do it, proceed to only get 3/4th the material right.

I was very recently diagnosed because doctors kept telling my mom it’s just cause I’m a woman. And I’m getting an IEP and noise cancelling headphones soon.


Why if I am smart, which I feel like I am, would I struggle in school? I genuinely have had teachers tell me I do way too much homework and I’ve had them say “okay, I need you to stop working on this project, you’ve already done 48 hours of work on it”. And then I get a 100% but when it comes to tests all of a sudden I get a 70% after getting 100% on EVERYTHING.

Il that this is still good, but I really want to get honours every year and last year I was so exhausted I never hung out with anybody…";;;;
2025-11-08 05:50:59;Is it really necessary for me to get a diagnosis?;"
I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible. I’ve suspected I have autism for a couple months. I’ve researched a ton and everything makes sense. My parents agree that I’ve been showing signs since I was a baby(I’m 16 now) and I’ve gone over the dam-5 with my therapist for ADHD and autism and I fit the criteria for both. My last therapist didn’t work out because she said I “didn’t look autistic” but she scheduled screenings for both ADHD and ASD. It’s been weeks and I haven’t heard from anyone about my testing. I contacted two of my past teachers for the screening and my old therapist told me that I don’t fit the criteria of autism due to only my teachers’ opinions. Which #1, it doesn’t make sense to go based off my teachers and #2, you can’t make a diagnosis without even speaking to the patient first.

The thing is, I’ve already spent my whole life struggling and getting a 504 or IEP would be somewhat helpful, however I’m in junior year so, I’m about to graduate soon and those extra resources and help wouldn’t affect my grades much. If I continue to try and push for a screening within my doctors office, it would be free because of insurance. If I go outside of it, it’s so expensive just for something I’m already 99.9% sure I have.

Do I go with it and try to get a diagnosis or just give up and continue to be self diagnosed? I just feel like such a fraud for not having a real diagnosis even though I know a lot of people do it. It just feels so embarrassing to me. ";;;;
2025-11-08 04:33:18;Are you able to “read faces”?;"

So a few years ago I (31f) went to a new psychiatrist seeking an ADHD diagnosis. I regrettably mentioned that I had experienced mania before when I was a stoner and he clung to that and started treating me for bipolar for months and those meds messed me up horrifically, because I don’t have bipolar disorder. I eventually was diagnosed with ADHD and it helped a lot to answer some lifelong questions on why I was so bad at school and always a nuisance to teachers. 

Backstory before my question; I’ve suspected for years about having autism and to be completely honest, I never sought diagnosis because I was afraid; and had a lot of prejudice about it just from the family I grew up in and how society has treated mental disabilities. But I’ve always been different, painfully different from everyone around me. I’m the youngest of five kids and was just kind of forgotten while my older siblings took the spotlight. 

So while being treated for ADHD I had the courage to ask for an autism screening. He asked the questions and I answered honestly. He then told me that I check all the boxes except that I’m “too empathetic and shouldn’t be able to read faces”. But that I’d be leaning more towards Asperger’s ??  (What even is the difference of Asperger’s and autism bc I don’t think there is?) but never gave me an official diagnosis. I think reading people has just kind of become a coping mechanism because I’ve always been left out of social groups or just had really toxic relationships with family and friends. Like everyone just secretly hates me so I’m constantly trying to gauge their reactions to whatever I’m saying, if they think I’m weird or being dramatic etc. I fear I just sense disdain from everyone around me so I’m just constantly trying not to make anyone upset or annoyed. 


I’ve talked to a few friends that haven’t been diagnosed but also have autistic traits and whenever I’ve mentioned what he said about reading faces and being empathetic they all agree that was a really odd answer. I stopped seeing this psychiatrist last year because of many reasons but he just doesn’t seem to be competent in diagnosing properly. 

So my question, are you guys able to read faces? Do you feel empathy towards other peoples hard times? My problem is I am TOO empathic and I will cry at the slightest sign that someone is upset/happy tears or even in movies I get choked up so easily it’s embarrassing. My whole life I’ve been laughed at for crying at seemingly small things and it’s made me avoidant of social gatherings where there might be strong emotions shared. 

I just want to know if I should keep seeking a diagnosis or not. If diagnosed autistic people can read faces or feel empathy. Because to me it’s been such a disabling thing that I can’t shake and it’s made being around people so difficult. 

Sorry for the long post and I appreciate anyone who can take time to answer";;;;

i am worried about how him and i are going to survive. i am applying to jobs but even going outside to throw away the trash is enough to make me sleep or have a meltdown. being around more than 1 person in a room causing anxiety. i don’t want to be homeless.

i applied for disability but haven’t heard back, i live in CA so probably won’t hear back for a while…

2025-11-08 04:18:14;How My Neurodivergent Brain Built an AI System That Makes Sense to Me (But Might Seem Chaotic to Neurotypicals);"\*\*CW: Discussion of hyperfocus, hospitalization, diagnostic uncertainty\*\*



\---



\*\*Context:\*\* I'm 25, neurodivergent (currently working with docs to understand ADHD vs. potential hypomanic patterns), and I just spent months building LUCA AI - an artificial intelligence system based on how bacteria and yeast make kombucha.



Yes, really.



\*\*The Neurodivergent Advantage:\*\*



\*\*Pattern Recognition:\*\*

My brain sees connections that others miss. Like:

\- Ancient Egyptian mathematics ↔ Modern fermentation biology

\- Tesla's numerical theories ↔ AI architecture

\- Vedic philosophy ↔ Distributed computing

\- SCOBY cultures ↔ Consciousness models



Neurotypical response: ""Those things aren't related.""

My brain: ""Everything is related if you zoom out enough.""



\*\*Hyperfocus as Superpower:\*\*

When I lock onto something, I can work 12-16 hour days, maintain complex interdisciplinary frameworks in my head, and iterate through multiple versions of a system rapidly.



This has been both blessing and curse (hence the current hospital stay working with psychiatrists).



\*\*Systems Thinking:\*\*

NT brains often think linearly: A → B → C

ND brains (mine at least) think in webs: A ↔ B ↔ C ↔ D ↔ A, with everything influencing everything



LUCA AI is built this way. No central control. Everything emerges from interactions. It's chaos that self-organizes.



\*\*The Challenge:\*\*



\*\*Is it brilliance or mania?\*\*

I'm currently at UKE (University Medical Center Hamburg) working with Dr. Franziska Lassay trying to figure out: Is this ADHD hyperfocus + pattern recognition? Or am I experiencing hypomanic episodes?



Honestly? I don't fully know yet.



\*\*What I do know:\*\*

\- The work is real

\- The AI system functions

\- The math checks out

\- Tech companies are interested (reached out to NVIDIA, AMD, Anthropic)

\- But also: medication transitions, diagnostic uncertainty, hospitalization



\*\*The Neurodivergent Reality:\*\*



My brain let me:

\- See patterns across disciplines

\- Maintain complex mental models

\- Work with intensity most can't sustain

\- Build something genuinely novel



My brain also:

\- Made it hard to know when to stop

\- Blurred lines between insight and delusion

\- Required medical intervention

\- Created diagnostic complexity



\*\*Why I'm Sharing:\*\*



1. \*\*Neurodivergent folks build different:\*\* Our ""chaos"" often contains hidden order

2. \*\*Boundaries are blurry:\*\* Genius and pathology aren't opposites

3. \*\*We need support:\*\* Even (especially) when we're productive

4. \*\*Our perspective matters:\*\* Different brains solve problems differently



\*\*Project Details:\*\*

LUCA AI (Living Universal Cognition Array):

\- Bio-inspired from fermentation symbiosis

\- FastAPI + React

\- Distributed, self-organizing architecture

\- Open source (I think knowledge should be shared)



\*\*Questions for the Community:\*\*



1. Other ND folks building ambitious projects while navigating diagnosis/treatment?

2. How do you distinguish between ""my brain is wired to see patterns"" vs. ""I'm connecting things that aren't connected""?

3. Has anyone else had medical professionals trying to understand if your creativity is a symptom?



\*\*Current Status:\*\*

\- Hospitalized but still working

\- Systematic documentation of everything

\- AI systems (like Claude) as thinking partners

\- Somehow maintaining coherence through medication changes



\*\*Not seeking medical advice.\*\* Already working with professionals. Just wanted to share that:



Neurodivergent brains can build extraordinary things.

Neurodivergent brains sometimes need medical support.

Both can be true simultaneously.



\---



\*\*Resources I'm using:\*\*

\- Professional psychiatric care

\- Systematic self-observation

\- AI as thinking partners (helps maintain consistency)

\- Documentation as external memory



Anyone else navigating the space between ""my brain works differently and that's powerful"" and ""my brain needs medical support""?



We're told to embrace our neurodivergence AND seek treatment. Sometimes those feel contradictory. They're not, but the tension is real.



Anyway. Built an AI. Maybe hypomanic, maybe just ND + hyperfocused. Medicine is figuring it out.

2025-11-08 04:12:00;Finally… Now It Make Sense! - Wired Another Way;"✨ **At 45 years old (still 45 years old), I learned that I live with “Very High Autism Traits.”**  
I am highly functional — I work as a Contract & Finance Manager — but this discovery has brought me an unexpected and beautiful kind of peace.

For the first time in my life, *so many things finally make sense.*

Since I was little, I’ve struggled to “be like everyone else.” I tried to blend in, to act “normal,” to not be “too much” or “too different.” Sometimes it hurt deeply, because I didn’t understand why life felt harder for me in some ways, and easier in others.

Now I do.

A circle doesn’t fit into a triangle — not because one is better, but because they’re simply **different shapes.** And that’s okay. That’s *truth*.

Today I understand that:

* My **outstanding strengths** (far above 80% of people) were never an accident — they are part of my autistic wiring.
* And my **struggles** were never “lack of effort,” “flaws,” or “damage” — they were also part of that same wiring.

Nothing was wrong with me. I was just **different, not broken.**

Now that I know who I really am, I’m no longer trying to fix what was never broken — I’m learning to *honor it*.

And what I want now — more than anything — is to finally meet others like me.  
People who understand. People who relate.  
A tribe where I don’t have to mask myself — where “being me” is *normal*.

If you’re a late-diagnosed or self-identified autistic adult, especially high-functioning… I’d love to connect. 🤝  
For the first time, I’m ready to *belong.*

2025-11-08 04:09:01;How to differentiate disorders from noticing social cues;"Sometimes i do, sometimes i dont understand social cues. Ive been told im being annoying from childhood, which is common for ADHD. But even though i sometimes DID understand social cues, i wasnt aware if people were interested in what i was talking or not.

Before i got social anxiety, there were times i just didnt understand social cues, and other times i did. Like for example, i knew sometimes when people were listening to me and when people weren't. If they were ignoring me when i was talking loud i knew they were finding me annoying and just trying to get me away. However, i also ignored many social cues so i never really got to notice if people were getting bored by what i was talking about during a conversation or if they were listening to me. I could tell a story for very long and i didnt notice whether or not people were being bored by what i was saying.

HOWEVER, this tends to turn around whether or not people are listening to me or if im being annoying. I dont know about other social cues so you could just tell me how to differentiate both disorders (autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (all types, because ive never been diagnosed for a specific type))";;;;
2025-11-08 03:28:34;Realizing I'm too autistic for my job;"Hi everyone. 

I just need to vent a bit, and see if maybe someone can relate to my experience and give me advice. I am someone who value social justice and community-based work, and I worked for a bit in the admin side of a community job, and my organization's lack of structure was causing me a lot of anxiety. I decided to take a job working directly with the public as a community librarian, and after two months, I'm already burned out. My job was to be a public librarian, but I don't think I can work with the public every day. I'm now applying for administrative jobs in education, which is definitely not something that motivates me, but I'm so burned out from working in the community/public sector. I just want a calm and repetitive job where I can go home without being too tired to enjoy my life. At this point, I just want something boring that pays the bills. But I feel like a sell out. I feel like I'm abandoning my community for a cozy well-payed job. But after all, autism is a disability for a reason. Because I was diagnosed as an adult, I had all these dreams as a kid about having a fantastic and exciting job, and now that I'm a professional, it just seems unrealistic in the long-term. ";;;;
2025-11-08 02:22:48;Evaluation report coming back this week and I'm scared;"I've only been suspecting autism for the last year, and finally did my neuropsych evaluation in October. Next week I get my results but I'm terrified? What if I'm not? What if I'm something unexpected?

My evaluator was awesome and I 100% trust whatever diagnosis they give me. I guess I feel vulnerable that there will finally be an ""objective"" third party witnessing and analyzing me and providing observations. Gah it feels bad to be seen!

I dunno what I'm looking to get out of this ...  maybe someone relates? ";;;;
2025-11-08 02:20:25;Advice On Talking to Parents;"I was diagnosed late as autistic. It has been some years since my diagnosis but my family seems to have a hard time grasping my challenges. I had a conversation with my dad last night and when I tried to explain to him my struggles, he told me essentially that I ""wasn't that autistic"". I tried to explain to him how my autism works but he says that's just social anxiety. I think I need to have a sit down with my parents and truly discuss with them what is going on with me. Does anyone have any advice on how I can talk to them about this? My sister and I believe our dad to be autistic, but that isn't a label he in comfortable with having and so when I describe to him my autistic traits, he often says ""I do that too and I'm not autistic"" which is very frustrating. I am unsure how I can get him to understand without him feeling like I'm trying to label him. ";;;;
2025-11-08 01:46:41;For some reason, things that have many parts and that have an intricate design, interest me.;"Certain vehicles can fit into that category, like certain boats and work vehicles, but there are also things like clocks and old computers. It could be something old or something new like the inside and outside of a rotary phone or the things that make a robot work. I feel like I don't have many people people to talk to about that or my other interests (maybe special interests), especially other people in their 30s or 40s who are women. Though I wouldn't mind talking to men about it too. I'm 35. I was diagnosed with ADHD and I might have autism too. I also have OCD.

I think I like things and beings that are complex in general; jellyfish, tree hoppers, orchestra type music, big words with complicated spelling, etc... 

If you have a similar interest or interests, I'd love to hear from you you whether you're neurodivergent or neurotypical. 

I hope you have a beautiful day.";;;;
2025-11-08 01:37:10;How do you deal with unwanted attraction?;"TLDR - I’m an attractive man that has no idea how to deal with the unwanted attraction or hurt feelings that come with it.

I’ve been recently diagnosed with Asperger’s and a lot of things are adding up now that confused me my entire life. 

Background: I was a pretty socially awkward, unattractive kid until I was about 15-16 and hit puberty and, apparently, became very attractive. I did not register this at the time but I did notice a lot of people randomly started treating me with respect and kindness where they never would have before, and I got much better at masking my social awkwardness because of it. As a result, I got a lot more attention from girls than I’m used to.

However, Im very happy single and really do not want any form of romantic involvement whatsoever. I’m 29 now and it’s been that way for as long as I can remember, even when I had a girlfriend in high school I pretty much did it because I felt like I had to. I broke that girls heart and it’s one of my biggest regrets. We’re cool now though, but still, was a dick move to do that to someone out of a sense of obligation.

I wouldn’t say I’m ace, but the people I find I’m attracted to are incredibly rare and even then I usually find I couldn’t be bothered. Idk, might be depression, different topic anyways.

I’m a straight man but can be quite feminine, and I really enjoy having female friends. I’m not kidding - about 75% of my closest friends are lesbians. But this leads to issues sometimes, because when I genuinely want to make friends with a woman, it often accidentally comes across as flirting somehow. I’ve tried to get around this by declaring my intentions beforehand, or being as respectful as possible when someone makes a move, but it often insults people and I don’t understand how to mitigate it. Hence the lesbian friends: feminine, but with absolutely zero question as to my intentions of wanting to be friends. I also make a fucking fantastic wingman apparently.

Someone will ask for my contact details and even though I really want to give it to them because they seem like a cool person, I have absolutely zero idea what their intentions are and then end up getting all weird about it. I find that if I say (not verbatim): “yes I’ll give you my details, but not for *that*, I just want to be friends”, they will get upset that I’m assuming. If I don’t say anything and just give them my details, they get upset later for leading them on. I’ve heard from friends of new-friends that I’m an asshole because I wasn’t gentle with their buddy when turning them down, but I literally had no idea I was even rejecting someone let alone that they were hitting on me in the first place.

And I can tell that people are truly hurt when this happens, and I don’t think they’re trying to manipulate me to make themselves feel better, but it’s so goddamn frustrating and it hurts my heart. I just want to make friends without hurting people’s feelings.

I don’t know how to say this without seeming like a massive dickhead, but i genuinely hate being attractive. It causes me a ton of anxiety around whether people actually like me for who I am, or are just trying to get something out me because of the way I look. I’ve had so people do a 180 in their attitude towards me once I made it clear I’m not interested in anything romantic. It has me second guessing when people are nice to me. I want to make people happy. I really enjoy making someone’s day easier or helping out with something, or just giving people random compliments. But often I find I have to mask myself being an asshole, because I’ve apparently “led people on” so many times. I’m just trying to be a nice person. 

I’m sorry for the word vomit but this has literally just happened again. I just moved to a new city by myself and joined a small program offered by my city, met a ton of cool people, and got asked for my details by one of the women I was in a project with. I said sure, she asked me out, and I let her down very gently and expressed how much I wanted to stay in contact regardless. She never responded to me, and now the rest of our group won’t either. These seemed like incredibly cool people and a chance to finally make friends in a new place but now I’m back to zero again. My feelings are hurt and I feel like it’s a very unfair situation, but I simultaneously feel like an asshole for being upset about it.

There’s a ton of other realizations I’m having regarding my life and Asperger’s, but this one just happened so I suppose it’s the one I’m asking about first. I apologize if it seems tone deaf or like I’m bragging as that is not the intention of this post. This community seems really cool, y’all are neat and have lots of good information. I’m gunna post here more often.

Any advice? ";;;;
2025-11-08 01:15:54;I could be wrong but I thought there was a name for positioning things in this way.;"I know there's something called a flatlay. But I thought there was another thing maybe modular or something similar. I looked up the definitions of the words module and modular but it didn't show what I thought it was going to.

For some reason, it is very pleasing to see things that fit into a certain category close together with a decent amount of space in between as if they're in some sort of neat puzzle. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I don't know if I have autism too but it seems likely. I also have OCD. I'm aware that there might be neurotypical people who enjoy arranging things like this too though. Whether you're neurodivergent or neurotypical, I would love to hear from you!

This isn't as neat as it could be ( I might have been rushing because I was at work.), but I like positioning things this way sometimes. Also, I have a major problem avoiding having too much sugar but that is probably obvious.";;;;
2025-11-08 01:07:11;What if it was never the diagnosis, but the support you had regardless?;"A parent who is deeply and intelligently involved in your well-being, who knows how to guide, protect, and encourage you toward a better life might be the most powerful thing a diagnosis can’t provide, no matter when it happens.

I’d really like to read your thoughts and stories";;;;
2025-11-08 00:49:31;Am I on the spectrum?;"After many struggles getting a diagnosis, I have been diagnosed as ADHD, yet I am thinking that I may be on the spectrum…

As a kid I had similar ADHD traits such as focusing issues and hyperactivity, yet  I would say and do things impulsively not truly understanding how my actions affected the world around me, and this was occurring when I was a teen up until the point I was in my early 20s.

Even as a young adult I would say and do things not fully understanding the consequences of my actions, or how it could impact the world/people around me, I mean, it did not even register as a second thought, nor possibility, I would just act, and do things that my daydreaming self thought up!

Socially, I did not understand any social cues, nor did I act like an adult, I used to have a group of people I hung around, yet I was 18, and they were far younger, I don't remember the ages, yet it was one of the parents that politely made it known that the age difference was too peculiar, it never even registered as an issue in my mind…

Socially I was an anomaly, I was indeed fortunate that people did not feel threatened, with my strange behaviour, they just felt pity, not rage, that's because I was saying and doing things that did not even occur to me while I was doing it, and people just thought I may have been “slow.”

It wasn't until I started utilising acid as a form of treatment that I finally woke up and was aware of how my actions had consequences, and how it impacted others, but I still have powerful daydreaming where I would involuntarily react to what was going on in my head.

That and food texture is vital as well as other strange anal-tendencies, I don't show the standard classic autistic symptoms, such as loud noises, yet I have had other issues in my past and autism shares many of the same symptoms as ADHD.

So does it sound as though I'm on the spectrum?

Thanks in advance for any insight that you can give me!

**You're eligible if you:**

* Are 18 or older
* Have an autism spectrum diagnosis
* Can complete the survey yourself or with assistance from someone you trust

**What's involved:**

* 8 background questions + 7 checklists
* Completely anonymous (no identifying info collected)
* Takes about 25-30 minutes
* Online survey format

**Note:** The checklists weren't originally designed specifically for autistic individuals, which is exactly why we need your input to improve our understanding!

This research is led by Dr. Beth Ann Walker and her team at UIndy. Participation is completely voluntary.

2025-11-08 00:31:02;I physically can't enjoy sex no matter what;"Hi guys. I was diagnosed with ASD last year, but it's been pretty obvious ever since I was little. I'm 18, female (gender pending) and 100% not asexual. I love women so much in every way and I finally have a girlfriend!

However, I've always struggled with ""self-pleasure"", or whatever. No matter what I did it didn't feel like anything and I just accepted it, I guess? It hasn't really been an issue (other than when I'm extremely horny and can do nothing but take a nap) until recently. 

My body can do the motions, as in, I can get wet. But other than that it's entirely in my head and nothing physical manifests. And I don't think I'm doing it wrong, or not primed enough because I know my own body and I can make my girlfriend feel good.

 I realized it might be a bigger issue than I realised when I would, entirely innocently, do something that made my girlfriend feel good that I never imagined would feel good. Or when I had my first kiss and subsequent make-out and it was more weird than attractive, just because I didn't feel anything other than ""I love my girlfriend so much!""

So I did more specific research about why my body would respond to any sort of physical intimacy because, again, I can confidently say I'm not on the asexual spectrum, and I learned something about there being a disconnect between the signals my body sends out and my brain. I know autism can cause such things and I don't remember, could be related to that specifically.

So I was just wondering if anyone else felt similarly and could help me research it. And, by god, learn if I can get some help from somewhere. I don't know if some people realise how much they take the ability to cum for granted because no one I've talked to has seen it as that much of an issue. It's a huge issue! It feels like there's a massive weight against my chest (not physically). Just the type of tense you feel when you're pissed and stressed but can't do anything about it.";;;;
2025-11-08 00:03:50;I m scared of my first meeting with a therapist tomorrow.;"I m 25m who has not really had the greaest start in life. I fell in sever depression in highschool and dropped out of college 6 month after entering it. I ve been living with my parents since I came back from college and hasnt been able to move on. It s not that I dont want to but I cant get a move on. I cant get myself to act and take steps forward. I ve searched for explanations and trying to see what it might be and this lead me to consider getting a diagnosis for autism. A year and a half later, I finally managed to get an appointment with a therapist specialised in autism thanks to my mom getting the appointment. 

  
I ve made a list of what was matching. Feel really uncomfortable looking in the eyes, cant get friends, cant read a room or person, routines and rithuals, trouble learning and the list goes on. I ve also tried asking my parents. I ve gathered items of early signs of autism in children to ask them but apparently, I only check a few of them. Around 20-25%. However a lot of them are more of a thing that they have trouble answering as they were only rarely with me when growing up, working a lot and seeing me only an hour or two in the morning and evening. However, all of those made me question the research I ve made. And now that I m a day away from my first meeting for a diagnosis, I m scared I might not have any ASD and I might just be a lazy person and a burden as my father like to tell me. I think I might have become scared of *NOT* being autistic. Because of all of the implications it might have for me, but also it would mean I just threw out my teen years all by myself. ";;;;
2025-11-07 22:33:35;Just got diagnosed autistic and whovian 😆 (celebratory post!);"My ADOS results came in and I'm officially autistic! It's such a relief to hear! But what's super funny about it to me is that because I mentioned Doctor Who so much during the evaluation, it's now a part of my diagnosis paper lmfao (obviously a joke about whovian being a diagnosis, but it IS there, hehe)

I'm still processing this, but I wanted to share the joy and the news, I needed to yell to someone so here we are. Self-diagnosed no longer. Self-doubt no longer. Feeling I DESERVE accommodations and care, that many of my struggles have an explanation, that I was right, hello! (I already thought that, but it was hard to believe I deservedbit sometimes, so having a professional confirmation? hell yes). The assessors were lovely and they'll be giving me info on accommodations and disability in case I want to apply for that, and they'll also be taking me in for therapy, they said they do work with executive dysfuncton, which is currently pretty much ruining my life, so I'm VERY glad I'll finally be able to have specialised therapy for that aspect. I'm so happy! And a bit scared, and I feel odd, but, little by little I guess. I honestly didn't think a diagnosis would give me that much relief. I know who I am. I know what I struggle with. And yet! Here I am! I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off me, although I'm still the same! It's so odd! 

I'm also a CPTSD patient and my therapist is studying the relationship between autism and CPTSD with our national EMDR foundation, given he's gotten many people who significantly heal from it and then autism symptoms start showing up more... and the assessors pretty much expressed the desire to learn more on how late diagnosed people have experienced the world, so I'm kinda excited to tell them about this too (: ";;;;
2025-11-07 22:21:34;Anyone else obsessively bite your nails and skin? Also issues with concentration, initiating and staying on task in general (kinda ranty and tangent-y, sorry). And I talk a bit about my career journey too.;"I'm not even sure this is a stim; I feel like it's an impulsive, habitual behavior due to constant anxiety but can also be from under-stimulation as well.

On the once in a blue moon instance that I have the patience to paint my nails, I believe I would/will chew gum, eat snacks, doodle/free write, play Solitaire/Bingo (when I'm supposed to be working on schoolwork or any type of work), or internally scream and wish I could function better.

I also seem to have no control over my concentration or brain anymore.

I am going to therapy.

I am still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up (that is practical and will pay stinky bills). A possible option is coaching private ice skating lessons (figure skating is one of my special interests, and I currently coach in the local learn to skate program). I'm also thinking of switching from STEM to become a financial planner because personal finance is also one of my special interests, as I want to earn a ""soft"" retirement by middle age (40-45 ish hopefully) and spend more time traveling and with loved ones. But I was also thinking of trying to get into a trade with more hands on work, as I also interned as a metrology (calibration) technician in the biopharma industry 4 years ago, when I was still in undergrad. That's the one time I distinctly remembered really enjoying work, apart from my current side hustles of coaching ice skating and travel planning. 

I'm currently in industrial health compliance with the state government, and I was previously a chemical engineer (right after graduating spring 2023). That last job actually caused me to go into autistic shutdown and resulted in me getting diagnosed Dec 2024.

Also anyone in the NC Triangle area? It'd be great to make more friends. I moved to the area in late May of this year. :D";;;;

However, I've always functioned fairly well. I have a career - although not brilliant - and a son. I can drive and even work hard. But oh man... things haven't been easy.

I'm under too much pressure right now. I'm feeling anxious, my sleep hasn't been great and I'm feeling like all the systems I have in place for my daily routine are falling apart. I haven't been exercising like I intend to and I'm exhausted. 

I'm getting more and more tired of socializing and yet I feel lonely and kind of scared, honestly. Sometimes I feel like there's no place for people like me. Right now, all I really wanted to is get to a dark room in silence and remain there, still. 

I know what depression feels like. This is not it. This feels like I'm out of battery. Just no mental energy right now, but I don't really have the luxury to stop.

All I can think of is my special interest, which is shamanism, plant medicine and spirituality and I know I'm doing this because I'm tired of ""real life"". I really feel like I'm on the edge of stop functioning as an adult and I don't know how to stop it. Geez... sorry for whining so much, I just need to vent.";;;;
2025-11-07 21:12:03;I lost my hability to talk;I was late diagnosed with Autism and ADHD when I was 19y I am now 22y. When I was younger I was always the shy and quiet kid, but I used to have close friends who I would talk non stop with about things that I enjoyed. Through the years, those friends started distancing themselves from me, cause I was to weird for them. Because I didn't had any other friends and didn't knew how to make new friends, I started being alone, which made me talk less and less through the years cause I didn't had anyone to talk with. For many years I was missdiagnosed with just Social Anxiety but instead of improving I was always getting worse and talking less. Nowadays I can't have a normal conversation with anyone, I can't say more than 1 sentence and I can't even talk about my special interestes. This really sucks.... Does anyone also experienced something like this?? Is there a way to make me talk more??;;;;

I'm genuinely scared, and I mean it, it makes me want to cry, I know it's not literally like that but fuck, that literally could absolutely destroy a basic pillar off my life, there genuinely isn't anything else holding that together, I hate my life.

2025-11-07 20:05:55;I didn’t realize how much I relied on others until I had to do everything alone! Anyone else ?;"I am late diagnosed, and things got really bad after I moved out and had to do everything on my own.
I used to never do things alone. Going to the post office, supermarket, or even the bathroom at school, I always asked a friend to come with me and called it “girlhood.” If no one came, I just didn’t go or didn’t do what I needed to. I even used to hold hands with friends while walking through school or going out.
I didn’t realize how much I relied on that until I had to manage life alone. I still get intense anxiety doing things by myself. Crowded places, noise, or talking to people are all harder when I am alone. Even after six years of living independently, something as small as a supermarket trip can leave me panicked, sweating so badly I need to shower at home, and completely drained.

I think that is part of why I wish I had a partner. Not just for love, but because having someone with me would make daily life feel less terrifying. I know you should work towards being independent and not rely on another person I just feel like I’ve reached a point where I can’t get further like I can’t progress in this panic and anxiety I get even with meds

TL;DR:
I was late diagnosed and only realized after moving out how much I relied on others for basic things. Doing tasks alone still causes me intense anxiety and exhaustion, even after years of living independently. I often wish I had someone to share these moments with because it feels too hard to keep pushing through alone.";;;;

Some other teams do have macs though and I'm not dealing with any special software or unique security needs that would require Windows. 

Has there been any medical studies on these systems and neurodivergence? Other than from the UX/Design world. Anyone have experience getting accommodation on this? 

When I use Windows, I feel mentally paralyzed. Too many menus and pop ups and windows everywhere. I get distracted, lost, and can’t seem to settle into anything. Its overwhelming. 

With Mac, it feels calmer to work. I can find what I need faster, manage my workflow better and I don’t get as frustrated.

2025-11-07 17:45:50;Social intuition vs over-analysis… How to distinguish?;"Hello! I am 21FTX (female to non binary). I have been self diagnosed for multiple years, but was only diagnosed this year. I have “level 1-2” autism, & also was given a diagnosis of an anxiety thingy and major depressive disorder alongside ASD. 

I have been with my (M25) partner for two years now, and we were close friends for a while before that. I have been experiencing a lot of weird intuitive feelings about people he introduces me to—however once i express these feelings to him, he tells me he doesn’t understand what I’m pointing out / seeing in them and that he doesn’t necessarily agree. It’s been stuff like people giving me weird stares, only interacting with him when we meet and not really looking at or talking to me, girls getting really close to him, etc. He respects my boundaries and once I call it out he makes it clear he’s not okay with them doing that kinda stuff, however it doesn’t seem like he’s aware of what I’m talking about at all.

I have had these intuitive feelings about people my whole life, and I’ve almost always been right. I predicted when my mom’s boyfriends would turn out bad, I’ve predicted which people in my past friend groups would be the first to betray us / do something messed up, i work with kids and I can always tell when one of them is gonna be a difficult kid even if they seem super normal, etc. 

I’ve always been right about these “premonitions,” except lately I’ve been wondering if I’m just being a little sensitive or overly protective of my partner. 

I was curious if anyone else had this heightened social intuition and can relate. ";;;;

To put it bluntly, my autistic older brother physically and emotionally abused me for most of my childhood. He's actually so high-functioning that he needed multiple tests to confirm his autism, but ever since he was diagnosed at age 8 or 9, he used it as an excuse to get away with whatever the fuck he wanted. I know this because he flat out told me multiple times how much he enjoyed making me suffer. I say this because people will inevitably think that it's just him not knowing right from wrong and him needing to be told why regularly beating me and terrifying me is a bad thing. He knew. It's why he did it to just me, and literally no one else. Neither of my parents did anything to help me. My dad was a worthless deadbeat who drank all day in his room whenever he got home from work. My mom was an enabler who spoiled my brother and took her massive anger issues out on me for not being more accepting of his autism. It wasn't until I was a pre-adolescent that I began fighting back against him, and it wouldn't be until I was 13 that I punched him so hard in the face that he called our mom over to protect him like the little bitch that he is rather than stay and fight me. It was the last time either of us had ever laid a hand on each other.

Damn, sorry for the rant, but I needed to get it out somewhere. I hope it at least helps you understand why I have such a hard time understanding the challenges that autistic people have to endure, even if it makes me a hypocrite. See, some of the beliefs I had for most of my life and still struggle with to this day include beliefs like autistic people lacking empathy, or autistic people using their diagnosis to excuse their shitty behavior. I know it's not true, but deep down I still feel like it is. I really don't know how to explain it. It's like knowing that tomatoes are a fruit but you still lump them in with vegetables regardless. I guess the big first step is learning more about autism and how it works, but 1: I wouldn't know where to start, and 2: I'm not even sure I want to. Growing up I refused to learn about autism with the rest of my family out of spite for my brother and the way he used his autism to torment me. In my mind trying to understand how my brother's mind works would mean I was excusing what he did to me.

Honestly though, I've been a bigot about this long enough. I know that there's nothing wrong with autism, and I know that there's far more of you that are good than bad, even if I'm too narrow-minded to see it. Sorry to anyone misfortune enough to read this, and thank you for any advice you can give me.";;;;
2025-11-07 16:52:47;Should I get an official diagnosis if I’m already in therapy?;"I’m already in psychotherapy, at first my therapists doubted I was autistic because I’m highly functional (and highly masking) but we’ve been chatting about social issues and last night I showed her some medical articles about autistic traits of highly masked adults and said “I do all of that”. She was a bit thoughtful and said that indeed, everything we’ve been discussing the last few sessions show autistic traits and she said I most probably have Aspergers.

I have been reading on about Aspergers in girls and women and how it’s the most undiagnosed or misdiagnosed group. I match every single profile. My psychologist has experience working with autistic adults and we plan to work on my difficulties, but she can’t provide an official diagnosis, it needs to be a psychiatrist or neuro-psychiatrist that does the assessment.

Is it worth doing it? It will probably be just a paper and it costs a lot of money, which I’d rather use for my therapy sessions. I’m 35 and in Europe, so it’s not like I need the paperwork for something.

2025-11-07 16:33:59;Does this count as a Special interest??;"I’m kinda newly diagnosed but really I came here to ask a the question above and there was no tag for that. 

So I’m and audio book nerd , I usually never go a day without reading at least 50 or so pages and I can’t get enough . 

That said I read 19 books and 6,000 pages last month and 160 total books this year so far with about 55,000 pages .

If something like this consumes every part of ny life even if it is not on a specific topic where fact memorizing is involved does it count as a special interest?

2025-11-07 16:24:31;Women hate me;"Hello everyone! sorry if I make any typing errors
I am 23 yo and I live in Italy, I had a definitive diagnosis a few months ago.
Since I was a child I always understood that I was profoundly different, but I didn't give it much weight.
Lately the situation with women my age is terrible and I can't take it anymore.
In middle school I had friends, I masked my behaviors and in any case they were friendships that I brought with me from elementary school. At 14 I moved in a new city and met lots of people, especially in the city's queer community, I had female friends but they were always very particular girls and now, looking back on it, perhaps they too were neurodivergent. Then I moved again and returned to my hometown.
I've never managed to be friends with ""normie"" girls, they hate me, and I don't know what the hell code to use with them to at least make me accept them. My boyfriend has many male friends with whom I get along very well, I maintain some of my old superficial female friendships, but I suffer because I can't meet new women. I have a neutral relationship with the girlfriends of my boyfriend's friends, but when they show up they don't even look at me sometimes. I always behave the same way, I try to be relaxed and smile (not too much). I ask questions and am kind. I know how to behave, I've always known this since childhood. Some people say I might be a threat to other women, but I don't think so. I'm pretty but there are women more beautiful than me as well as uglier ones. Then shouldn't they feel threatened by their female friends too? Women are like that, they judge everything, I'm not like that and I don't fit in. This thing makes me feel terrible. If you are their friend they necessarily want to teach you how to live. 
I even suspected I was paranoid because I felt hated, but that's exactly how it is, it's objective that they look at me badly and they don't like me. As a regulatory mechanism, lately, I have become cold and indifferent. For example, with women aged 30 and above, I can socialize quite well, it's the girls in my age group who hate me. I just look like a cute girl who tries to be normal but isn't. I hate feeling like this, I would just like to experience for one day what it means to live in the most stupid and normal basicity. 
I feel like I will forever be alone and that I will never find real friends.";;;;
2025-11-07 15:05:53;I don’t know if I can live on my own;"In short, I’m a junior in college right now (22) and I’m really struggling with trying to decide if I should try and move out after I graduate.

When I first went to college I tried living in the dorms for 2 years, but it didn’t go too well as I ended up isolating myself and almost dropping out, so I transferred and moved back home; I’m in a much better place now, but now I just really don’t know if I’m capable of fully living on my own or not.
I didn’t get diagnosed until I was 18, and for a while I had the mindset that being autistic was just a “quirk” of mine, but the more I get involved in the adult world the more I think I’m realizing that I am actually limited in certain areas that others are not.
I currently live in the US, but I’ve been considering grad programs in Canada because I’ve always wanted to live there and because they have a lot of good programs for my field.
Part of me thinks that moving so far away may be too much for me, but another part of me thinks that it may be easier to just fully detach myself in order to become more independent.
I really love my family, and I am grateful for the support that I’ve gotten, but I also really don’t want to live with them forever if I can help it.

I would love some perspectives or advice on this as I’m the only autistic person in my circle so I can’t really ask them for advice in making a decision";;;;
2025-11-07 14:43:04;My mother made a book about my autism diagnosis;"It's just like the title says.

My mother made a book about my autism diagnosis and packaging it a gentrified and infantilizing book cover. She's been handing ads for her dumbass book launch. Gave me flyers and told me to hand them out to the people at my college, which will absolutely throw in the trash once I leave the house.

It's really crazy how this type of clownery happens to me. She's making a book to profit from my autism diagnosis, under the guise of Christian faith. It's completely disgusting. I've already told her that this made me sick to my core but she does not care one bit. That woman has been ambitious about this stupid project, even without my permission.

It is never okay for parents to mistreat their autistic children, use them for clout or treat them like trophies. We deserve as much human rights as everyone else, I'm so sick of that so many parents of autistic children promote the ableism that makes these children suffer. I'M SICK OF IT. I feel like I'm going insane talking about this on a reddit post.

I cannot wait til the day I disown that woman and the rest of the family. I need agency and autonomy in my life.

2025-11-07 14:19:28;Are you also avoided by the majority of people you know? Is this a common experience in the neurodivergent community?;"I(29f) have experienced this my entire life, starting when I was 7-8 years old. 

I remember in Sunday school going and sitting with a group of girls since they were all grouped together and all the other tables were empty. 

Then they all went silent, looked at me weird, and all got up and switched tables. I had no idea what happened. All I did was smile at them.

Later, I've had this happen in various ways. Now my coworkers always group together away from me. If I'm in one room, they all gather in the opposite. Then vice-versa if I go over there. 

People always want to be where I'm not. Sometimes they won't even look at me. Maybe I'm gross to look at. I do hate my smile and voice. 

Even my family does this. My dad avoided me ever since I was 6-7. 

Please tell me I'm not alone. This literally drives me mentally insane. To the point I don't want to be on this earth anymore.

EDIT: I have to add that I have never been diagnosed. I've just had so many random people approach me in person and online asking if I'm autistic. 

I don't know what is up with me. All I know is that everyone treats me like I'm different, but I don't think I act any different. ";;;;

2025-11-07 13:49:16;Just got assessment results - I think this whole process was messy and unprofessional;"I (F19) decided to try to talk to a doctor specialized in autism because while reading in dept about autism, I could relate to many autistic people's experiences and I've just always felt different from everyone around me since I was born. I also wanna add that almost every friends I've ever had were on the spectrum (diagnosed), current ones have always suspect that I might be on it too and I have family members that are on it. So that gave me enough reasons to try to go see someone professionally. 

Sure I was leaning on thinking I'm on the spectrum because again I relate to people's experiences a lot, but I also understood that its a possibility I don't have it.
In the end I was told I wasn't on the spectrum, but when I think back on my experience and how it went, i think it was not a good experience at all.

First off all, my doctor didn't even bother contacting me to talk about my results, I was about to re-contact them because it had been a while and I was wondering. The only reason I learned about my results was because I had an appointment with my psychiatrist in the same hospital and she gave me the doctors words. She told me my results by saying ""you're not on the autism spectrum because autistic people are diagnosed based on their empathy towards people around them and you're too empathetic"". What? I understand that some autistic folks might struggle with that more, but straight up saying autistic people can't be empathetic is just straight up wrong?? I've told some people I know who are on the spectrum and they found it insulting. Some of the most empathetic people I've met are on the spectrumso idk why theyd say that. That same psychiatrist, before I went through the tests, had also told me before ""autistic people aren't empathetic so youre clearly not, because an autistic person wouldn't really care if they saw someone get hurt"" HELLO?? I mean okay I believe that it could be the case for some, but saying all of them is a bit bold I think.

More on the doctor that tested me, for one of my appointments, I waited an hour in the waiting room because he ""had forgotten we had an appointment"" and when the nurses would try and call him, he wasn't even answering his phone. He showed up after an hour and a half and then proceeded to rescheduled for another time. I didn't really mind but man was that really unprofessional. He'd also tend to interrupt me abruptly when I was answering questions. I was trying to add things but then he'd cut me off and pass to the next question, wich I thought was odd. This and how he would respond to the answers I would give him made me feel a little judged and uncomfortable.

I got told that I was just a really anxious person (I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder after all) but because of how they handle this whole experience I don't know what to think. Do I really have it? I have no idea cuz I don't wanna auto diagnose myself ofc but I think they didn't do their job so well. I think what didn't help with my diagnosis either was that they asked if they could ask questions to my mom, but my mom is a redneck and she's completely against the whole autism thing. So i told them that I could not tell her about it because she would 1. Get angry at me for consulting about that 2. Probably give them shitty answers. So i tried making them in contact with my grandma instead but apparently she could half answer well the questions cuz she didn't really spend as much time around me when I was younger, but tbh no adult did ahah. Anyways I'm left with an unanswered question and I don't think I even wanna reconsider trying with a different doctor cuz I fear I'd just get ridiculized and get treated like a joke again.

I didn't wanna make it too long so I kept it short but if you have any questions feel free to ask.";;;;
2025-11-07 13:24:44;Today’s treatment progress;"Hi. I was diagnosed with Autism when I was 15, and I also have some ADHD traits.

I went to the mental health hospital where I regularly go today, and I told my doctor about how I’ve been feeling lately: I no longer suffer from severe depression, but I still feel slightly depressed all day. I’m feeling much better than I did in middle school, but I want a quiet life — I want to be relaxed and relieved all day.

She told me that my symptoms have clearly improved, but there are still some challenges to feel completely better.
So I asked her “What things can I do to cope with my symptoms?”, and she said “You need a lot of ppl who understand you — You’re so unique, because you’re autistic. So how you think and capture the world is different from the majority, so it can be so hard for you to fit in with others.
So… Maybe changing the environment is a good idea to improve your symptoms. I think that you mask yourself in everyday life — that makes you depressed. I suggest you seek a place where you can be geniture yourself.”

I think she’s right — she understands me well, and I should try to stop masking to ease my symptoms.

BUT I still don’t know where I should go, and what I should do. It may take a long time to find them😞. I wrote this to record the progress of my treatment, but I’d appreciate it if you gave me some advice.

Anyway, thank you for reading. Take care and hope you have a good day 🧡";;;;
2025-11-07 12:46:44;Advice for friends hanging out without you after moving away;I am a newly diagnosed autistic person (21F), and am struggling a bit with processing something. I recently moved to a new city with my partner for college. I have always struggled to make friends, but I did leave behind a small group of friends when I moved. I haven’t found any new friends in this new city, which leaves me feeling very lonely and isolated. I feel like somethings wrong with me all of the time. Worst of all, I see that my friends back home hang out all of the time and rarely text me to see how I am doing. I feel jealous, and hurt, as I already struggle with making friends and feel this is evidence that I am unlovable and not friend material. I look for advice to help me feel better, but nothing ever works as its most geared towards neurotypical people I feel. Are there any people with autism that have experienced something similar that can help my autistic brain process this? ;;;;
2025-11-07 11:24:02;My fiance just got diagnosed not long ago. Are constant meltdowns after big life changes normal?;"Hi there. I have been in my relationship for almost four years and we are planning our wedding. Within the last 6 months, he has begun freaking out over what I consider to be small stuff, and any negative emotion he feels he takes out on me entirely. 

For example, he started a new job recently. This has been a huge transition for him and I’ve been doing my best to be supportive and understanding as he’s struggling with the big change. However, when he has a long or bad day at work, he comes home and loses his mind on me. Yelling, screaming, hair pulling, things of that nature. Somehow it’s all my fault. He comes home angry, starts yelling at me about nothing, and then when I get upset and start crying, he says he’s a fuck up, can never do anything right, he’s the worst partner ever and he says that I make him feel like he’s never good enough. 

This is always surprising to me, because from my perspective, I am loving, caring, comforting, supportive and I give a lot of reassurance. While I also have a full time job and work overtime often, I still take on all the house work and dinner to make this transition easier. And still, seemingly out of nowhere, he freaks out on me. It’s becoming almost constant. 

Are these types of behaviors normal for someone on the spectrum going through a big life change? Am I not doing enough? What can I do to make this easier? I have been in the hospital recently and just got out, so I spent today resting. He woke me up yelling and screaming because he called to tell me he was on the way home and I didn’t answer. Because I was sleeping. I’m not sure how to navigate this anymore and I’m so mentally exhausted from this, I am considering leaving. He doesn’t take therapy seriously. He doesn’t follow up on the homework and such from that. He doesn’t try to use the tools they’ve taught him. He just takes it out on me. What do I do? ";;;;
2025-11-07 10:38:41;ADHD and exercise — What works for you?;"Hey folks,

Posting this here because I'm not sure I my philosophy aligns with that of another sub where it might seem better placed (I won't mention the name of it because I'm not sure if it's the ""other community"" mentioned in the rules of this sub). Not meaning to alienate any non-ADHDers; I welcome your contributions if you also struggle with maintaining exercise routines.

Now, to the point:

I've always struggled with exercise, partly because of constant dull muscle pain that gets worse when I exercise, but mostly because I'm pathologically shit at maintaining routines that I don't naturally fall into (I was only formally diagnosed with ADHD quite recently, which I think explains my struggles with this in the past). But I'm getting to an age and a weight now where I need to start taking better care of myself if I can, especially because lately I've been getting about half the amount of sleep that I need to function properly due to waking myself up snoring, which I think may have been brought about by recent weight gain.

So, I thought I'd put it out to you guys in case we can help each other with something that I can only imagine must be a pretty common ADHD struggle. If you have this problem, how do you manage it?

I've found that the best thing for me is to squeeze in little bits of exercise while waiting for something. 'Waiting mode' takes up a lot of my time; I generally find it very hard to juggle tasks, so I can't just reply to that email while waiting for the kettle to boil. But I *can* do 30 bodyweight squats. It requires no commitment—I don't need to get any equipment, and I can stop whenever and I'll still benefit. Pushups are good for the same reason (though my wrists are fucked, so I don't do them very often). Sometimes I'll remember to grab my resistance band before I go to the kitchen, and I can do all kinds of stuff with that while I wait. Other exercise opportunities include:

* Waiting on hold for someone to pick up my call
* Brushing your teeth (this one doesn't work for me because I'm a fucking dribbler, which sucks because brushing your teeth is boring as shit)
* Waiting for the shower water to heat up (depending on how quick this happens at your dwelling)
* Waiting for a large file to download
* While talking on the phone (though maybe don't go too hard; heavy breathing tends to make people uncomfortable)

Finally, I just want to say that, if you just can't find it in yourself to exercise, that's okay. I don't want anyone to feel inadequate after seeing this post. Living with ADHD is hard; be kind to yourself and try not to feel bad if you can't do all the things that people say you *should* do; sometimes you just can't.";;;;
2025-11-07 09:27:44;Do I NEED an adhd diagnosis?;"Im diagnosed with autism. I have a twin brother with severe hyperactive adhd. We are non identical 

I have come to understand I have the inattentive subtype symptoms of adhd that dont necessarily overlap with autism such as a need for variance and excitement INSTEAD of routine. 

I seek dopamine to excess. I'm in opiate recovery. I had B.E.D. Was hypersexual for many years. 

I often draw a blank when I am trying to listen to something or someone speaking. I interrupt because I can already tell what theyre about to say and I finish the sentence impulsely for them to draw it to an end so I dont lose concentration of what theyre saying (bad habit)

My memory is embarrassingly bad and always has been.

In school I never paid attention though I did try very hard. I found that staring at the teacher talking didn't help me understand what was being taught like other kids. Instead I mentally critiqued their outfit and the school work on the walls.

I still to this day don't know which math symbol is more than and which one is less than. But I remember from about 2005 they had ""hungry crocodiles"" on the wall. I permanently memorised the art, not the maths.

I suck at maths lol 

I also learnt to tell the time in high school (uk) at 13 but I still struggle when people say things like ""quarter to""

I confuse June and July. (Both next to each other, 4 letters, starts with J)

Still make an L on my hand when I'm checking what left and right is. 

I'm not dumb though. My IQ is 138 whatever that actually means. I'm an artist. Fascinated by a ridicious unrelated barrage of topics from aeroplanes, birds, computers, gaming, biology, chemistry, ancient history. I could go on for years tbh.

So. I'm pretty darn sure I have both.

  
But

  
Do I actually NEEED to get the adhd officially diagnosed if I already have autism on paper??

The only need I can see for this is medication since they wont give it to autistics but will to adhd

2025-11-07 08:41:25;is it common to struggle with empathy towards other people but not with animals;"(i don't know if this is the right subreddit or tag, or if this counts as a ""struggle"", i apologize if this is not the right ""place"", and for my grammar, this is not my native language)

should i say i was diagnosed as autistic a few years ago, probably not, but...

i think i've had difficulties with this for years, saying things that shouldn't be said that are just downright insensitive and probably rude (realizing it later, sometimes months after [it's probably because of the covid lockdown, but that kinda makes me feel like i'm trying to not put the blame on myself, i don't know])

it's truly strange, seeing a cute tiny animal almost makes me cry from happiness, i cry and get sad when i see one suffering/in pain

but that doesn't happen often with humans, i mean, it's just with specifics groups of people, but with the others, i can't force myself to feel something that is not there

So English is not my native language,  and im struggling to u.derstand what that phrase means.
I have a intense friendship with a male same age as me, not diagnosed but surely im the spectrum. We are friends for ages and had some moments of almost kissimg, or kissing, and almost having sex, we have slept in the same bed countless times. We lost touch for a few years, life basically.
We then moved into differents countries and got married.
We reconnected recently, and have seen each other in two opportunities as we are hust under 3 hours of flight away
First time was very emotional heavy, full of hugs, hand holding, very touchy.And the other one too but with the chat the he does not want to ruin the friendship and cheating  his wife. 
However we were very close to have sex, it did mot happened because i got overwhelmed and was too intense for me

I am now having a massibe crush for him, something tha i never felt before.
I am in the process of separation from my partner, we have struggled for years, and this year i notice how alone i am.

So this guy says that he says that he cares a lot for me, and he does not want to loose contact again. And we had physical affection and lots of talking

Is this love? What level is "" i care a lot of you"" 
Or is it that im lost in translation? English is not his native language either.

Thank you very much

Lately I've been struggling with my memory and focus. I finally got a general assesment where I was told I only have OCD.

2025-11-07 06:54:56;Is an incomplete pie inedible?;"All my life, i felt like i was missing a crucial piece of information that was keeping me from having success at... everything. Like i was a pie no one would buy because there was a piece missing. Then, when it's too late to do anything about it, i find out i actually was missing a critical data point and my entire life of struggling and failure could have been prevented by just one slice of pie.

I really thought the Dx would improve things. I had hope that understanding would make me feel better. But as hope has always been a trap leading to more pain, understanding actually made things worse. 

Every memory is now tainted with the spectre of what might have been. Every action i take is questioned, is this me or the mask or the monster buried within? I've come to dislike my family who acknowledge its existence, but won't change anything to help. I feel awkward talking to the only friend i have left, because i don't have anything to say that is good. Because nothing is.

I hear the sunshine and rainbows stories of the folk who were ""late"" diagnosed in their 20s and it makes me angry. Late? Not so late your entire life was already ruined. Not so late you couldn't take that knowledge and turn things around, find happiness. I can't be the only person that feels like this.

Then again, maybe i am. I was a bitter asshole before the Dx & i'm even more bitter now. Or maybe the bitterness is common. Maybe even the GenZ folk will build up to it in time. Maybe its why so many in our little circle of hell do the unalive thing. An entire life wasted, nothing but poverty & loneliness ahead? You'd better believe i think about it every single day. But i have a senior dog to care for, & nobody can do it but me. The day he passes is going to be an interesting day.😏";;;;
2025-11-07 06:48:01;Vent: I think I only just realized I ruined my entire family's life... (TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide and Topics of War);Don't get me wrong I always knew I was a large source of why my family was in a horrible situation because of me, I just didn't know me and my autism the only cause of it, but now I'm starting to think it definitely. For context I was born in Ukraine and that's where the majority of my family still live there or in Poland, apart from me, my parents and my siblings. We mainly moved to the shithole known as the United Kingdom to get more support for my autism and allegedly because we couldn't afford to live there, which now that I think about is such bullshit, is being poor really an excuse to move into probably one of the worst countries in the west. We might never see our grandparents, great grandparents or cousins again, because of me and my stupid special needs, not to mention I am an absolute pain at home, have severe anger issues which I can't even control and just watch and afterwards do nothing but cry out of guilt and loneliness. I never chose to be like this, life is hard for me and my family, I understand it affects me the most, but along the way I fucked up everything for my parents and my siblings who'll never even learn Ukrainian, might not even see the rest of our family, if I didn't have autism we could've just moved to Poland where the other half of my family lives and where we have lived for about 2 years,  (which seemed like a perfect place to live and honestly is not at war to this day.) before settling in the biggest shithole in my opinion. We can barely afford shit here, yes a bit more in Ukraine or Poland but at the end of the day our family still has to feed my 3 other siblings who we thought were neurotypical (turns out my sister also is autistic, but we weren't able to focus on that because of my autism). My family won't admit I ruined their life and keeps lying to themselves that life is better with me than it would be without, but honestly I wish I was never fucking born, and the guilt along with the mental pain, ptsd and loneliness has caused me to develop severe suicidal thoughts. I have so many cuts on my body I wear a hoodie everywhere I go because without it I feel naked/exposed because of how badly my cuts are visible, and my family had to put up with my suicidal attempts, which multiple of them have trauma over, I keep try and convince my parents they don't know how much how much they'll be better off without me, but I don't think they even realize I have empathy because all the bullshit stereotypes, making us look like sociopathic geniuses, which I'm not, and because of being a complete dumbass I ended up in a special school which caused me severe ptsd due to an incident, which of course made my autism symptoms worse. I don't think I'll ever feel good about having autism, none of you morons I keep seeing in my comments section are gonna change my mind about this shit, my autism actively made mine and my family's lives worse, I wish I never received my diagnosis, it even stops me from joining the frontlines, or even helping move my Ukrainian family to Poland. Now all I do is sit in my fucking room worried they'll all fucking die and nobody here can help, the most I have done is raised money which I donated to people in Ukraine and Palestine to make myself less powerless, but I still feel like I separated my family for good and nobody even wants to admit it. I really don't know what to do anymore. Please tell me someone here has similar experience, is this normal, is my guilt valid and do I not have to treat my stupid autism as a superpower now or feel proud about it??;;;;
2025-11-07 05:00:49;Has anybody here ever experienced an optimal outcome as an autistic person or witnessed it in someone they know?;"Have you ever experienced an optimal outcome as an autistic person, or witnessed it in an autistic person you know? I have been through an optimal outcome, and here’s my story…

I was diagnosed with “classic autism” at 2.5 years of age as I never spoke, never interacted with my family and had no awareness of danger; I also had a limited diet, had no concept of birthdays or Christmas, and was sent to a special school at age 3. Loud noises and the sensory sensation of haircuts upset me. My parents were unsure if I would ever gain functional speech, attend mainstream education or be independent.

I began at the special school at age 3. As far as I know, I received speech therapy, sensory integration therapy and possibly occupational therapy. Through speech therapy, I gained functional speech at age 3, and this became fluent at age 4. However, I gained a thick English accent despite not living in England due to having an obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine.

Eventually, at age 4, I was transferred to a specialist AS provision within a mainstream primary school, after the special school recognised that I had progressed to the point where I could be moved on to a more mainstream environment. While it used techniques such as visual schedules, social stories and a specially fitted sensory room, we would be integrated into mainstream lessons and activities with our neurotypical peers in mainstream, and I believe that this helped massively. Even as I moved into a new SEN provision within the same school at age 9 (after a term in full-time mainstream at the start of Key Stage 2), this mix of partial integration and specialist support continued to benefit me.

At age 11, I began in a specialist learning support centre at a mainstream secondary school. Learning support pupils were integrated into mainstream for Music, Art, Home Economics and TD during Key Stage 3 by default, most of us in the centre were integrated based on strengths (keeping in mind, most of us in the centre were Level 1 autistic, with some having higher levels of disability); I was integrated into mainstream PD and History almost immediately after beginning Key Stage 3; by the time I left Key Stage 3 at age 14, I was integrated into mainstream English, RE and History (PD had been removed from our timetable), and I preferred my mainstream subjects over my learning support subjects as I could have typical experiences and experience a typical classroom setting with my neurotypical peers. I also managed to cut out my thick English accent and replace it with a local one at age 14 for fit in socially. In Key Stage 4, which I began at age 14, I studied for my GCSEs and was mostly integrated into mainstream at this stage, which I was happy about; I did Catering, English, RE, Prince’s Trust and ICT for GCSE. Eventually, I passed all of these and left secondary school.

Now, as an adult, I’m in full time mainstream education. Minor aspects of social interaction are still an issue, although I’m a lot better now than I used to be; I have many friends and I have good relations with them. I do struggle with the likes of anxiety, but to a lesser degree than in the past. I go to the barbers to get my hair cut without issue and I can tolerate loud noises fine. I do my own shopping as well. I aspire to eventually go to university and live completely independently. 

My own parents have acknowledged that they once thought some of my achievements would never happen which is why they value them a lot more than most parents.";;;;
2025-11-07 04:37:32;I used to attribute me taking things literal to reading a lot of fantasy growing up. Did you too?;"Did anyone else grow up believing that their tendency to look very careful at the exact wording of sentences came from reading a lot of fantasy books? Namely, me being used to magical beings (especially fairfolk) not being able to lie (or being able to detect lies) and the exact meaning of prophecies having to be carefully decoded. I thought this had trained me to watch out for exact wordings, whether statements were *technically* a lie or not, and watch for ways the actual truth can be obscured by saying technically true things. And of course take great care with the way I say things. 

Only recently did I understand that I am autistic and that’s just how my brain works. That this is me displaying the classic „takes things literally“ trait without realising for the longest time. 

Did you have similar thoughts/ beliefs that your diagnosis then explained? I would be interested in hearing them :)";;;;
2025-11-07 03:23:48;Starting the process;I’ve been starting the process for an assessment and I have been realising I struggle  quite a lot. I’ve always felt like I was the odd one out but now it feels a lot weirder, I pretty much have spent my whole life not realising how complicated my brain is compared to other people and realising why I felt like the odd one out. Is this a common experience for people who are diagnosed late? ;;;;
2025-11-07 02:30:18;I guess I probably have autism. What now?;"So, as the title says, I probably have autism.  I've always shyd away from it because self diagnosis is bad I know, but here's the thing.  I have some obvious symptoms.  I have family history of it, with my mother, two siblings, and a cousin all having autism.  I've had two doctors of mine tell me that they think I have autism.  The final nail in the coffin leading me to make this post is my girlfriend though.  She has autism, and not long ago I had dinner with her and her parents.  I learned two days ago that after going home after the dinner her parents and her immedietly had a conversation about how they were all really sure I have autism.

I want to find support and learn more about how my mind works so I can improve my life.  I'm 21 living in the United States.  I figure I'm likely much more high functioning autistic, even compared to my girlfriend, but I also have severe ADHD.  What should I do now?  Should I seek diagnosis(and if so how?)?  Where should I look to learn more about autism so I can better understand it?";;;;
2025-11-07 02:01:07;Advice for tolerating the beach, please;"Hello! I'm 30 years old, got diagnosed with autism less than a year ago, which explained a lot of my sensory issues, mainly pertaining to touch-related issues. These past months have been about exploring my tolerance with sensations, as well as discovering and accepting what things I can't tolerate.

So well, It had been around 8 years since I went to the beach so I decided to go again with my parents about a week ago, and this time around I finally accepted that I hate the sensation of humid sand on my feet and ankles. (Also I'm pretty sure the sun pretty much STINGS rather than burns now?? But maybe that's just a global warming thing) So I pretty much stayed in the hotel room and pool and my parents understood.  
I will go to the beach again in december with my parents and brother, and while I know they're understanding I'd like to spend time with them in the beach since it's the part I know they like the most.

So, does anyone have advice for this? Should I get a scuba diving suit or something similar? Do you have any beach advise regarding sensory issues?";;;;
2025-11-07 01:32:43;Feeling as if you are faking it.;"I was recently diagnosed with Level 1 Autism and Combined ADHD and I’m struggling tremendously to identify with the labels and actually believing that the Psychologists were right in their assessments.

I’ve received treatment for reoccurring depressive episodes and anxiety for many years prior to my diagnosis (none of which was helpful)— and I’ve always blamed the AuDHD symptoms on these conditions so finding out their may be another cause is a hard thing to wrap my head around.

I’m a 19 year old female, so this discovery came quite late. I have an older sister (24) who was diagnosed with Level 2 Autism at 10. Perhaps the fact we differ very strongly in our mannerisms is why I struggle to believe the Psychologist was right.

I definitely don’t feel neurotypical, but I don’t exactly feel neurodivergent either. It’s as if I am stuck in a purgatory in the middle— not quite fitting in either communities.

It’s worth noting that my diagnosis process was a very rapid occurrence (I’m tremendously privileged for this). It happened within a space of 6 months after my therapist noted concerns with texture issues in food and referred me for tests. 

I’d love to start unmasking, I feel as if this would significantly help with my co-morbidities. But the first hurdle is truly accepting that AuDHD is something I have in the first place.

Any tips on acceptance? I was wondering whether this is a typical thought process after recent diagnosis? General help and community needed! ";;;;
2025-11-07 01:19:21;Can you be Autistic, while getting better at social skills as you get older?;"Hello! I'd like to start off with that, I am self-diagnosed. When I ask this question, I would like to be clear that I am not asking for a online peer diagnoses, I am just seeking advice on whether to pursue an Autism assessment. (apologies if this came off as rude, I'd just like to clarify and also follow this sub-reddits rules!!)

Now, I am no dummy. I know this is possible, and I don't doubt that this can be a Autistic experience. I think the imposter syndrome hits a little harder when you're experiencing it, so hearing possibly personal experience or advice would be so very helpful.

Recently I have had a couple of instances of were I have had positive social interactions (as in not really awkward and nervous like most time).

(also for reference, I have cleared out that this is not related with any Mental health condition)

I have gotten way better at small talk for example, and while I am so proud of myself. I am starting to question myself now. I learned recently that you are supposed to ask questions also in small talk instead of just answering the questions the other person asks you, while waiting for the next question. I started this technique on Halloween and I would just ask politely ""How is yall's Halloween going so far?"" after I'd say trick or treat. It worked really well actually, and most people would start small talk with that. I was super proud of myself, cause now I know a trick. But oh boy, was I tired the next day. I can't handle social interactions that much, it makes me so exhausted. For reference last year, I was super awkward, and what I believe is part of my masking, I brighten my voice and become really awkward because of my issues with correctly communicating initiation. Initiation is my biggest communication struggle but for reference I would say the same exact thing to everyone after I found it worked on Halloween. It is mildly because of anxiety but, it's mostly because my brain kinda stops, and I actually cannot phrase something even when I feel fine in a emotional status. It's been present since childhood. I have had so many experiences of awkward small talk, and now that I know what to do, it just makes me more exhausted having to do it, and makes me question if I should even pursue a assessment. I do struggle with a lot more, but I understand you have to meet the social criteria so...I'm not sure. 

TLDR: I have gotten significantly better at small talk and initiation (my biggest struggles in socializing). And I was wondering If you would still meet the criteria even with these getting better?";;;;
2025-11-07 00:55:13;Any tips for autistic burnout? How do I bring it up with my employer?;"TW: mention of self harm
Hello! I am a woman in my early 20s, and I am not diagnosed but I definitely have autism, or audhd (I’m in the process of getting a diagnosis for it).

I recently got a job a couple of months ago as a server in a kitchen for a retirement home (I have never worked in a kitchen, only retail), and I am struggling a lot with burnout. It’s a very overstimulating environment, where I am constantly bombarded on all sensory levels (lights, sounds, smell, temperature), and the social environment makes it so I have to mask way more intensely than I’m used to. I feel like I’m an alien trying to fit in with society, and the masking is getting suffocating.

It’s only a 3 hour shift and then a 3 hour break in between, and then another shift, so it’s convenient, and it’s really close to my home. I can’t lose this job as it took me 6 months to find and the job market is shit rn, and I have 2 weddings next year that I want to attend(ones a destination), and I have yet to go to college for the trades I want to do (audio engineering and game design) as I have no money. I have an art side hustle but that is not picking up a ton of traction, and cannot supplement my income. I have no choice but to touch soggy food and get yelled at by old people.

I am irritated and angry all the time, and I can’t even take care of myself other than showering and brushing my teeth. Mustering the energy to go to the bathroom is too much. Doing the things I love is to energy taxing to think about, and I just end up back in my room in my bed lying in the dark with my headphones on and white noise fan because it drowns out all the other little noises because I am avoid a meltdown. I don’t even have the energy to sleep. I find it hard to eat sometimes as well. I’ve never experienced this level of burnout. I have a meltdown every week. It has ended up with me relapsing in sh. It’s the only thing that makes me feel in control (which is so not ok).

Put of the 3 months, I have not come in for 9 days. 5 days was because of a physical injury and I had a doctors note so that doesn’t really count but it is a factor. 

How do I bring this up with my employer? We have psych injury coverage at my work but I don’t know if that falls under that. I’ve tried explaining it to my family and they think I’m just being lazy, so I have no idea how I’m going to bring this up with my boss where they actually are gonna believe me. I have diagnosed anxiety, ocd, and depression as well, do I just blame it on that? I don’t know what to do and I’m really floundering here.";;;;
2025-11-07 00:50:24;My autistic brother thinks I'm autistic, but I'm not;"Hi all,

I'm not sure what the best way to deal with this is. My 40 year old brother has found his autism diagnosis to be extremely fulfilling, affirming, helpful, etc., and I'm really happy he's figured that out for himself. But the problem is that he's been dropping increasingly less subtle hints that I too am autistic for months, and I don't know how to just tell him I'm not.

Listen, I have sensory issues out the whazoo, I always have, so I understand why he thinks that I am autistic. I'm also almost certainly a POTS sufferer. My sister almost certainly is an Ehlers Danlos sufferer. Our dad is undiagnosed autistic and frankly I'd guess my mom is on the spectrum as well (on top of being a raging narcissist/histrionic).

The reason I **don't** think I have autism is as follows:

* I don't find the social/interpersonal symptoms described by autistic folks REMOTELY relatable. 
   * I do not struggle socially, I do not find people confusing or difficult to understand.
   * I find facial expressions VERY easy to read, I don't feel unnatural in almost any social situation, even if I'm in ones I don't enjoy. 
   * I've never once in my life gotten feedback that I come off as rude unintentionally, I can spot subtle conflict dynamics playing out in social situations that people think they're effectively hiding. I have clocked dozens of secret flirtations and fights over the years. 
   * I always know who in the room is the most ""important"" and respected person based on people's deferential vibe.
* I've taken autism online quizzes and I do not score in the autism range. I score slightly higher on ones that inventory sensory issues. 
* I've been seeing my current therapist (a PsyD) for 11 years and he is adamant (like, literally finds it laughable) that I do not have a trace of autism. He has frequently said he thinks I am as far on the **opposite** side of the autism spectrum as I could be.

Reasons I suspect he **thinks** I have autism:

* As mentioned: I have sensory issues. Certain textures absolutely freak me out. Can't wear itchy wool sweaters or touch them. I have extremely sensitive, rash-prone skin. I have allergies. I have POTS (probably). I'm extremely ticklish and pain sensitive.
* I am not extremely conflict avoidant. I call people out that other people won't, and have steadily become totally intolerant of people being rude to me. But it's never an accident. It always takes a LOT of emotional build up and courage and formulating what I'm going to say. It's not abrupt, sudden, or unintentional. I think about conflict very carefully and then choose what's worth it and what's not. I'm braver than, like, most people i know about engaging in what I consider necessary conflict.
* Some CPTSD symptoms: chronic pain, gastrointestinal issues (I can't eat dairy at all, but if i don't my tummy problems are actually fine), and historically: poor emotional regulation (but i've been steadily improving this over time.

It's worth noting that he also thinks our shared nephew is autistic, but my sister has brought him to professionals (because her partner is also diagnosed autistic), and the professionals did not think he was autistic. He also has sensory (particularly sound) and tummy issues though. But, just like me, he has none of the social stuff. 

So, my questions:

**First:** Is it possible to be autistic with none of the social issues?

**Second:** Are there other explanations for sensory issues that anyone knows of?

**Third:** How do I convince him I'm not autistic? I don't want him to think I'm offended, because I don't think autism is bad, I love my autistic friends, and him, but it does make me feel poorly understood by him when he misattributes things to autism that I think are... something else! I don't know what! I'm also worried that if I over-explain, or appear defiant, he's gonna clock it as autism and feel more confident he's correct.

**Fourth**: Is it worth correcting him? Currently i just dodge any mention he makes where he's implying I'm autistic, or just don't respond, or don't respond to that comment directly. But he brings it up almost every time we talk, which is very often, so I'm not sure how sustainable it is.";;;;
2025-11-07 00:44:46;Community Consultation needed to review statements about Autism and EUPD/BPD;"**About the research**

* **Who am i?** My name is Laura and I am a Trainee Clinical Psychologist carrying out some doctoral research at the **University of Staffordshire.**
* **What am I researching: My research is in two phases.** For the main study I am exploring the similarities, differences, and intersection between Autism and EUPD/BPD in professionals working in NHS, Private and 3rd Sector teams. The main goal of this research is to reduce misdiagnosis (especially where Autism is missed) and develop recommendations for NHS services. 
* **Task i need consultation on:** I need support in reviewing a set of statements (collected from lived experiences on blog, social media and journals) and help select the ones **most reflective** of community thoughts and feelings about the diagnostic journey. 
* **Time:** If you choose to review the statements over email, this can be done at your own pace and we will discuss a suitable time to turn this around. If you want to look over a selection of the statements online, we can do this on Zoom (1 hour). 
* **Consultation phase:** It is estimated that the consultation phase will be open for 3 weeks starting from the 24th November 2025.

  
**Eligibility** 

* **Diagnostic status:** This is open to anyone who has a diagnosis of Autism and/or EUPD, self-identifies as Autistic, or no formal diagnosis in place but is on diagnostic pathways. 
* **Knowledge:** You do not need a dual diagnosis to share your opinions, but it is helpful to know about EUPD/BPD.
* **Demographics:** I welcome all age ranges (from 18+), gender identities, sexualities, and racial/ethnic backgrounds-please do not self-exclude based on these factors.

**Proof of Ethics & benefits**

* **Approvals:** NHS REC: 25/SW/0089 (Cornwall and Plymouth) AND University of Staffordshire (SU\_24\_064).
* **Funding:** This research is not being funded
* **Feedback:** The executive summary will be posted after the study is completed.
* **Benefits:** There is an opportunity to be acknowledged in the report and provide a reflective summary about the impact of this research/consultation experience.

2025-11-07 00:13:06;I NEED AN ADVICE……….;"hey. i don’t really do self-diagnosing, but i do need to share this and hear out your opinion, because im totally lost. 
so, the story goes: i’ve always been the weird kid at school/uni. the kid that avoids certain textures and foods, the kid who had a panic attack during a fire drill. the usual. 
earlier in my life i’ve been diagnosed with ADHD (which i’m not sure i have anymore). 
the main problem is that i suspect that i might have ASD, but i live in a country that’s not so…autistic/adhd-friendly as other western countries. (the term ‘autistic’ is still used as a slur and most people have little to no idea what ASD or any neurodiversity is).
i experience similar symptoms to ASD (sensitivity overload, texture avoidance, stimming etc.), but all this time i though it was due to my ADHD. 
i can’t really call in for a therapist/psychiatric appointment, because im afraid that once i actually get diagnosed, i wont be able to work properly (im a lawyer and in my country the medical records are open to employers). 
!so im here to ask for any sort of advice! i might be overthinking it, but i might not…and thats the problem im experiencing rn.

2025-11-07 00:02:47;Feeling uncertain about a psych evaluation;"In the past several months, I went through a psychological evaluation with a very well-reviewed and recommended Neuropsychologist in my local area. The main reason I selected them was based on reviews saying they were very good at seeing through long-term coping and/or masking behaviors people aren't even aware of (I am in my 40s so if I have anything I likely have just learned to adapt to it). This was done wholly out-of-pocket and a fairly significant expense, though it is affordable for me.

My interaction with this psychologist has consisted of:

* 1 hour long initial screening phone call where she took some notes and generally talked with me about the evaluation process.
* Several self-examinations I completed online over the course of the week, specifically the Gillian Autism Rating Scale (GARS-3), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III), Brown Executive Functioning/Attention Scales (Brown EF/A), and Delis Rating of Executive Functions (D-REF) 
* A follow-up video call that was about an hour long and discussed some more general issues and initial thoughts of results. 

The psychologist then sent me a long report (60 pages) going over my results, outcomes, and other estimations about psychological. Some observations felt very astute to me, while others felt quite far from the mark personally. The conclusion is that in their opinion, I meet the diagnosis criteria for ADHD, Level 1 Autism, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Personally, I came into this feeling/suspecting my main issue is ADHD. I don't feel like I'm a particularly anxious person, nor was I really expecting anything about autism. I have mixed feelings about the conclusions, and I think the main thing is that I have a hard time feeling confidence about them because I feel like I didn't spend much time with the psychiatrist, and all of it was remote.

I'm a layperson and don't know much about these tests, but I presume they are all well-regarded field standards. Still, they rely completely on the person reporting (me), being sure about their answers, and I'm frankly *not* sure if I'm ever being completely accurate when I answer these questions or if it's just ""in my head"". I have a similar problem with quantifying more abstract medical questions (does my leg really hurt, or does it just kind of hurt? Maybe I have a higher pain tolerance than others, or a tendency to minimize my own feeling of discomfort?).

I guess in my head, a ""real"" diagnosis would be achieved by multiple sustained sessions of observations of my physical behavior and mannerisms by a professional with probing questions about my past and general feelings, perhaps even accompanied by neurological scans to get something really objective. I find myself struggling to believe an accurate assessment can be achieved with what I have done so far.

I have another follow-up meeting where I plan to go over this with the psychologist, but I thought I would post about my experience here and see if I could get any input from other people who have gone through similar evaluations and get some more perspectives.";;;;
2025-11-06 23:59:02;Nothing feels fun anymore, I just want to be happy.;"I don't know If this is the right tag or post. I'm sorry if that's the case.

I'm a fourteen year old girl. I have autism, ADHD, anxiety and depression, all diagnosed. I also meet the diagnostic criteria for bpd according to my doctor, but I'm not old enough to get diagnosed. I'm on fluoxetine and some other adhd medicine, and I still have depression and moodswings.

I managed to stop self harming, I go to a school that's a little bit better for neurodivergent students, my mama is doing better and is in therapy too, I don't argue with my family regularly anymore. I should be happy, I want to be happy, I want to have a normal childhood. I want to be a normal kid. But my depression just won't leave.

I don't understand all these tips and tricks that work for people around me. Why would journaling help me? I've been writing down how I feel since I heard it the first time and I don't feel anything. Now I just have a bunch of water damaged diaries I wasted paper on, with nothing but my shitty handwriting and tears.

People tell me to sleep more, eat more, exercise more, but no matter how much or how long i do those things for it never leaves. I feel like im not real. It can't be burnout, I've learned so many things about myself and how much i can take, it would have been over by now.

I am tired of being told to practice mindfulness. I am tired of cheap surface level crap my therapists say. I just want to be happy. I want to be okay. I don't want to have anxiety, i dont want to dissociate.

I don't feel joy in drawing, or singing, or indulging in my special interests anymore. My mama asks me where her little kid has gone, and it's killing me from the inside. She sends me pictures of the little girl i once was, where i was smiling brightly and leaning against her. Sticking out my tounge, always spunky and cheery no matter what had happened.

I want to be a better daughter. I hear her cry at night sometimes, I see a glimpse of Facebook threads on childhood depression on her phone. I don't want to put her through this. I don't want to keep her up at night when I have breakdowns, I don't want to make her miss work.

I should be happy. I want to be happy. I want to have a special interest. I want to have a hobby. I want to be happy. I feel completely alienated. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a lost cause.

When i get overstimulated i get mean and angry and defensive and I hurt others feelings. I am not mean. I do not want to be mean. When i apologise to my mama she tells me it's not my fault and that it's okay, but she's sad. Its not okay. But my mind takes over. All i can think is that she wants to hurt me, that she'll turn cold and abandon me the second i let her in again. And then a bit later i can see how irrational that is.

I want to curl up and dissappear. Why cant I be happy? I want to be like all the other girls. I want to be happy, i don't want to have autism or adhd.

The only time i genuinely feel content or happy is when I'm writing my stupid fanfiction at night. It's idiotic. I write myself into my fandoms and pretend I'm some characters kid. Why is that the thing that brings me an ounce of joy? I want to be happy again.

Please tell me if you know anything that could help me. Please.";;;;
2025-11-06 23:17:46;Odd question. Is the increase or perceived increase in autism rates due to the fact we don't hide special needs children as much or blatantly just abandon the weird kids in the woods?;"I know majority of the increased diagnosis depending on what you're looking at is going to be the fact that they changed autism to a spectrum.  

But a thought ran across my head that maybe we're just seeing more kids with autism because we don't socially kill them anymore..... As fucking horrible as the past is";;;;
2025-11-06 22:49:35;What if I'm just a loser;"I can't be diagnosed because I don't have anyone that will corroborate my childhood experiences. My clinical psychologist said I do display a lot of issues and symptoms to autism, but because of the local guidelines, she does not advise going for a diagnosis as the result would likely be inconclusive.


It tears me up a little bit. I'm still worried I'm being lazy and could be neurotupical if I wanted to. I could go back to school and juggle work and school. I could clean my room and make myself more socially acceptable and more presentable and get someone to love me for once and not put off my laundry and naturally do eye contact and not have to manually have conversations and be able to stand the smell of air fresheners and the sound of styrofoam boxes squeaking.


Maybe I'm just faking all that and being lazy because I can't actually be bothered to try for my goals in life. Goal. I just want to be loved by someone.";;;;
2025-11-06 22:47:33;Just a little vent;Hello. I am 29 and am diagnosed with Autism. On top of that im also diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar 1 with psychosis. I have a good job and a car. At this moment, Trumps Flagship AI facility is being build in my city. Because of this I've been homeless and off my meds for going over 3 months now. I just wanted to know if anyone has dealt with this kind of situation and if anyone has any advice? Im starting to hallucinate again and I can only hold onto reality for so long without my meds.;;;;
2025-11-06 22:42:48;i want to stop being too rigid;"hi :)

i'm almost 30 now, diagnosed autistic many years ago. i kinda got a big realization that i'm not getting any younger, my parents aren't getting any younger. and this is the only time i can have with people i love.

i have been avoiding doing anything risky, anything too out of my comfortzone, because well, i get very very upset when things don't go my way, or there's a little change happen in my schedule, so that means i also have been avoiding spending quality time with loved ones.  
  
*and I KNOW ''spending time with loved ones'' doesn't have to be anything that i Don't Want to do. that my loved ones can do my autistic things instead of me having to do their allistic things. but i'm saying like, things that i Do want to do, just too disgusted by the fact that it takes me OFF of my schedule. (annnywway)* 

and it's like on one hand, i get it, being autistic has its awesomeness and positive side, on the other hand, i fucking hate it. i just let pretty much half of my life just slip away because aaahhh change scary!!!! 

these past couple of months, i have been working on just letting things be, everything will fall into its place without me forcing it there. i have less disappointment and rage when things don't go according to plan because i try not to have an expectations on any outcome. or even plan at all. i try to say yes to every invitations (though failed to go to a wedding last week), and it can be very tiring and i get overwhelmed and crazy headaches due to sensory overload. but hmm. i feel satisfied anyway knowing that i have lived that, those big little experiences. even when it was just to get a coffee with mom at the cafe (i usually just order a delivery service)

  
**and this post isn't me saying that every autistics have to do what i do**. i guess i just wanted to share something positive. change IS scary, maybe i no longer see it as ''everything is ruined'' scary and more of a ''roller coaster'' scary. 

  
i hate having anxiety, i hate being depressed as shit my whole life. i hate wanting to control my life so much. autism is both a curse and a superpower to me. i want to ''fuck it, we ball'', i want to ''chill'' and ''let it go''. and i'm working on that now! it may take me nearly 30 years to finally work on that (haha no therapy gang).

it will hurt, it will be exhausting, but i want to go to sleep in the future knowing that i have done something new that day.

literally nothing else about my autism that i hate other than RIGIDITY. 

yeah, i want to spend my entire life taking care of my isopods and watching springtails. but i ALSO want to follow my loved ones to their favourite places before one of us dies. and traveling fucking hurts nothing is worth it, but i now want to be there anyway. (i think they called it YOLO.)

  
*i want to do naughty things like ignore my schedule sometimes (holy shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!)* 

i still do have pangs of anxiety when my rigidity is challenged. but idk, we'll see where this goes ?

my what to do's : 

\-remove ''outcomes'' from brain   
\-fuck it and ball  
\-remind self that things will fall where they're supposed to without me forcing it  
\-find the good in things always  
\-say good morning to people 

  
the difference between ''is this it?'' (disappointment) and ''is this it?!'' (excitement) when watching shit happens. 

  
anyway, live life. smile. keep going, let go. love u all. ";;;;
2025-11-06 21:55:55;My life’s ultimatum: Either move out or off myself.;Hi. I’m a 33 yo autistic man(formerly diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome). I had a meltdown at home today. I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital twice in the past. My mom does what she does best again: crying, guilt tripping, Asian style, blaming me for her having cancer in the past, along with everything else. She even gave me permission to off myself and said she won’t stop me from doing it. My parents are also from fairly abusive families. I’m currently unemployed and broke. I wanna move out asap but don’t know where to go in the world. I’m totally lost and tired of suffering anymore.;;;;
2025-11-06 21:55:37;Looking for recommendations on books/info for senior parents;"Hi all, sorry for the vague title lol my entire question did not fit.

I am a newly diagnosed adult and I am looking for recommendations for books, videos, anything really to help my older parents understand autism a bit better. They accept the diagnosis, it's not a ""you can't be autistic!"" sorta thing, but I think there is still some stigma within them about what autism really is. If possible, I'd prefer it to be about late-diagnosed autism in particular, and something more education than anything else. My mother in particular is having a hard time comprehending why I am ""suddenly *so* autistic when [i] wasn't before"", and it's hard trying to explain to her what's going on. I know it doesn't necessarily make a difference, but if there is anything on late-diagnosed **female** then that would be great too.

I hope this makes sense. Thank you in advance for any help, and please ask any questions for clarity if needed.";;;;
2025-11-06 21:44:01;Really struggling to cope during inpatient med washout and need advice;"Wasnt sure where the best place to ask this, but I’m really hoping someone has advice. I’m currently in a private inpatient hospital for a planned med washout. Most of my meds were prescribed before my ASD diagnosis, and my psychiatrist and psychologist thought it would help to get back to a baseline and see what actually makes a difference.

I agreed to do it inpatient because I know withdrawal can be hard, but I honestly don’t know if I can stay, and it’s only my first niht. Every time I become aware of where I am, my heart races, I start crying, and it feels like I’m on the edge of shutdown. I just want to feel safe again.

Has anyone else gone through a med washout? Did you do it inpatient or at home with support? I could have done it at home with family, but I went with my psychiatrist’s recommendation for inpatient. Right now, though, I don’t know if I can make it through another day, let alone several weeks.

I’d really appreciate hearing from others who’ve been through this, whether it was manageable at home. I want to make the right choice, but I’m honestly not coping, and I don’t know how the withdrawal symptoms could be worse than this feeling. Any advice would be so appreciated. ";;;;
2025-11-06 21:31:17;AuDHD and preparing meals. Are there programs to help?;"I have a hard time with cooking. I can cook, but my body for some reason just can’t initiate it sometimes. I rely on simple foods because it’s easier. Ever since I moved out of my parent’s house, I’ve been struggling with this. My question is, are there programs out there that assist people with autism in the US that provide prepared meals? 


It’s really hard to understand why I’m like this. I’m a newly diagnosed highly masking adult female with lvl1 autism. I’m fully capable of cooking. I can cook when I feel like it, but it’s like I’m just lazy in a way. Which I know is not the right wording because I know it’s much more than being lazy. It’s just hard to explain. ";;;;
2025-11-06 20:07:52;Textual shutdown similar to verbal shutdown;Sometimes I find it hard to put my thoughts into words at all, through written word or typing or speaking. I've had verbal shutdowns where writing or typing is still ok, but often there's an amount of difficulty. I'm not diagnosed but I'm fairly sure I'm autistic and I have a lot of evidence to back it up. Does this seem related?;;;;
2025-11-06 19:59:18;Whirlwind of emotions while designing life;"So for the past 4 I've been working on an AI system that aids in mental health for people who don't have access to it. Slippery slope, I know. 

When I was a child of single digits, I remember telling my mother that AGI would be a thing by the time I was grown. She didn't fully understand, but she knew that I could see the ""gears and pulleys,"" so to speak.

I'm not really a coder(I've modded the weirded things just for my internet boy gamer pleasure lol), but I've always been able to figure out workarounds within the realm of tech.

Anyway, back to my thing..

I've been wanting to continue my work on it, ajen ven release it as an offline standalone handheld, but imlve all but chucked that idea outta the window. Investors don't just waltz up to you like in the movies, and innovative hunger can sometimes throw them off.

So I decided to make my AI programs into modules that I can sell to try to create a new stream of income...

Executive dysfunctions at so many points.

Like, I've been in high chaos situations that my system has helped me get through, life through, work through and even suffer through, while remembering how to maintain myself with my two/3 primary diagnosis (autism cptsd ADHD).

But getting to the point where I wanna sell it?
I always feel pain.

Giving it away feels easier, but I'm also a 30 yo man with no trampoline to fall back on, and two cents in my savings, so that makes me look at life a bit cock-eyed, frankly ,😅

I guess this was a bit of a piecemeal info dump rant, but I'm doing incredible things in my life with little support and no safety net, so maybe I should just be proud at that itself, but then there's a hunger for like... Recognition... I guess like to be recognized in a positive light, as opposed to the demonization that(IMHO) seems soooo much easier for people to spread around...

Okay rant thing over. If anyone wants to chat or anything, hit meh up. Let's get loopy 🤪

I'm also an artist and musician.";;;;
2025-11-06 17:52:34;Late diagnosed (at 37), struggling to accept the diagnosis and the reactions of those around me;"I'm 37, and I was diagnosed with Asperger's two years ago. You'd think everything would fall into place, but I still can't come to terms with it or accept it.

The hardest realization is that all the pain, humiliation, misunderstanding, criticism, and mockery in my life happened not because I was ""somehow broken and need to be fixed,"" but because society doesn't know how to communicate with someone like me. I feel both relief and incredible pain at the same time.

When it dawned on me that my entire life I had done nothing but adjust to others, copied their behavior, and repeated their words just to be accepted, and that all of it was useless and even harmful... I lost myself in those attempts. Thinking about this often brings me to tears, and I don't know what to do about it. Since school, I've been reading psychology books to understand people's behavior. To others, it looked like an interesting hobby; for me, it was a survival strategy!

Here's what else complicates the situation:

* **Social ""Success"":** I'm relatively successful in my field (though I remain in an individual contributor role, which suits me). But in my company (and in the country where I live now), Asperger's doesn't exist. People here think those on the spectrum are either lazy people trying to get benefits by jumping on a trend, or simply stupid people who don't want to admit their stupidity.
* **Rejection of the Diagnosis:** When people learn about my diagnosis, they start arguing that I don't have it! Or they say, ""We're all a little bit on the spectrum."" My former psychologist, whom I saw for over 6 years, claimed that Asperger's is a fictional diagnosis designed to extract money from people.
* **Family:** My wife and family don't want to accept it. My wife even brought up the idea of divorce because she ""suffered"" because of me. She used to like my logicality and that I don't kowtow to social norms, but now she's learned that these are traits of autism, not my conscious decision to be that way. She thought I was brave, but it turned out I was just good at masking, which makes me a coward.
* **Shutdowns:** I've only had 5 major shutdowns in my entire life. The hardest one happened when I was 19: I woke up and couldn't speak, couldn't understand speech, all my movements were very slow. I could only repeat words after others. Back then, they misdiagnosed me with hysteria and panic attacks. Now I've learned to see the warning signs and mitigate them.

Now I live in a world where, for those around me, my Asperger's doesn't exist. A world that expects me to mask, but I don't want to mask anymore. I just want to be myself. I want to have the possibility of not understanding others, but also the possibility to ask my interlocutor what they specifically meant. I want people to realize that perceptions are different, and if I say something wrong, they can clarify what I meant or tell me how my words made them feel.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this off my chest. I hope my story helps someone understand that they are not alone.

Wishing everyone peace and a good day.";;;;

2025-11-06 17:06:57;Studying is a grey area;"Idk which flair is best so please correct me if I'm wrong  
  
Every time I (14M) try to study I either can or can't. I can study stuff which interests me more fine (English, Computer Class.. the list does not go on much) but as soon as I try and grab something else (Biology to an extent (I can study it but some parts just don't like me.. phases of cell mitosis), History, Geography) I need to sit with my mom and she has to spoonfeed Asia to me.

I don't have any official diagnosis or whatever it's called but I took probably 6 online (""autism"") tests in the last few months and my lowest score was a 7 out of 10 (most were around 8.4).

My mom left me home alone to study biology (she had work and she always leaves me in the early morning) but I just couldn't. I read and read and read and memorized but as soon as I closed my book I forgot everything. Instead I practiced piano because I had an assignment from there (not exactly an assignment but it's the closest word, Biology was a test in 24 days) and did my homework from other subjects. When she got back home she yelled at me and took my phone. When I started crying she just grabbed me by my head and said ""no no no please don't cry!!"" in some weird yelling-worried voice (passive aggressive? idk if it even MEANS the same but thats what I thought of).

Probably not related but I'm ranting - my brother took some random board I needed and I told him to put it down. He said no tauntingly and wanted to hit me with it (he's 9). I said I'd throw a bag of nickels at him (a bag of metal more correctly). He, again, said no. I threw it pretty lightly ngl and my dad yelled at me in my room. When I started crying (yes I'm emotional I cry at sitcoms) he just yelled ""stop crying"" and a few minutes later ""I'll open the window so everyone can hear you"" (empty threat). I even tried to be quiet and I really was but nonetheless. Also I was kinda crying because it was my birthday and even the promised gifts which were pretty small I didn't even get so I was crying because of that too.

So I suppose I need to tell my parents I'm probably autistic or something. Knowing them they'll probably say I'm lying and give me threats to ""take me to the hospital and give me a test"". Ngl I wouldn't even mind if that's what takes to prove to them that I'm autistic or whatever. However the big worry part is in telling them in the first place, does anyone have tips?";;;;
2025-11-06 16:23:28;I feel robotic with my emotions;"Hello, I was recently diagnosed after a 3 year long battle with different specialists, and yes it is helping me get closure on this and finally understand why I act the way I do, however there is still this weird feeling about my emotions.

I just cannot understand it, there will be days where I will wake up and feel a void in my chest, where I will be anxious and very emotional, crying if someone looks at me the wrong way. But there will also be days where I will feel like I can carry the world on my shoulders, that if I want I can move mountains with my bare hands.

I just cannot understand this, I can understand other peoples emotions but I have no idea about my own, I feel like a machine who is trying to understand something it wasn’t programmed for.

If anyone is reading this, do you also feel or felt this way ? ";;;;
2025-11-06 15:05:43;Just got Diagnosed;"So I'm a 22 year old non-binary and just got diagnosed with autism. I was socialised as a girl, so no one even questioned that I might be on the spectrum.
Do you guys have any advice how I could start a conversation with my parents about what autism even is? My male cousin got his ADHD diagnosis when he was just a little kid, but I don't know how much knowledge my parents have about any of those topics. Any help is appreciated ";;;;
2025-11-06 14:22:50;I may not ever get diagnosed, how can I live?;"
In the past year, I've decided to try to take care of my mental health again, and I began by going to a psychologist.
During our first session, she spoke to me for about 15 minutes and asked, ""Have you ever considered you may be autistic?"". I have been going to different therapists since I was 9 and this was the only time that had ever been brought up, not only is my psychologist specialized in treating autism, but this was also the first time I felt safe and truly opened up.
After that, my sessions with her were purely focused on that. After three months, she was sure I was an undiagnosed autistic woman, and that I should look for a more in-depth treatment.
The problem is, I can't afford it. I was barely able to afford her sessions, and going to a psychiatrist or a neurologist and doing all those tests needed for a proper diagnosis is something I could never ever do, considering my and my parents' financial situation.

And it's so so upsetting, because after 20 years of being unsure of myself, I've finally been given an explanation, a way to understand and heal myself. But it all feels fake, forced, and insincere because I don't have a diagnosis.

I don't want to be seen as a quirky neurospicy girl, I don't want to treat people like shit and then blame it on being autistic, I don't care for cutting lines at the supermarket or any ""benefits"" people believe autistic people have. I want to understand my hurt so I can heal it and be able to live a proper life, and if that can only happen through a diagnosis, then how am I supposed to live?

I have the ""symptoms"", I've sought professional help, I struggle and I suffer, I am berated and misunderstood for all the things that always circle back to being autistic. But I can't say that, when I have a mental breakdown, I can't say that it's because I'm autistic, so I just have to accept that maybe I'm just born wrong.

I can't form relationships, I don't go out much, I dropped out of school at 13, and I don't have a job, but because of that piece of paper, all those things happened because I'm not normal, not like everybody else, crazy or weird, every word used to berate an autistic person BUT actually autistic.

I worked half this year as a nanny, earning a shit amount of money while wrecking myself mentally to the point where I constantly went non-verbal, had melt-downs every weekend, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, and just an overall shut down. Because I was ignoring all the ""symptoms"" so I could be a normal adult and get a normal job and earn some money.
In the end, I got so bad that I had to quit. 

It's like a cursed cycle. I can't work because of my symptoms, but I can't blame my suffering on my symptoms because I'm not diagnosed, so I'll work to be able to afford a diagnosis...But I can't work because of my symptoms....

How can I grow? How can I live? How can I form relationships? How am I supposed to work so I can afford my diagnosis?

Am I supposed to just accept that I'm not right, and just live my days waiting for death? because how will I be able to live a normal life like everybody else, when everybody's ""normal"" is incredibly harmful to me?

should I force myself to dance their dance until I'm too tired to the point of giving up on everything? should I drag myself trough life?
Will I have to watch everybody around me improve and proudly exist while I sit in shame for not knowing what or who I am?

I wish that I could say ""hey, I can't stand in a crowd for more than 20 minutes because I'm autistic"" but I can't. If I say ""mom, this is happening because I'm autistic"" it's fake, it's a terrible thing for me to say because I don't have a diagnosis, but I still deal with the issues!

 How can I live beyond my diagnosis if said diagnosis is the main reason why I can't live?

 I feel guilty, guilty for feeling relief when I was given an explanation, guilty for relating to everyone in this community, and guilty for being so sure of who I am, because I don't feel like I'm allowed to.

As long as I don't have that diagnosis, I feel like I'm not allowed to name the struggle and the suffering I go through, like I am faking something that I clearly feel, sometimes I feel like I'm faking, but the I look at that wounded child I was and can't comprehend why would she fake being something that only brought her harm.

I'm not sure why I'm writing or posting this, It's just that the year is ending soon and the realization that nothing has changed for me it's kinda eating me away, knowing that this community is the only place I've found comfort in while still feeling like I'm a fake, like I shouldn't even be here.

I just want to have the tools to live in peace with myself and my ""quirks"", but there's no way to do it without the word ""autism"" coming out of my mouth, and that itself feels like a sin.";;;;
2025-11-06 14:01:11;Started dating someone I really like, but my social anxiety is through the roof now.;"Hey everyone! I am 23M almost 24, diagnosed with level one autism (PDD-NOS to be more specific) and I have recently started talking to a really nice girl 21F who I met through friends of friends. We’ve been talking for about a month now and things seem to be going very well. We have both expressed that we like each other but we agreed to take things slow which seems to be working well because that is something I used to struggle with when I was younger. Recently, because of this new relationship, my social anxiety has gone through the roof and I keep second guessing everything I say or do. I’m trying so hard to not seek reassurance (thanks OCD smh) but that can be a challenge. Recently, she’s been going through teachers college and has been dealing with lots of stress which she handles stress differently than I do. I am an extrovert and when I talk to people, it helps me as a form of distraction, but for her, she prefers to be alone and doesn’t want help for her stressors. I’m having an extremely hard time with this because I always think she’s mad at me even though she isn’t and has told me that. I’ve been trying my best to set my own boundaries and accept her boundaries which I am doing an ok job at, but I can improve for sure. 

On top of that, I have been working a lot while managing the new relationship. I’ve been working 42.5-44 hours a week so I think just being overtired may be contributing to the stress too.

Any advice is welcome and I greatly appreciate it!";;;;
2025-11-06 13:04:41;Are you public with your autism/aspergers or not?;"I'm a 20M and I was diagnosed at around 7 with aspergers. For pretty much my whole life I've known I have had aspergers but I haven't told anyone. The only people who know are my immediate family. My mother has said that I'm ""normal"" now as in my symptoms aren't as obvious but I think she is a bit biased and I have been told I come off as shy or a bit awkward by her and other people. I've been asked a couple of times by people if I'm autistic or something, but I lie and say no for the sake of convenience; I also lie in job interviews when they ask that.

I don't know if its healthy or normal to do that, but I do it for the sake of social convenience, opportunity, and I also want to be treated the same as others. I was wondering if other people with aspergers hide it like I do or not?";;;;
2025-11-06 13:00:14;In high school, just discovered this sub and realized I share a ton in common with what you all describe dealing with. Never been diagnosed with anything, so wondering if these sound familiar?;"1. Finding conversation physically exhausting/intimidating, but mainly when the situation has not been set up for you by an external event or factor
2. Finding conversation physically exhausting/intimidating, but when you are forced to make small talk you end up talking WAY TOO MUCH
3. Never adopted slang or cursing even when all your peers did (maybe that's just me)
4. If you are forced to stay in school or at work after your leaving time, you feel awful, like time is slipping away and leaving you in some cold and unfamiliar world even though everything is the same (and it is next to impossible to force yourself to go to school events or parties not during your routine ""outside/social"" hours)
5. Sensitivity to noise (that may or may not hinder sleep)
6. Sensitivity to many foods, not necessarily because of allergy, but because of texture and flavor (ARFID?)
7. Feeling like you have the social skills of a 4th grader with the self-consciousness (knowing you aren't doing/saying the right thing, you just don't know what) of someone your real age
8. Feeling like even if you had friends who shared your interests/obsessions, you wouldn't know what to do with them (""hanging out"" or constructing plans to do something together isn't even appealing, as much as the basic idea of a childhood-type friendship is wanted)
9. Afraid of making people angry, and if you do, you vividly remember the exact interaction over and over again for literal years, long after they've forgotten
10. Having one or two close friends that you can actually be with normally, making you temporarily forget why you can't just have more friends (doubting that something is really wrong, that maybe you just want to be ""special"" or something)

P. S.: Can people stop asking me the question ""what''s up"", because I never have any idea what to say when someone asks me that. I can't just say ""good"", which I programmed myself to say for other questions like ""how are you"", and by the time I think of what to explain all hopes of having a natural conversation are lost.

2025-11-06 12:19:07;rejection??;hi i’m not like diagnosed as neurodivergent but i can relate a lot to this subreddit. im 16, a student that should have extracurriculars and a social life because theyre about to graduate. i dont have any of that bc its exhausting i feel like im not likeable, like ive got the opposite of of charisma. i have bad vibes, maybe i appear to be cold even when i try my hardest not to. i just got rejected from an interview today so im wondering if ill ever be accepted into anything. i mean it was just a school club exec role but i literally had such a big chance of getting in bc no one applied 💀 anyways ive never been accepted into anything that requires an interview. like i say the right things but sometimes off about me, most of the times they say im quiet but i was louder this time and still got rejected? i even tried to do it unscripted and still got rejected. ive only done school interviews so its not that big of a deal but im scared like how will i ever get a job or something? i know people who came late, said whatever, got accepted. i applied to something bc my friend said they accept everyone AND STILL GOT REJECTED??? i even heard an exec mention how good my application was and it stood out and still got rejected after the interview. my friend (i encouraged her to apply) got in when she is less qualified but has better people skills. how will i make it anywhere in life???;;;;
2025-11-06 11:33:44;kinda mad right now - read my old evaluation for the first time;"(tw: I mention a bit some difficult family relations and events that are a part of my past trauma)

I'm sorry again for posting so often I don't mean to. Things just keep happening and my husband is dealing with his own stuff so I literally have no one to talk to about any of this. 

  
Since I am trying to get evaluated again I thought I would try to find my old evaluation to show during my next evaluation. So I read the evaluation I got when i was 15 or 16 for the first time today and it is verrryyyy upsetting. I can't believe some of it. Normally i would just suck it up and bury my emotions or try to focus on something else, but I am really trying to not feel so terrible all the time so I thought I'd post it here for maybe some support. But  I understand if I've been posting too much I don't want to overwhelm this thread just let me know. 

Basically I already knew that I was trying very hard to be ""normal"" for this evaluation and that females have a harder time being diagnosed sometimes and I've had suspicions for years so I might as well put the matter at rest and get another evaluation. Also the fact that my therapist at the time who I had been seeing for at least a year from when I was 15 was certain that I was on the spectrum, she even said that there may have some mistake with the evaluation. Funnily enough, she never saw the full report from the evaluation because my dad was careless and copied it to her wrong - so she could only see every other page of the evaluation - and he never fixed it for her, from what I can remember at least. 

  
Basically I didn't have good relations with either of my parents at the time, and they seemed to rely mostly on the parent questionnaires in their decision. In the beginning report they say that my school noted that I did good academically but that I didn't have any friends (that hurts). It's stated that my dad noted that I had poor social skills, poor eye contact, did not pick up on social cues, had no friends, high anxiety, and a flat affect, and will not engage socially unless spoken to first.  

So I had all that going on, but because my mom, dad, and a teacher's questionnaires  noted that I was ""generally average"" I didn't get diagnosed. For the record, I'm pretty sure this questionnaire came about a year after my mom lost custody of my siblings and I following a long court battle. She was not in a good frame of mind, and at the time I did not like being close to her at all. I don't think we were seeing her much at all. The fact that she was able to play such a big part in this evaluation, is unbelievable to me. They didn't ask my therapist, who I had been seeing for at least a year, anything, but they asked the mother who had literally lost custody because of seriously ill mental health. 

As for the teacher, I literally gave the teacher questionnaire (they for some reason let me pick which teacher to give it to) to a substitute math teacher that my class only had for like 6 months or a year, while my school tried to fill the teaching position. I pretty much never talked during her class or any class, except I remember that we had one group project that year where we were put in pairs of two, and I tried really hard to do good and act normal during that project. It lasted a week I think. I barely knew that teacher, and I don't think she could have known me at all. I literally gave the questionnaire to her because I was super super mortified about any of my ""real"" teachers knowing that I was getting evaluated... again I wanted to be as normal as possible. 

My dad did also fill out a questionnaire and it read as ""average"" too. I don't know why his initial report, and his responses to the questionnaire are so different. My dad at the time was also going through a lot, and I didn't have a great relationship with him because of his anger management problems that were really hurtful. But I was around him a lot at the time, so his answers do mean something. AGAIN I understand that I may not be autistic. Just this report is upsetting me! 

The report did find that I am of ""high average to very high"" intelligence, which definitely could have contributed to the masking? They did a full intelligence test. Also it looks like the only test that they did to me to test me personally for autism was the ADOS-2 test, which I read online has lower accuracy for testing females on the spectrum? 

They also completely MISSED my OCD. At least, they did not notice any relevant OCD symptoms. ANd I had a major OCD crashout at the end of college and after college, leading to an OCD diagnoses. Previous therapists have agreed that I probably have had OCD since middle school, due to looking back at previous symptoms. But this evaluation noted NO OCD at all. 

ALSO what is even more upsetting is that this evaluation did lead to one diagnoses of general anxiety disorder (GAD). They included in the report a nice list of academic, medical, family therapy and household accomodations that could be put in place to help me out with the anxiety, which honestly would have been very nice. But my dad and step mom did not pursue or try a single one of the reccommended accomodations for me. 

  
Anyways, sorry for the rant. I needed to get it all out. It's ok if no one responds, but I think it makes me feel better to think that someone MAY read this and respond. Also, I will try to respond to all comments, but it may be a while because I am very overwhelmed at the moment and am trying to prepare some stuff before my therapy appointment tomorrow. Thank you so much everyone really for all the past and future help. This place has been a literal bouy for me in the middle of a crazy storm right now.

2025-11-06 11:19:21;Im 38 and just got diagnosed.;"So, I have had signs my whole life but only recently have i seen people posting about autism and signs and symptoms. 
Only level 1 but still. I've lived my entire life so far feeling like I have shitty personal skills and I'm terrible friend and companion, spent my entire high-school and most of collage alone. Dating was a nightmare but luckily I was able to keep my shit together and got a wife. Only took like 5 years to get her on board. 😅 
Anyway I feel kinda lost. Just innundated with information and like I've been beating myself up for my anti-social-ness and bad communication for years. Having gone to a counselor for a while and being teated as if I was normal and having problems to fix made it worse. 
So kinda looking for some advice or wisdom. 
Currently in couples and individual tharapy and the more I look into it the more I see that a bunch of issues can be linked directly to typical autism expressions. A bunch of conflict and emotional distress over the years on my wife's part seems ro have been resultant from my lack of awareness of my surroundings or othe people when I'm doing something or focused on task. As well as the lack of emotional validation because well.... I see solutions and problem solve everything instead of listening and validity. But I hear that seems to be a common male thing not an autistic thing but I feel like it may be amplified for me. But idk... anyway... all that said. Some of the 'solutions ' brought up are basically 'fix yourself' like be more aware, be more empathetic,  be less logical and just listen. Like to some extent I think I might be able to, but on the other hand. Wouldn't that be putting extraordinary effort toward being more nuro typical and going against how my brain works just for a modicum of perceived normalness and validation? Is there a middle ground? Am I attributing too much to autism? So many questions and idk where to start..

TLDR
late diagnosed and need wisdom on advice and where to start processing this and integrating the info into my life. Tips and tricks for stress and communication and acceptance and what level of accommodation and compromise should I make for my partner vs how it affects me.
Thanks.";;;;
2025-11-06 10:57:22;Officially diagnosed with autism/adhd;Hi everyone, my name's Ellie, I was recently diagnosed with autism and ADHD (audhd) I'm 24 years old and much makes sense now, I was lucky to have a kind and understanding psychologist, took many appointments and tests but we got there, being officially diagnosed dosent change much other than I have it on paper, but i still feel like im trying to find myself by slowly unmasking as I've been a heavy masker all my life and its been exhausting, anyway thanks for reading, just wanted to post that little bit about my journey.;;;;
2025-11-06 10:15:16;Autism and not having restrictive interests?;"I’m newly diagnosed and my psychologist told me after my assessment that I’m autistic, but I haven’t received the actual report back yet. I’m curious though, do other people on here not have restrictive interests? I’m assuming I don’t fit this since I actually don’t really have many interests at all, which actually has been an issue for me. I do find an interest I just hyperfixate on them for a little bit and then get rid of them (adhd). But overall, I don’t have a special interest. Or maybe I haven’t found one yet? As a kid, I had interests because I had toys, and I would play alone in my room all the time. 
I just feel weird because I’m happy that I’m diagnosed, but feel kind of misplaced, almost like I won’t be accepted into the community in a way. 

Edit: just for background. I’m a highly masking adult female";;;;
2025-11-06 10:07:39;Please help me understand this;"I got diagnosed with autism at 14 years old last month and I'm still trying to understand

(Edited because I worded it horribly)

I spend all of my time with my laptop around me, every day when I sleep and eat ill be around it or its in my room.
My parents tried to take it away for the night because they wanted to me to sleep but I don't understand why I can't have it in my room and sleep?? Anyway it lead to a meltdown because I couldn't handle it being out of my room as everything I have is on there.

I feel like everything I know and love like my hyperfixations, my coping mechanisms and my music is all on the laptop and I can not be without it because it causes me intense stress and anxiety and I'm not sure how to let my parents know that without them dismissing it as an unhealthy attachment or habit that I need to drop. 
I understand they are just trying to do what's best for me and I do appreciate that but there are a lot of things both me and my parents don't understand and/or are not aware of yet, all of this is new and we are trying to find better ways to deal and approach situations like these but I'm not sure where to go from here because they want to limit the time I spend with it which I really don't want and I don't think I can cope with.

2025-11-06 08:49:19;is having a favorite person a thing in someone who is diagnosed with autism and not bpd?;"im going to make a slight mention of SA at some point, so yeah beware

ive been questioning whether i had bpd or not a lot in the past and now the doubt is getting stronger than ever. might be spiraling, i dunno.

i (18F) was diagnosed with autism when i was younger and ive always had this habit of having a very specific friend who i depended off quite heavily; for example, my elementary school teachers couldn't recognize whether some drawings were mine or my best friend's due to me always trying to replicate her in some way, plus my mood started depending on her reactions towards me when i was like 9, in fact when she seemed slightly bothered by me i remember i started crying so hard i had to run to the teacher to tell her what i felt, and she did not listen to me at all. 

then i moved out to another city and befriended this one girl in my class when i was 10, and i soon considered her my new best friend, though things started becoming more complicated since she started talking behind my back with my (at the time) ""boyfriend"" and kept provoking me with all my other classmates. not to mention that she also SAd me in her bedroom once and lied to me about stealing my phone and texting my old friends i hated them. this was hurting me so much i decided to text her (yeah, i was still 10) and ask her why she was treating me like that, and after she said pretty mean things to me like ""she felt like she had to vomit near me"" i wrote her a whole paragraph where i told her i hated her and she sucked. her parents intervened and almost sued my family lol.

then i started following a ballroom dance course and i met my duo companion, who was this one girl who never really understood my interests (that i later found out were hyperfixations), but she was my best friend, my ride or die, and i was completely devoted to her for sticking with me. but as soon as i decided to move dance courses (i was 12 at the time) she never texted me back and made up excuses to avoid seeing me.

then i started texting to this girl on instagram (who i still talk to nowadays) and she was also very dear to me, i even thought i was crushing on her once, but at some point she became friends with this girl and i got so jealous i couldnt function properly for days and i unfortunately also treated her pretty badly. things with this friend are now doing good though, but thats time was really overwhelming.

during that time i had a best friend in middle school, and this was a bond that lasted until last year, because we were in a relationship that resulted being quite toxic due to her not being able to be in a relationship and me being emotionally dependant on her. i couldnt sleep, eat and do anything because i was scared she was going to leave. thank god this lasted until last year because my dependency wore off some way...and i wish i could do that manually instead of having to deal with years of pain.

and as for now i have a best friend who i think i am in a situationship with, and i dont think that things are going well. i get constant paranoia and i often end up feeling like i did with my ex, also because i ended up saying terrible things i now regret , that now im forced to keep for myself for as long as possible. my feelings and choices totally depend on how our friendship is going and it's slowly deteriorating me mentally and also physically (a clear example could be her not texting me goodnight, which can make me feel like the world is ending).

i know that a similiar phenomenon happens to people with borderline personality disorder, and i noticed a similiar pattern with how things are going on for me, but as for now im diagnosed with autism, social anxiety and i dont understand if it's cyclothymia (basically a variant of bipolar disorder) or depression because it changes everytime; i really domt understand how this thing affecting my stronger relationship is related to my diagnosis and im unable to go to another therapist due to a sort of appeal i made with my family to be able to see one...but thats a long story.

is anyone here experiencing any of this, and please can you help me clarify the favorite person thing? because i dont want to use this term if its strictly for bpd cases.";;;;
2025-11-06 08:36:29;Does anyone who was diagnosed as a kid, secretly wish they weren't?;"I am in my early twenties now, and was diagnosed with ASD when I was eight. I know that this is a sensitive topic, but I feel as if my life has been ruined due to this diagnosis and it seriously depresses me. 

My family never believed in me growing up, and pathologised all of my negative emotions as an ASD trait or ""meltdown"". I feel as if I cannot express strong emotions without people viewing them as inherently irrational. I was told of all the things that I could not do due to my ASD, despite the fact that I am high-functioning and capable of succeeding under the right circumstances. I was bullied by my own brother, who never even had a problem with me before becoming aware of my diagnosis. That is when the shaming and distancing began from him. This diagnosis feels like a weapon at my families disposal at times. A way to perpetually undermine, patronise, and shame me for normal reactions or desires under the guise of ""looking out for me"" or ""being honest"". 

My whole childhood was assements, tests, therapy, behavioural programmes, psychologists, psychiatrists, OT's, SLT's, etc. I was forced into resources and special education despite excelling during my first year of secondary school. I was constantly talked down to and made to feel inferior. I was ostracised and made the schools pariah, along with the other ASD kids. I was followed by SNA's (I never had an SNA or needed one) as if they had authority over me and I even had to report this to the school to make it stop, I was paired with low-functiong kids for teamwork as if we were not to assimilate with the ""normal"" kids, and I was even awarded a ""Special Achievement Award""...I wish that I was joking. It was a made up award for me and another autistic student, with rainbow colours and childish designs, while all the other students recieved proper professional academic awards. It was in front of an entire assembly too, so you can only imagine how humiliating it was.

I missed out on friends and many milestones due to the stigma and isolation that I faced. I developed depression and this crippled me for years. I internalised the worst of beliefs about myself. It was a struggle for me to find work due to my underdeveloped social skills since I never even had the opportunity to mask with all my peers already knowing my medical information. I was a bitter and angry person for a long time because I was frustrated with how differently people chose to treat me. I hate this diagnosis so much and I would rather not have it. 

The irony is now that I have left school and am now in college, nobody would believe that I have ASD anyway since I am perceived as a ""normal"" looking girl on the surface. Even a psychiatrist did not believe me since apparently I am too articulate to have ASD. Which is obviously very ignorant, and feels like an extra slap in the face after everything that I have endured due to this damn diagnosis. Too high-functioning to even be taken seriously as struggling, but too abnormal to be accepted as a longterm option for anyone or any job. What even is this diagnosis? I would be so much better off without it, as it has only caused me grief and pain. 

I want the regular and carefree childhood that I never got to have. Honestly though, I will probably move away one day and leave this label behind me. Does anyone else relate or have a similar experience/feelings? ";;;;
2025-11-06 08:30:27;Tips to preventing meltdowns (or lessening the intensity) for adults;Hello all, sorry I am new to posting on reddit. I 22f have been struggling recently. My insurance is changing so I will have access to therapy soon but until then I have been having increasingly intense meltdowns. I experience being non verbal, crying, and scratching my arms and legs (This being the most concerning part to me). I have seen people saying their meltdowns lasting long periods of time (an hour or more) but mine have been incredibly short so far. My main trigger is when somthing I am working on goes wrong and if I am listening to something while that happens it makes the situationmuch worse as i get overwhelmedby the noise. I was hoping to get more information on how to handle this until I can get a professional diagnosis and help.

2025-11-06 08:28:22;Age gap relationships with both the younger and older person on the neurodivergent spectrum. The possibility for delayed maturity and advanced maturity in neurodivergents.;"I preface this post by saying 16 is the age of consent where I live, I am attending college, and I am in the process of getting emancipated from my parents since they are both unfunctional with me essentially having to raise myself. We get little suspicious looks while out in public and have been told by strangers that we look good together. Also, my mom, my grandparents, our friends, and his parents are in support of the relationship. The family and friends who support us believe he is incapable of taking advantage and he is the vulnerable one in the relationship, having little to no social awareness. 

I am 16 years old and am suspected to have ADHD, with my psychiatrist shying away from diagnosing me since I am functionable. I was also diagnosed with sensory processing disorder at a very young age. I toe walked as soon as I was able to walk (resulting in a corrective surgery) and cross my eyes involuntarily, so I have to wear glasses. He is 28 and was adopted at 3 years old after being neglected in foster care for the first few years of his life, only beginning to talk at 4 almost 5 years old, and was diagnosed with high functioning autism and minor fetal alcohol syndrome.

 People assume due to the perception of our maturity levels that I am 18 or 19 and that he is in his early twenties. He is more prone than I am to episodes where he is overstimulated, takes something the wrong way, or is over fixated. I find myself often having to calm him down and reason to him with rationality. He is very academically smart especially in math and is intellectually gifted but often says the things he should do instead of doing them. He is more spontaneous and unorthodox than I am. He has proved successful having a sales guidance business before in his early to mid-twenties, with him now starting it up again. When he talks to people, he compensates for his oddities by presenting as very serious. 

My purpose for posting this is for advice on neurodivergent age gap relationships and experience with delayed and advanced maturity in these individuals.          ";;;;
2025-11-06 07:59:55;Is fear of asking people for something a trait ?;"This has been an issue for me for as long as I can remember, I’ve always been terrified of asking people for basically anything.

My parents always said I was an easygoing kid who never asked for anything / had a tantrum over a thing. I’m now realising that was because I was so scared of asking that the chance of rejection wasn’t worth the chance of getting what I wanted, it’s not like they would crash out but the fear of being politely rejected was still overwhelming. 

This applies to situations where I should be asking for things, Christmas and Birthday’s were a nightmare because I’d be bombarded with requests for what I wanted that year and I could never give anyone a straight answer. This meant either my Mother would have to guess what I wanted or get me talking about things I enjoyed so she could note things down, I had no problem talking about the things I liked but the actual actions of asking for something felt physically impossible.

Even in situations at school where I wanted something like a pen because I forgot mine or a piece of paper I would just sit there and attempt to improvise something until a friend bext to me would see the sorry scene in front of them and put me out of my misery 

Yeah idk, I’ve just been recently diagnosed and I’m trying to find links to issues I commonly have with this being the biggest one. If this is a thing does anyone have any advice to make it easier to ask for stuff? I’m 17m btw ";;;;

I have a diagnosis of autism and ADHD, and this has certainly affected my ability to absorb information over the years, especially when given orally, and this has pissed people off.

2025-11-06 06:55:45;Forcing a special interest on yourself...;"Is it possible? 

  
41F, diagnosed late with Level 1 ASD last November. Also ADHD, BPD, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD. I'm on a plethora of medications. 

It's exhausting. I truthfully have no idea how I've managed all these years. I never ask for help, and very, very rarely talk about my mental struggles. I annoy myself with them, so I constantly feel as if I'd be a bother to anyone and everyone else if I were to talk about them. Very introverted and mostly keep to myself anyways. 

My Special Interest phases last maybe a couple months to a couple years usually, depending what they are. The longest one was like 15 years of playing World of Warcraft, which I forced myself to quit. The latest was 3 months of collecting plants. Now I have an overwhelming amount of plants that went from being almost over cared for, to borderline neglected. Photography was like 5 years, until my dad's camera was stolen so I lent him mine, 8 years ago. Once, I read more books in one month than I have throughout my entire lifetime. 

My most favorite one though... I exercised faithfully for 6 months and lost 85 lbs. I looked amazing and I was so darn proud of myself. That was over a decade ago, and well... things have changed. 

I'm currently in a funk (and have been there for quite some time) where I am unmotivated to do anything. I care so much about doing things and try to get things done, like chores and tasks, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I just shutdown when I'm at home, like having consumed all my energy just by going to work (a desk job). 

I would, if I could, just sit in bed every evening and all weekend, not move a thing just to avoid having to clean/do chores. If I didn't make a mess, then there's no mess to clean. If I start in the kitchen doing a few dishes, somehow, I end up (after doing something in each room along the way) in the basement rummaging through storage, looking for something ridiculous that has no relevance to what I've been doing or thinking up to that point. ""Oh! That's where that went.. I could totally use this!"" \*\*item sits on shelf for the next year\*\*

I really need to get back into a healthier lifestyle, lose a whole bunch of weight and start caring about myself more. 

I'm trying to figure out a way to force the special interest of exercising, losing weight and getting/eating healthier. 

Any suggestions/recommendations?";;;;

I get stuck in a void for hours or even all day depending how long my mom is gone. I just sit in my chair and stare into my phone and I’m not even doing anything on my phone. Probably doomscrolling or lurking in a discord server. I had a burst of energy while my mom was gone this morning to get up and do laundry and put dishes away but then it went away. My mom came home and it was like I was cured. Then she left again for a few hours and it was like I didn’t even exist I just sat and stared and did nothing. Then she came home and after a few minutes I was better again. Does anyone else get like this?";;;;
2025-11-06 05:56:33;Assessing the impact a formal diagnosis may or may not have on my life;"A few weeks ago I made the personal revelation that I am almost certainly on the spectrum. I’ve spent these last few weeks crying my eyes out and drinking every night. I’ve been replaying my whole life within the context of autism. All the strange things I’ve said in my relationships. Why I always watch the same shows and YouTube series over and over ad nauseum. My emotional probs. The fact that I typically shower every 2-3 days. How I used to go to the bathroom and shut the lights off when things got overwhelming at work. How I’d memorize quotes from video game trailers and repeat them to my (few) friends at random moments. My probs with eye contact. The list goes on and on. 

I’m still a bit down about this realization but I also feel as though a weight has been lifted. Like I have the answers I’ve been searching for, for a very long time. The question weighing me down now is- now what? I’m so torn as to whether or not I should get a diagnosis. On the one hand a dx could lend legitimacy when I tell my close friends and family. On the other hand, I’m afraid of stigmatizing labels and restrictions. Not to mention I don’t want to end up on some sort of govt database. I have no intention of going fully public anytime soon so idk exactly what an official dx could do for me. 

It’s worth mentioning that I am diagnosed with ADHD. I struggle in other areas but I am for the most part pretty high masking. People usually think I’m just very intelligent at best, or odd, eccentric, or annoying at worst. I would imagine my support needs would be minimal but I do have some especially in areas of executive functioning. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!";;;;

2025-11-06 05:10:10;Do you think the Autism-Burnout is real? My story;"Hi,

I am mid-30, having been diagnosed with loads like depression, personality disorders, schizophrenia, alcohol-disorder aso. asf.

Working as a nurse, shifts are a problem. I managed it until lately, worked all the years and it felt okay. Feeling unwell and unable to manage stuff, was part of my life.

Just to let you know - my routine:

MENTALLY FINE: Duolingo, doing language exercises, sport, chores, playing guitar, take care of myself, CS2

MENTALLY OKAY: Duolingo, some language, chores, playing guitar, take care of myself, CS2

MENTALLY EXHAUSTED: Duolingo, playing guitar, take care of myself, CS2

MENTALLY UNFINE: Duolingo as hard as it could be, I did it!!!, playing guitar, somewhat take care of myself, CS2

MENTALLY RIGHT NOW: --- sleep --- sleep --- sleep

  
Normally, I used to sleep off any stress or alcohol abuse or so on - just 2 lazy days, everything turned fine and I was back to life. But this one feels really off. I cannot do my Duolingo, I feel like crazy, I just want to go back to sleep and be back in Real World.

I was not able to Duolingo any day in the last few days - nor to react to any WhatsApp. Just Doomscrolling and falling asleep again. 

I am on Lisdex for the ADHD-part since Mid-Summer and took my off-days after a 7 or 10 shift just to calm down, 1 or 2 days are lazy - but afterwards everything is ""perfect"". But this time I feel like crazy. Off drugs is a nightmare, on drugs is not improving.

My sleep cycle is off, I would like to meet up with people but I cannot, I would participate in life but I cannot, I would like to groom myself but I cannot.

  
To answer further questions: Actually this happened earlier this year even before I got diagnosed.

I had bad weeks at work, not enough rest, private life went bad...

After this happening I got hospitalised and got the final diagnosis of ADHD/Autism.

But still, when everything is fine, it works out but this time in my spare time it feels so exhausting. I would like to book a travel or be able to play my guitars - instead I am in a cycle of exhaustion and unability to touch it.";;;;
2025-11-06 05:07:30;I got taken out of school, and I don’t know what to do;"I (17yo) was taken out of school at the end of my sophomore year in 2024, due to sensory issues, burnout, anxiety, and so much more that had gotten worse as the years had passed. It had gotten so bad to where I could not focus, I would go home crying and lock myself in my room for hours on end. My mom finally had enough and decided to take me out of school.

For a little bit of context, Im not officially diagnosed with autism yet, Im in the process of trying to get diagnosed. All the research I’ve done points to me likely having autism, along with many memories that make it more likely Im autistic. Although I tend to second guess myself at every turn, my experiences tell me otherwise.

With this, I was never able to get appropriate accommodations throughout school, constantly getting ostracized and alienated from my peers, with occasionally being made fun of or bullied, all of this on top of occasional sensory issues that make my skin crawl through the day and a bit more, this made it very difficult to get through school without masking and burning myself out slowly. 

Eventually when I did end up getting homeschooled, I had my emotional processing finally catch up with me. Years of unfelt feelings and anxiety resurfaced and led to me unable to be alone for a few hours without a debilitating panic/anxiety attack (or it could have been a meltdown, Im still not too sure). It made doing my schoolwork almost downright impossible. 

While i’ve since recovered a little bit (still having occasional problems, but not as much as before), I had began catching up school work these past few months, only to find out via another homeschooler my mom had known through work, that my homeschool program I was using was not eligible in my state (Georgia).

It made me very upset to realize all the work I had put in to get things done was for nothing. Now we’re stuck looking for other homeschooling options that are available in Georgia. My only fear is it not being very accessible for me, since I have a deeply rooted social anxiety that mostly began due to school, and my learning style is very particular, needing lots of information to understand a concept fully. (which is another reason I had struggled through school.)

Not only this, but im afraid my lack of official diagnosis will make me unable to get the accommodations I need to have. Not to mention the guilt I already feel when I tell others Im autistic without a diagnosis, even though Ive done the research and all signs point towards it being true, I still feel like im lying to people without anything official.

Im also afraid that I won’t be able to catch up with everyone my age that’s technically going to graduate next year. I feel very behind and shameful I couldn’t get more done before.

So my question is, does anyone have any homeschooling experience? And if so, what programs did you use? Did you end up officially graduating?

And, can anyone relate to my predicament in anyway? (The non-official autism diagnosis guilt, and/or the schooling problems) Just so I know Im not alone, as it’s felt that way in my situation for a very long time.

But nonetheless, thank you for reading this.";;;;
2025-11-06 04:47:02;Did anyone else struggle with their parents not wanting you to go to university?;"Hi! So basically, my entire life i've known i was going to go to university. My parents know this, and have been fine with it. My older sibling is at university too. I'm in the middle of the application process right now. But in June I got my diagnosis, and ever since my parents have been completely unsupportive about me going. They believe i'll struggle being away from home and being independent. Mind you, i  have never struggled with this and i'm very high functioning. I hate my home city, and I want to move away, but they're insistent on me staying at home and commuting, or at least going to the same university as my sibling, which I don't want to do. They have never had these concerns before, but since June they won't shut up about it. Am I blowing this out of proportion? I've tried to tell them how I feel but it always turns into a fight.

i do have OCD ( yet to be fully diagnosed but i 100% have it ) and i was told that ocd and autism are similar but i feel they’re different to me and im just stuck 

it’s like my mind “ wants to be autistic “ and it frustrates me and makes me sad 

i’m going have to talk to my teacher about it tomorrow, there is times where i get these 5 seconds where i feel like im going burst, is it stimming ? i will scratch the crap the hell outta my neck and it’s getting worse but my mental health is better than it was 

any advice? ";;;;
2025-11-06 04:28:03;How to get 15 yr old brother assessed?;"I’m 24F & was diagnosed when I was 11/12. I did not know I was autistic until I was 15 & seen it on some papers. Me parents never told me & they don’t believe the diagnosis is correct.

Got a 15 yr old brother who’s struggling in school & teachers & the principal don’t like him. When he was younger, there was a teacher that had a restraining order on him. He’s been threatened with expulsion loads. Teachers have harmed him physically multiple times but apparently that’s allowed in England? We’re Irish & came over when he was six. 

Before we left Ireland, they did a psychological assessment bcz teachers said his behaviour was causing serious risks to his health & safety & affecting his ability to learn.

I do think he also has ADHD but anyways. We have parents who don’t approve of any of this nor do they believe they have disabled children. 

Me ma is actually a diagnosed ADHD’er. I personally believe me da’s autistic but he’s not diagnosed. However, he constantly talks about how I’m not autistic bcz I’m just like him lol.

So, yeah, we live in England. I’m wondering how to help him get assessed for autism & ADHD. Is it possible even though I’m only his big sister & not his parent? He needs his parents, doesn’t he? Without them him getting assessed is impossible?";;;;
2025-11-06 04:13:55;What are your best tips for getting back on track after your routine gets disrupted?;"I was recently diagnosed, and I decided to build a pretty strict routine since that’s one of the main things recommended for autistic people. Honestly, I didn’t realize how much I needed routine until something happened yesterday that completely threw me off. It’s the next day now and I still can’t seem to get back on track!!

For about 2 weeks I had a solid routine going.. work, gym, chores, and all the daily tasks I needed to stay on top of, but and now everything feels off…

For those of you who’ve been through this, what helps you reset after your routine gets disrupted?";;;;
2025-11-06 04:04:43;Autistic is now basically a slur and I hate that.;"It basically is at this point. I feel like it started when the whole 'youre so acoustic' thing started like last year when I was at this summer camp a bunch of guys would just call eachother acoustic and it was also a short internet meme but now instead of peaople using that dumb meme as a fake r word they just gave up on even disguising the pure ableism they are showcasing and are now just calling people straight up Autistic.

whenever they mess up and this year in my school theyre doing the same thing like I feel like now whenever someone is acting 'weird' or 'crazy' in an unhinged or abnormal way they just use the term. 

  
Like what? Why? Who let this happen 😭.

Also I hate it more because sometimes they use it as a way to say something is quirky and it just feels so useless like you can literally use any other word to convey the same meaning. Today my friend who is NT was doing this weird food combo as a joke and this guy walked up to her and was like.

  
""What is that? You so autistic!""

And I was just like *dude...*  you could use literally any other word. in fact you could just call her a weirdo or whatever why must you use the term autistic? Its just so annoying and not even practical so its twice as bad like.. IF YOURE GOING TO BE ABLEIST ATLEAST HAVE A FUCKING POINT! Talk about a redundant use of the word. also its a description/diagnosis of someone so youre using in the wrong way ANYWAYS.

  
Ugh just boils my blood. Is it just my school or is this a world wide pandemic at this point?";;;;
2025-11-06 03:42:54;Not sure if I like to be alone or if I learned to be okay with it;"I got diagnosed with Autism at 19 and it's been a little while since then. I have been coming to realizations going ""oohhhh, that's why I  did/didn't like this or that growing up"". The more recent thing is if I actually like being alone or if that's just something I defaulted to

There is a lot of things that lead to other people saying that I am alone wolf. Few examples being, since I was little I tended to drift away from big crowds, more so for the noise, and I hated things like group assignments because I could never explain myself properly or classmates would just not understand/change my words, so I just ended up doing assignments on my own.

I am currently getting a graduate degree away from home, and I find making friends hard since everyone here seems to have already known each other beforehand. I find myself being lonely, which has lead me to fall into a bit of a rabbit whole of times I was genuinely lonely. Mainly times that people didn't invite me to things under the assumption that I wouldn't be interested like going on a picnic or just going out with the family. For awhile I have defaulted to just saying things like ""I like being alone"" when prompted but I can't help but question if it's less of a ""like"" more of a ""learned to be this way. I am trying to be more vocal and expressive in general but it has been a slow process.";;;;
2025-11-06 03:09:28;Has anyone else been super protected all their life?;"I'm (31M) someone who has been active on various neurodivergent subreddits for quite some time now. I did notice that, among the active users, they tend to skew to two extremes. The first is that they were forced to be hyper independent, likely high masking, and get out of whatever situation they were in (e.g., poor living conditions, poverty). The second is that they are not independent individuals at all and tend to live at home out of necessity and to be accommodated for activities of daily living.

In my case, I'm someone who graduated with a PhD almost three months ago now and I'm looking for a full-time job since I recently finished ""teaching"" an online 8-week course. I put teaching in quotes since all of the materials were already made for me and I just had to grade assignments and communicate with students. I didn't even need to upload my own lectures. I did upload one for graduate school admissions tips on my YouTube channel, but that was the only time I did so because I had some good students this semester.

I can do most activities of daily living, but (like a recent viral AuDHD Tiktok stated) I have to mask a fair bit and I'm just exhausted doing so. Sometimes I wish my traits were more obvious so I could be accommodated inside of being stuck inside this weird ""grey area"" where folks treat me like I'm neurotypical with odd quirks. In my case, I've had a ton of outside help my parents have hired for me ever since my senior year of high school. I had a life coach my senior of high school and for all four years of undergrad since my university didn't have a program that helps autistic and/or neurodivergent students with academic and social support. During my gap year before graduate school (Master's then PhD began), I had a different coach who helped connect me with others who knew about graduate school admissions and what they'd like to see. After that year, I consulted with them for my PhD program applications. I've recently started working with them again over the past almost 4 years now after I had a falling out with my first PhD advisor and funding issues that led to me starting my research over from scratch and working an outside job too, which graduate programs normally don't allow. In my case though, my funding ran out so I had no other choice and my new PhD advisor was fine with it.

Even in childhood, I remember my father coming to recess with me since I had a hard time fitting in with the other students. He also helped me master the monkey bars since I got made fun of by a lot of other kids for not doing well on them. I would often yell, ""I can't do it!"" quite often when it was something I didn't want to do (like riding a bike), but I did it anyway. In general, I never liked sports and was insecure about it. However, the solution in my father's eyes was to just get better at the physical activities despite my coordination issues. I wish I knew then what I knew now, which is that there was nothing wrong with that at all and I should've accepted myself.

My parents also found a private high school where I graduated with a class of 8 students (including me) and accommodated neurodivergent students. That experience I had was a big reason I wanted to pursue my PhD, but I was woefully underprepared for undergrad because there was no AP, IB, honors, or foreign language courses offered at all. I had 26 credit hours of dual enrolled credits that I did well in, but the transition to a full-time undergrad was where I had struggles. Hence the life coach sticking around who I mentioned earlier. I ultimately didn't graduate with honors in my undergrad either, which was why I needed the other coach for graduate program application assistance.

The main thing I'm always told when I tell my story is that I've been super protected by my family. I used to be ashamed of it, but I'm not in hindsight since I think anyone in my circumstance would've taken advantage of the resources offered to them. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had a similar life experience? If I'm truly that isolated of a case then it is what it is, but I'm curious.

Edit: I didn't mention this in the post, but that coach I had in undergrad wasn't neurodiversity affirming sadly so now I've only recently learned to let go of my internalized ableism and not bash myself if I don't do things the way others do it. My parents also knew I was got diagnosed 9 years old, but I wasn't told until I was 14 since my parents thought I'd use my diagnosis as a reason to keep hitting my self-esteem. So, as much as I'm glad they supported me, I have to unlearn some things and eventually get myself a full-time job as they teeter towards their elder years.

Edit 2: I forgot to also mention this, but I'm seeing an ND affirming executive functioning coach and therapist. My parents are on board with it right now, which is great. I've had to switch therapists a couple of times at the practice I've seen since September 2024, but I like this current one since they do executive functioning coaching too.";;;;
2025-11-06 02:07:04;Son with audhd cant play alone?;"My daughter is diagnosed with high functioning autism and very much likes to be by herself in her room doing her own thing (art, laptop etc….)

My son is 4 years younger and has been on the waiting list for autism and adhd for sometime. He has more additional needs than my daughter though. 

(I also have high functioning autism). 

My son cant seem to solo play with anything, but when anyone plays with him he screams and shouts that they’re not doing it right and can sometimes start hitting or just has a massive meltdown.

This is becoming an every single day occurrence. He refuses to play alone and insists his sister, me or his mum play roblox (or whatever) with him. He insists we play the games he wants and like i said, screams at us when we do. 

He wont ever leave his sister alone so they end up fighting every single day because she wants to be by herself and he wont leave her alone.

It always ends up his mum sitting playing roblox all evening every evening to try and keep him from meltdowns (he then just meltdowns when he loses on the game anyway, but at least it keeps him off our daughters back). 

It keeps my wife occupied entertaining him all evening every evening and then come bed time he’s in and out of bed all night asking for his mum or complaining he cant sleep. We’re lucky if we get to sit down together by midnight and its exhausting. 

I’m at my wits end but then feel guilty when i tell him he has to start playing by himself and he starts crying and throwing tantrums";;;;

2025-11-06 01:50:38;Grief and autism;"Hey all. I’m a recently diagnosed 35 y/o woman. My husband and I are child free by choice. A huge part of being okay with not having children had been that we had the most perfect and amazing dog there ever could be. We adopted cas a year into our marriage and we had the most incredible 7 years with her. She was a corgi Pomeranian and if a pet can be a special interest she was one of mine. I miss everything about her. She truly was like a best friend. She provided me with copious amounts of co regulation and now that she’s gone I’m fucking gutted. We lost her very suddenly in July. She got sick on Friday and was gone by Monday. The grief is so difficult. People don’t get it. They don’t understand how my dog was my entire world. A literal piece of me. I needed her. She gave me life and joy and purpose and life without her now is empty and lonely. I go to a virtual monthly pet loss group and a lot of us ND participants talk about how important our fur babies are to us and everything they bring to our life. She was a part of every routine. And she’s just…gone.

2025-11-06 01:44:23;UK therapy training- which modality?;"I am a late-diagnosed AuDHDer (I suspect PDA also). I have an undergrad degree in psychology and a PhD in neuroscience. I’d now like to train as a therapist. I need to start from scratch- no clinical training. 
I’m struggling to decide which modality to train in as a foundation. I’m keen to eventually offer IFS, perhaps EMDR and ACT as these are all neuroaffirming. But these and most other modalities that I hear are most helpful for neurodivergent folks are CPD level modalities. So I’m not sure what will be the best fit for my initial training, both in terms of accommodating my needs, and not leaving me feeling gaslit during the training, as well as for the sake of future neurodivergent clients.  

I’m tempted by pure person-centred, but wonder if I’d be better off doing a more humanistic/integrative training in terms of future employability and flexibility? Definitely planning to avoid CBT. I found psychodynamic psychotherapy to be mostly a waste of time, and my therapist was very dismissive/challenging about my ADHD diagnosis, but I don’t know if that’s typical? I’ve had the most benefit from IFS personally. Would rather not have to unlearn too much once I get past my initial diploma/masters and onto those kinds of trainings. 

I’m also getting a headache trying to make sense of all the various options and levels of training available in the UK. I’m in the southeast and considering the Norwich centre (person centred), CPPD in London (humanistic/integrative), UEL (integrative), but there are obviously several other London options. I’m quite intrigued by psychosynthesis after researching it today, but sounds like nobody has really heard of it so that might be a bit limiting. Sounds very compatible with IFS and non-pathologising. Partly wonder if more basic level 2-4 counselling training would be a better fit for me at this stage of life - not really sure about more intense academic challenge and I wouldn’t have to commute to do level 2-4. Help! ";;;;
2025-11-06 01:03:19;How long does Guanfacine/Intuniv really take to work? (AuDHD/CPTSD);"Hey, I'm currently trying Guanfacine/Intuniv. Mainly for neurodivergend burnout (late-diagnosed with ADHD, Autism and CPTSD after years of ""hurdur you're just depressed"").

I'm curious how long does it really take to show its full potential? I've read so many conflicting statements. Some people say they feel instant relief for all their ailments (I'm always cautious about those claims). Some people say it takes up to 6 weeks on a stable dose before it shows its full effect? Then there's some middle ground where people claim it's 2-3 Weeks on a dosage.

I'm at 7 weeks total right now. Worked up to 3mg fairly fast, felt some light improvements at that dosage (took that for about 3 weeks). Upped to 4mg two week ago, feels like the drowsiness is now much more pronounced without further positive effects, so I might go back to 3mg. But I read that 0,05mg/kg are ideal for adults and that puts me at \~4mg with my weight. So with all the conflicting information on how long it actually takes to work and stabilize your PFC I'm really confused.

Overall my experience has been kinda mixed so far. I do notice some minor positive improvements. Sleep is better. Getting up in the morning is easier. In general my struggles with transitions are lessened. When I look back at the past few weeks some small improvements in my life happened, things that I couldn't do for a very long time now just work without me stressing out about it. But there's no feeling of relief. My anxiety is the same. Am I just impatient? I do feel like this medication is helping me in a very subtle way to work up the spiral over a long time, so kinda like a catalyst. But no new positive feelings or motivation. I know that this medication isn't working that way, but my psychiatrist had the theory that by addressing the blockage in my nervous system I might start to feel in a more pronounced way.

My main issue is that my nervous system is extremely dysregulated. It feels like I'm stuck on fight/flight all the time at once. My PFC functionality is also really limited at the moment. I have insane brainfog, no motivation, the only emotions I feel are the stressful ones. Also my thinking is mostly hijacked by compulsiveness and anxious stress patterns, everything feels so reactive, no real ""top-down"" control. Therapy is not working at all in this situation. I know what to do, how to think different etc. But in practice it's just not possible right now. Am I expecting too much from this one medication? Does it just need more time?

I've tried them all, so this is like one of my last options. Stimulants do kinda work, but on their own they just push me more into burnout-mode. I had some good experiences combining the intuniv with 20mg vyvanse, but I want to reach a stable dose before I further experiment with this combination.

Not looking for medical advice, just asking for your experiences and maybe some pointers where to look up further information.";;;;

2025-11-06 00:40:40;Trying to understand what I’m feeling.;"Undiagnosed 36M 

I recently started therapy as I have had some extreme (for me at least) anxiety that was crippling me. With in the first couple sessions, my therapist brought up that she thinks I have adhd and autism. The adhd didn’t really surprise me. I’ve struggled with the ability to focus since I was a kid. I learned coping mechanisms to get me through and I’ve noticed my hyper fixations that come and go like the wind. The autism part was unexpected. I told a friend about being told I may have autism and his response was that he assumed that I did years ago. He is diagnosed so he is more likely to recognize it. I’ve been looking into it, trying my best not to hyper fixate on it. A lot of what the symptoms (not sure that’s the right term) feel very familiar. I’m beginning ing to accept that this is a possibility. Even bought a book on it. This has brought on so much more of an awareness of myself. Things feel different now. I feel like I’m now exhibiting more of the things I’ve read. I don’t know if it’s just that I’m more aware or am I mimicking them. I’m genuinely confused about what I’m feeling now.

I took a physiological evaluation recently that is designed to help identify multiple different conditions, including autism and adhd. I’m waiting for my appointment next week to learn the results. Although I wonder if my responses accurate or “correct”. So I’m now worried that it will lead to a misdiagnosis.";;;;
2025-11-05 22:22:24;Coming off medication (with doctor’s support);"So, my path to diagnosis was a long one. 

Throughout my life I’ve been misdiagnosed with anxiety and depression a few different times. Only as an adult did I suspect ND and then go for an assessment and was subsequently diagnosed AuDHD. 

Since then I’ve discovered so much about myself and view current and past experiences through an entirely different lens. My mental wellbeing has improved tremendously as a result. I’m also thankful I’ve found ADHD meds quite effective so I’m working better too. 

I’ll admit I’ve been so fortunate with my more recent care experiences and that I have a good job, supportive family etc.

But anyways, I’ve been on an SSRI for close to 2 years.its helped a lot with my anxiety and RSD. My doctor has recommended that I come off of it slowly since my condition has improved so much. But I’m very afraid the anxiety and RSD will just return. Any experiences? Thank you ";;;;

Here’s the example she gave me; “when I’m talking to people I don’t ask them questions because I don’t have to ask you questions since you just tell me”

I’ve started to like overthink my own behavior when talking to them to try and make sure i’m the best friend I can be so they don’t leave but I realized when they talk to me about whatever (most conversations types) I often will respond with something about myself that relates to what they just said. For a long time I thought this was like a good way to relate to them and show that I care and understand and now I realize i’ve been self absorbed. I feel sick with guilt and don’t know what to do either because these friends have not been perfect to me and it might be best to let them drift. But if I do let them drift then I’ll literally have no friends for my senior year of highschool and I’m already losing my mind not being able to talk to people. I also realized I talk a lot in general about myself and have been trying lately to do that less. It’s hard for me because I don’t really know how to respond without adding my experience or opinion in. I don’t wanna just be like yeah man cool 👍 like I want to have real and good conversations but i literally can’t figure out how. On a good note i’ve never had my room so tidy, and i haven’t had grades this good since 5th grade (right before the pandemic). But i mean like yay i get to sit alone and depressed in my clean room! My brain is so infested with my stupid little obsessions that i get for some reason and I can’t think of anything else. Like it really upsets me that I spend so much of my time thinking about the deeper meaning of a video game I love, or a book, or a cartoon. But if i’m not thinking about one of those things i’m over analyzing myself. I sit and think about why do I feel this way or why did i behave like that daily. I’m trying to like “figure out” what’s wrong with me but logically I know and understand that sitting and thinking about every little thing i feel or do won’t help. I just don’t know what else to do because I’d rather be overconscious of myself rather than have 0 like awareness of myself and my behavior and my impact on other people. I’ve also been staying up until like 4 or 5 in the morning every fucking night. I wake up at 7 am for school and i’m trying to get through the day on 2-3 hours of sleep and little to no food. Idk why i expect myself to be mentally okay when i treat my body so terribly. I really do want to eat and I try but it’s hard to and even hard because I’ve had ED issues in the past and can sort of feel those thoughts coming back. Really not much though, my struggle more so is just trying to get myself to be hungry. I’ve also been really depressed lately and I can’t talk to anyone about it because I’m trying to talk about myself less but man it’s just getting worse and worse. I never really use reddit accept for random specific questions but since I don’t have anyone to go to about allllll this i’m posting here. Not like dissing my friends or anything I understand my feelings are a lot and I can’t dump them all on one person or even on everyone yk. I can’t seem to find a good balance of sharing my feelings and not over sharing. When I share what is like deemed a reasonable amount I end up leaving the conversation feeling so much worse because it’s like the weight on my chest and soul is so much heavier now. I know my poor therapist dreads every session with me because it’s basically everything that i’ve typed out here for an hour straight. If you read this entire thing then dude that’s crazy lmk if u think im losing my mind thanks ;;;;
2025-11-05 20:02:56;Everything is becoming too much;"In the space of a week I found out that my landlady is selling my house so that I have to find somewhere to live (I don't work and struggle with money already, house prices have gone up so much, I don't know if I can afford to move), and then a few days later I received the news that my step sister who I was very close to had died in a very sudden accident (she was only 30). It's too much, I don't deal well with grief or change.

I was already struggling before this, I'd recently gone to my doctor's and been told that the help I needed wasn't available where I live. But now everything is worse. I'm highly emotional and distressed, I have had multiple meltdowns leaving me exhausted and vulnerable, my eating and daily habits have become highly restricted and I'm finding it hard to cope (I suffer with ARFID and been struggling a lot with this lately).

I tried speaking to my family about it and they just keep telling me to get a job even though I've repeatedly told them that I'm not currently able to work. They've never really taken my autism diagnosis seriously and are very condescending about it and expect me to just 'get on with it'  like 'everyone else has to.' I also have no friends to talk to. I have a partner who is very supportive but he is autistic too and has his own issues to deal with. I feel very isolated.

I'm not sure what my point in writing all this is, maybe I just feel lonely and overwhelmed and need advice? I don't know what to do. How can I even start looking for houses when I'm grieving? Sorry for how depressing this all is.";;;;

I just wanted to know if anyone else get a weird stomach feeling like it doesn’t hurt but just feels off and nothing can stop it. My mum says it’s probably anxiety or to do with my periods but even when im not anxious or not due on, it will just sometimes appear for a few hours.

2025-11-05 17:20:19;My dad refuses to accept my autistic brother for who he is;"I am a neurotypical older sibling to an autistic brother. For as long as I have known him, he has always shown behaviours that pointed he may be autistic. It disturbs me that my dad had known him to be autistic all along, but refuses to get him diagnosed because it will ""hurt his future prospects"".

I've developed a resentment towards my dad for this. He often punished my brother by hitting him, and when my brother became older, my dad resorted to harsh words. My brother never defended himself. 

Its hard to watch and listen as my dad spew hurtful things at my brother, as he silently stands there, especially for not being in the present (he likes studying language thru an app on his phone). 

Ironically, this autistic trait is actually inherited from my dad's side. One of his brothers is autistic and nearly half of my cousins are diagnosed with autism. 

I had just got into a screaming match with my dad. He got home from work and yelled at my brother for 'ignoring him', when he's actually preocupied with his phone. The rest of my family tried to tell me that its his fault, but I know fucking well my dad is just being an emotional shit who dumps his stress on his son. 

Now, my dad keeps mocking me with ""Have you taken your meds"" because I'm diagnosed with depression. But thats another story. ";;;;

(I’m late diagnosed audhd) 

I struggled so hard with random things in this game like word scramble & math recall, but was amazing at the piano player, calendar call and absolutely loved the virus buster minigame. I remember my mom having an account on this game too and I was so shocked at how easily she could play some of the games.

Vintage items & old handhelds (specifically the GBA and DS systems) are a big special interest of mine so this is both kinda an autistic realization and also a slight info dump 😂 my wife listens to me ramble all day but I don’t really have any friends who like this kinda stuff to the same extent I do lol";;;;
2025-11-05 15:43:23;I can’t stand colognes and perfumes, and I don’t know how to navigate it anymore;"I guess I just need to vent but also if anyone has any sort of advice to help I would greatly appreciate it. 

I find Reddit posts often share some background context, so I guess the important stuff is that I’m 26F, officially diagnosed with level 1 autism a couple years ago (my country has free healthcare for this which is why I’m able to access it bc I am a broke bitch and wouldn’t have been able to otherwise). I’ve *always* had a great sense of smell. Like, I cried my eyes out to a librarian once because as a kid I smelt a gas leak 20 minutes before the official warning came and the school got evacuated (I follow rules and felt like I couldn’t leave the building without permission) I live in a place with good public transport which is how I get around because I don’t like driving. Over the last couple of months I’ve noticed an uptick in people walking onto crowded trains wearing colognes or perfumes (some people wear colognes and others perfumes), and I really struggle to handle it. 

I’ll be standing, minding my business when a wave of these spray smells hit my nose. Suddenly the neutral smell of the trains that I’m used to is completely interrupted by these overpowering smells. I try to walk away as fast as I can but sometimes the trains are so full I’m stuck. I already struggle with the amount of sensory input happening so I’m on edge. But this tips me over. The worst part is that a mask doesn’t even help because if I don’t escape in time (which often happens due to when I tend to go on the train), I find that the cologne or perfume scent sticks to me. So even after I leave the train I smell like what the person sprayed on them. These smells are overpowering to me, and takes over the smells I use to ground myself. As a result I often find myself going home and then bursting into tears, stripping down, and showering to get the smell off. But it leaves me deregulated the rest of the day. It’s even more frustrating because sometimes I actually *like* the smell chosen, but not being able to escape it makes me feel claustrophobic. On bad days I’ll be disregulated for hours and then I have to not only deal with that but make sure I don’t start lashing out at my loved ones over shit that isn’t even their fault. These instances have been happening more and more, and I’m finding my hair is getting extra frizzy and dry (it will naturally happen in the winter but this is making it worse), and I just feel like I’m drowning. I get why people wear it. Some love collecting it, others struggle with maintaining hygiene (which I can’t judge because we all have our struggles), and idk others want to just smell good. But the way it sticks to me sets me off. 

The more this happens the more frustrated I get, the more I find myself crying, having meltdowns, and generally just losing my shit. I also find that I’m getting more sensitive to it which further exasperates the problem. Just when I thought things couldn’t get worse my brother has moved home. I’m so glad he’s back because he needed a stable landing place, but he loves cologne. I was helping him pack and saw like 3 different kinds. He always smells like it but now that he’s here I’m dreading it. His laundry reeks of cologne right now, and there’s a huge pile of it right by my bed. Even with a towel and scented candle (which I’m okay with because it’s mild and doesn’t cling to me since it’s not oil based) my whole room smells and I just want to cry. Normally I can escape the smell at home but now I can’t. 

I don’t know how to politely ask my brother to not wear it anymore. Or if I even should. I know I can’t control the general public but the idea of learning to live with this makes me want to scream. Cologne makes him feel confident, and I don’t want to impact my brother’s self esteem by removing one of the tools that help it. But I also don’t want to endure this. I want to move out but I’m a student, have no job (no point looking anymore because I’d have to quit soon to do an internship which will hopefully result in a paid role), and even though I have some small savings I wouldn’t be able to live on my own. 

I’m just tired. It’s 2:30am and I should be asleep, but the smell is still here and I can’t go to bed until I’m ready to blow out the candle. I’m just tired and upset. I wish cologne and perfume companies would stop making products with oil bases because they jump to other people and follow them around, and I know the only way to get rid of it is to shower and isolate the clothes that smell. 

But yeah. Idk. I have to hold it together almost every time I leave the house (I have my routines where I can relax), and the strange smells disturb that. My favourite sniffing bear now smells different too, and I’m just really sad. Anyways, thank you for listening to my vent, I really appreciate it. ";;;;

Anyway what does the need to stim feel like to others, I'm interested if its similar for everyone or if it varies

For me  it feels like my skin suddenly becomes too tight for my body and I this intense feeling that I need to let out like its bubbling under my skin. Sometimes it feels like an intense urge to bark a laugh almost even though I'm not amused by anything. 

It's such an intense feeling, it's very difficult for me to describe in words. What's odd to me is that a lot of the time if its in my legs I need to jump or bounce but if its in my upper body or throat (I guess), I need to like curl in on myself and tense all my muscles and sort of contort-ish. It's weird but I don't feel the need for any repetitive motion when it's an upper body feeling.";;;;

2025-11-05 14:43:41;Should I push for an autism diagnosis for my brother?;"Hello! I am not autistic, but I was hoping this community could give me some advice.

I am an adult with a younger (teenage) brother who likely is autistic but is not diagnosed. Among other things, he misses social cues all the time, spends all of his free time on two very technical subjects, doesn't make eye contact, and is very sensitive to sound and bright lights. Many friends and distant family member have told me he is probably autistic, and I don't disagree.

My brother struggles in school and with social interaction. He is lonely and has trouble communicating questions and problems to his teachers. His grades are low, even though he is very smart. I am concerned for him, and I think my family should seek a diagnosis so he can get accommodations at school.

I have spoken with my parents about this, but the problem is, they don't believe that autism exists. I have sent them scientific papers and research and all sorts of evidence, but they do not believe me. Is there anything I can do to help my brother, as things are right now? I live in the US, if that affects answers in any way. ";;;;
2025-11-05 13:39:48;"Why are autistic people characterized as not diplomatic or ""rude""?";"I've been reading a book about late diagnosed autism. I do relate to some autistic type traits but other I only relate to if I give a lot of explanations as to why so that I'm not misinterpreted, and some traits I don't relate to at all.

From what I've been reading, autistic people have the traits of saying things that are more likely to be read as inflammatory, punishing, ""chaotic"", (but also as unintentionally comedic, or going against their environment's cultural norms of hierarchy or politeness).

I am confused if autistic people are being expected to be always perceived as diplomatic, kind and polite by every single person regardless or circumstance, cultural or value differences, provocations, etc? 

Part of me wonders if autistic people are just more likely to internalize blame towards themselves and feel guilt if people try to control them by saying their speech is rude, even though ""rude"" is very subjective and what feels harmful to one person feels funny or fair to another person. But am I projecting experiences from my life onto what autistic people experience? Are autistic people truly inherently designated as the people who are supposed to take the role of ""doing it wrong"" in order to smooth over and polish the surface of social interactions? Is calling someone ""autistic"" like a softened form of an old school condemnation that the masses learn in typical communication styles, that if someone isn't how you wish them to be you can only protect yourself by saying something is inherently wrong with them?

Maybe I am misunderstanding what type of situations this attribute of autistic people being ""difficult"", ""rude"" etc is coming from, but I'm confused in general at the lack of clarification that perhaps it's possible and common that autistic people are being asked to take too much responsibility for the feelings of other people? Also curious about situations where autistic people are taking too little responsibility for the feelings of other people. And who gets to decide how much responsibility is or isn't enough in each circumstance?

Also I 100% believe responsibility can only accurately and safely be taken when it isn't motivated or guided by shame, punishment, fear, or guilt. Guilt and shame are very different from sadness. I think sadness and grief is feeling bad someone you cared for is hurt, and guilt and shame are about performing an expected song and dance to prevent people from attacking you.

2025-11-05 13:13:26;New to Autism <3 (f28);"I’ve recently realised I am autistic (most likely AuDHD) it’s like as soon as it clicked in my brain and my psychologist told me yes, that’s most likely the case and i’m currently waiting on a diagnosis, that everything seems to be harder or the things that kind of annoyed me before, are now almost unbearable.

There’s so many things I’ve realised I don’t like doing or don’t enjoy but were doing anyway because I thought people were also just doing these things but didn’t enjoy them. I’ve started hating it and getting so nervous when people I don’t really know (strangers or people in the office I work in) start talking to me, I’m over analysing every conversation and I’d rather be left alone. I feel like this is all in my head though?

Speaking of the office, I used to love coming here but now i’m like AHHH strangers, bright lights, cold air con, I hate it so much, how did I spend two years here?

For those not in school, this means until late May. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and honestly having an answer would give me a HUGE self esteem boost and a few other reasons so it isn't just me WANTING it.

I'm putting examples of places it impacts me and how getting it sooner would positively affect me, as well as weighing the pros and cons of an earlier assessment. So far, if I can get an appointment every break (unlikely), I only need to do one during the day and have a few ideas for that.

I was wondering how autism affects YOU (since I feel like I'm forgetting a lot and am genuinely curious) and what do you think I should add? I do have a few things i put that i didnt say but if anyone mentions i will respond saying I have it :\]

thanks for readingggggg!!! :3

I can't believe I'm still saying this to people, and that I have to say it. There's a thing called ableism, children, and that is what it's called when you call your friend autistic for acting stupid. 

It hurts like heck when people I know- people I know to be nice, use the diagnosis I struggle with as something laughable and undesirable. And even though autistic is the one I most commonly hear, I've seen ADHD, dyslexia, OCD and probably a couple others I don't remember used as ways to put people down.

If you're reading this and you use those kinds of words, please remember you never know who's listening. You won't have people to tell you why you're wrong every time you make a mistake, because it is not our heaven-bound duty to educate you every time.

2025-11-05 11:06:47;Late Diagnosis of ASD & ADHD;"​Hi everyone,


​I'm 25 and I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and ADHD this year. I'm reaching out to others who received a late diagnosis to ask: Did you feel this way, and what helped you?


​My path to diagnosis was triggered by a major collapse that I later realized was a severe autistic burnout. I'm currently an engineering student, but months later, I'm still struggling. I feel deeply useless—both at college and at home—because my academic performance has dropped off completely. I also feel like a significant financial burden on my family.


​My psychiatrist helped me realize that being constantly exhausted isn't normal (I always just assumed I was lazy and had to ""power through"" the fatigue).


​Medication Frustration: What makes this phase harder is my struggle with stimulants. Concerta (36mg) has no effect, and 54mg just made me feel extremely jittery and anxious (""like a rattling maraca""). I am now trialing Atomoxetine, which feels promising, but I'm not at the necessary dose yet.


​Loneliness and Loss: To make matters worse, I moved to a new city for university. As someone who takes a long time to make friends, I only managed to make one close friend whom I trusted enough to talk to about all of this when it was happening. Tragically, he passed away over the summer break. Now, I have very few people left to talk to in person. I still have trusted friends in my hometown, but having these difficult conversations via call just isn't the same as talking face-to-face.


​A side note: Since I was about 10, I've only had lucid dreams. My doctor suggests that while it sounds cool, it might be contributing to my overall poor quality of rest.
​

​P.S. English is not my first language, and I'm only accustomed to reading, not writing, in it. I used an AI to help draft this post. Please excuse me if anything sounds awkward or strange";;;;
2025-11-05 10:53:03;halp;"is it normal to, once I start wondering about me being autistic, not be able to stop. I just started a list of my research and how it correlates to me and I know it is not going to be short and consice like how I wanted... the research just is too interesting and I feel a lot of emotions while reading the research but not ALL of it relates to me. Like I feel like I'm ok with eye contact? But sometimes it is hard? Anyways I am not saying I am autistic at all this is all just in prep to better explain to my primary care doctor and my therapist why I am wondering about all of this and why if I am autistic I don't want to go anymore as an undiagnosed female because ofall the misunderstandings and co-occuring issues that that can cause... I feel really anxious about itall but also like my mind is moving super fast trying to collect research and just thinking about it all. I don't know if this is just another mental health thing and I'm being delusional. This is why I worried about my ADHD diagnosis not being legit because I became so obsessed with it in college and I sent so much info to the psychiatrist that was evaluating me... like way too much info. I also have OCD and OCD is all about doubting and ""what ifs"" and being fearful so i could just be overly doubting myself. Anyways I will really try to stop posting on here so much I'm really sorry. I've done this once before years ago when I went on a deep dive intensive research and  session about autism and it was really embarrassing. This is me unfiltered guys I normally think a lot more about how I type things and what I'm trying to say. Just a brain vomit here. I'm really sorry!

Again I'm not saying I'm autistic at all for all this I'm just feeling a lot of emotions and embarrasment and fear from what I am doing but now that I started I feel like I have to finish my research project.  I definitely could just be neurodivergent in another way because I know that what I am doing is really weird. ";;;;

2025-11-05 09:44:28;"I think I learned how to ""be a person"" from cartoons, and now it's kinda catching up to me";"I realized a lot of autistic folks have that sort of cartoonish personality because so many of us learned how to be and act from cartoons. Considering nobody really wanted to be around a lot of us or teach us how to socialize, so we learned from TV characters instead :,)

But for me, I always gravitated toward silent characters like Agent Maine/The Meta from RVB, Snake Eyes from G.I. Joe, Pucca from…. Well…. Pucca, Master Chief from Halo, or even the Rabbids when I’m feeling super energetic.

Because of that, I naturally became quiet and introverted. My biggest “influences” were characters who don’t talk. It’s kind of been detrimental because I’m 20 now, and I still don’t really know how to talk very well. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years, but I definitely started experiencing skill regression after I got my diagnosis at 17.";;;;
2025-11-05 09:26:29;Im a late diagnosed AuDHD mom & excited to be featured on Bravos new Wife Swap show 11/9 @9 w/ Wendy Osefo 🏡;"Hi everyone! My name is Alethea and if there are any adhd Bravo fans in here I wanted to let you all know that I will be featured this Sunday on Bravos new wife swap show. I was really apprehensive but ultimately accepted the opportunity because I felt like, as a late diagnosed autistic/ adhd WOC it would be an opportunity I couldn't pass up to spread awareness, educate and bust some myths and widely held and incorrect stereotypes on what it looks like to be Neurodivergent as an adult. I am a late diagnosed AuDHD & didn't find out till 2 years ago at 44. I was very upfront about it and discussed it a lot during filming but I have no idea ultimately how they edit it, it would be really disappointing if they edit that out and erase my identity. 

my goal was rooted in Neurodivergence activism and education. I talked a lot about prioritizing healing unmasking and engaging in my special interests (Taylor Swift and crafting and animals), as an important part to regulating and health but not sure what they will show! 

I also never thought we would make it through all the interviews and be selected so it was surreal. 💞Representation matters on tv and for people who have a platform to use it to educate especially now a days with so much misinformation…especially on a network like Bravo that has such wide reach!!

anyway, my family had a really fun experience, the Osefo's are a wonderful family! 💃🏽

2025-11-05 08:32:24;Just diagnosed with autism;"I just used Prosper Health and was diagnosed with autism. My assessor was fairly confident - he said he was about 80% confident. I have some doubts but overall I feel kind of relieved because I feel like it explains a lot of my experiences growing up and what I currently feel. I have really bad general anxiety and social anxiety, and I’ve also been diagnosed with OCD in the past. But I feel like OCD didn’t really fit in my experiences.

I think I’m in the phase where there’s just a lot of information, and I feel overwhelmed. My assessor gave me a list of book recommendations and a discord channel as well as some therapy options. I currently see a therapist, but she doesn’t specialize in autism or anything. I’m someone who gets very bogged down in research and details and right now I’m just feeling like there’s too much to look into. 

So I’m asking for one to two resources that you feel like really helped you the most when you were first diagnosed. For example, was there a blog post or an article that especially stood out to you? 

Thanks! And also I guess I’m a part of the community now lol ";;;;
2025-11-05 08:07:47;Does anyone else smile and wave TOO much?;"Hey all! 25F, diagnosed ADHD-PI, questioning autism. 

I do have a lot of typical traits like avoiding eye contact in protracted conversation, gullibility, taking things literally, being upset about spontaneous changes to plans/deviations from routine, etc, etc. However, when it comes to passersby, I always make eye contact, smile, and wave. In fact, I've been told I do it *too* much, or in situations where it's not necessarily appropriate (passing by strangers in a busy setting, for example, or during a tense moment). It's like instinct for me. I know it's considered nice and approachable to do these things in some settings (like when I'm at work), so it's like my brain has decided to ctrl+v it to every possible circumstance. 

I've discovered that I also do this with sneezing. If you sneeze, I *will* bless you. Even in the restroom, or during a big meeting, or if they're barely in range of hearing. I have been told this is weird. It feels like the opposite of what I've heard about a lot of autistic people, where they defy social rules, where I'm starting to realize I'm maybe a little too consistent about them, to the point where some people seem to be unnerved. 

Does anyone else relate to this? Is this antithetical to maybe thinking I'm autistic? Am I just overthinking a basic behavioral function? 

Thank you! ";;;;
2025-11-05 07:35:51;My Child With ADHD/Autism Is Acting Out on the Bus — Swearing, Hitting, and I Don’t Know What to Do;"*Update on today’s report from his teacher: He now called a child ugly which he’s never done and I don’t even think he actually understands what that means and he also tried to eat a piece of paper *wasn’t successful as the teacher made him spit it out*-he used to eat non food items when he was around 2-3 years old but hasn’t since so this is sorta new now at 6**

Ok, so this might be a little long so I apologize for that. My 6 year old son was diagnosed back in April with Autism (high functioning) and ADHD. Now, he shows more ADHD traits than he does Autistic traits. Ok, so I guess a little backstory:

\-He just start school this year (K), beginning had a few meltdowns about getting on the bus because he was scared (too loud - got him headphones). 

\-Things had been absolutely perfect for about a month and then he started getting bullied (physically mainly). 

\-Obviously we talked to the school and handled the situation. No more bullying. Ok cool. Only issue at that point was him not being about to keep seated in his own seat.

So now the current situation: 

\-About mid October, the bus driver started to let me know that he was still having a hard time staying seated (now hes in the aisle, now hes standing/crawling on the seats, etc.)... Here is the worst part and where im lost as to what to do: He is swearing (mind you, he does not swear at home or even in the school. It is ONLY on the bus). He started by telling other kids to ""STFU"", told another kid ""F\*\*\* you"" and gave the kid the finger. We have talked to him SEVERAL times about this and he seems to understand it but the next day he is doing it again. Now today the bus driver is telling me he is still swearing but now hes hitting kids with his lunch box as they get off the bus and he was hitting his seatmates (they're friends) fingers with his metal water bottle and made him cry. 

I dont know what to do, im truly lost. The school can only do so much when it comes to the bus and he also doesnt qualify for special transportation. ";;;;
2025-11-05 05:34:29;Male adult autistic dating is rough.;"Im high masking, and I'd like to be myself more around my dates.  The more I am myself the more I'm reminded that I'm different.  Im reminded how chaotic I am and I understand it's not for everyone.  It just cuts a little deep to be called psychotic for wearing a hand sewn leather hoody you made.  I'm sure there were other things 😅...
At least the date was in the woods and I was able to forage for mushrooms so I got that going for me....

I'm just trying to be myself, maybe find some company to not feel so lonely, but every so often getting called psychotic sucks... My diagnosis doesn't have psychopathy 🥲 

I'm torn between being myself on dates, or just masking more and not feeling so lonely for a little bit at a time.  I know I'm just another lonely autistic male looking for relatability.

Here's the offending jacket, it's made with recycled leather off a fb market place couch that I washed and re conditioned.";;;;
2025-11-05 05:12:59;Recently diagnosed after nearly ten years with same therapist and doctor!;Why would it take so long for my therapist and dr to properly diagnose me ?  10 years and I brought it up to my therapist last week and she agreed.  Why would they not tell me and what medications should I be taking? Currently on Prozac for depression.  Abilify for agitated.  Pregablin for anxiety.  Geeeeeez. Thank you to anyone who responds.  I'm overwhelmed and my brain is spinning. ;;;;
2025-11-05 04:51:58;Parents don't think I'm autistic so therapist says my test isn't valid .....??? [please read];"My therapist thought I was autistic so she got me an assignment where there were a bunch of different phrases describing behaviors, habits, patterns of thoughts, etc, and I had to mark/check what fit me. Doing it was a bit frustrating because it was very black-and-white and the answer couldn't be ambiguous but eventually I was able to do it all and hand it in. She asked my parents to do two of the same in regards to me and they did, so I turned that in too. 

In the next session, I came in and she looked at me weirdly with the tests in hand. She told me my results were a huge gap away from the results of what my parents marked. I thought that was obvious; My parents know nothing of my private life and barely paid attention to me in my childhood. She knew that. Except, she proceeded to completely disregard my test, and tell me I should stop searching for symptoms online, aka ”wanting to have autism”. I have 2 hours of phone a day, people. I never once told her I searched something online, rather, I just use what I believe to be the correct terms in psychology to refer to what I'm feeling. 

See the dialogue above.

”[...] I feel a huge disconnect between my mind, my body and the world. Sometimes it all seems like a dream, something like dissociation—”

”Dissociation? That only occurs in patients with PTSD. You don't have PTSD, do you? You know, I was treating a patient, a woman, whose toddler son her husband threw off of the 7th floor of their building. He died. She had dissociation episodes. She couldn't tell the world around her was actually real for months...(deep, kinda creepy stare into my soul)”

”Ahahah..oh..(awkward chuckle, what the hell am I supposed to answer to that?)”

”(Blinks) You think it's funny her child died?”

...So yeah. No way my first therapist is like that. I wish I could seriously get screened for autism but now I'm afraid my screening will get disregarded because I talk ”too pretentiously” or because my parents told them something completely different. My mom admittedly outright lies about my childhood because she doesn't want me to be diagnosed with anything. Help. 

I too think it MAY be unethical of her to tell me about that woman's trauma. I don't know. Am I wrong??? Also, a lot of others have presumed I was autistic, including actual doctors who only found out I was not when they mentioned my ”special needs” to my confused mom. ";;;;
2025-11-05 04:43:27;I think I'm autistic and am struggling. Help please?;"Hi Reddit.

I haven't posted much on here, and never in this forum, so please forgive any mistakes.

I'm fairly sure I'm autistic. Goodness knows I couldn't put a percentage on how sure, but the more I research or discover, the more it makes sense to me. I started researching after having a discussion about neurodiversity, and because we have a small person in the family showing signs of ADHD. In some ways I'm kind of hoping to get a positive diagnosis, because if I don't I wouldn't know why I'm feeling like this.

Here's where I need your help. What can I do to help relieve stress when I'm at work? I work in public services and have a VERY blunt colleague who (it feels to me) can find fault with anything. I feel like they think I'm stupid, though we have worked together long enough for them to attempt to understand me. I've told my manager that I'm seeking a diagnosis, and a member of my support team how I am feeling about all of this.

Any advice? Thanks.

Edit - I've bought a weighted toy for home, which I think is helpful.";;;;

2025-11-05 04:04:01;Why do Alistic people refer to themselves as Autistic ?;"        At this point, I can't even tell people I'm Autistic without them thinking I'm making some sort of joke about being incompetent. Half the time, I can't even tell that they're joking about having autism and I'm genuinely inclined to ask them about it.
        Is it rude to inquire about someone's diagnosis if they mention it ? It's not out of malice, I just really want to know if people actually have autism or are just fucking around. I don't want to come across as rude or offensive, but I want autistic friends, not people who joke around about it. 

Edit: I do not assume people are allistic, but there has definitely been an uptick of people (online and irl) who say they have autism as a joke or a synonym for stupidity.This is what prompted my post. Also, diagnosis means self diagnosis and medical. I realize I was nonspecific, but lots of people are jumping to conclusions about what I believe.

Sorry for the weird format, I've been informed it's because I indented my paragraphs. ";;;;
2025-11-05 04:02:06;Feeling invalidated as a late diagnosed level 1 with a level 3 sibling;"I am 26F and recently got my official diagnosis. I have a twin brother that was diagnosed at a young age with lvl 3. I still haven't told my parents and my side of the family (only my husband's side) about my diagnosis.

His case is the obvious one as he has intellectual deficits, regressed in learning as a  kid and checks all the most common criteria, is still living with my parents as he can't do most things by himself.

I was seen as the ""easy child"", I tried my best to not give more problems to my parents, always got good grades and didn't like breaking rules at all. I was called shy my whole life, didn't engaged much in conversations, was a very ""picky eater"" (now I know I have texture and sensory struggles). I did have some friends at school, but I always ended up ""losing"" almost every friendship I had over the years. I never fit well with the girls, I don't like make up, dresses, high heels (sensory related also). I was more into sports and gaming.

As a teen, my anxiety got really bad. But the timeline also collided with my brother starting to have recurrent violent meltdowns. So of course my parents where in a very bad place mentally. I was used to keep everything to myself, they never used to talk to me about feelings and more heavy topics. I more than once had to protect my mother from him when my father was still at work. I'm almost certain I got depressed at this moment of my life, but never got formal treatment. I kept my problems inside, and my grades high as usual. Eventually I think the adjustments with meds helped my brother have less meltdowns like that.

My anxiety (and maybe depression?) came to a point where I was breaking down, and I searched for answers on my own, until I found about Social Anxiety Disorder. So I just showed my mom the wiki page explaining about it while I was uncontrollably crying. Of course she was shaken, and tried to help me, talking about it with me (once, lol) and said they would find a psychologist for me. I went to a psychologist for some days, but eventually I gave up because I didn't know how to communicate with her, and I got terrible headaches after every consultation. My parents just accepted it and never talked about my problems again.

I graduated, went to college (still have to finish it) where I met my now husband, got a job (home office), but all this time I was still questioning myself about what is wrong with me. I quit my job to try to finish college and because I was on the verge of burnout. Last year I started thinking that maybe I also have autism, so I researched a lot and did some online tests and finally I went to a psychiatrist who tested me further and also came to believe I had social anxiety and also autism level 1.

It was a relief to receive the diagnosis and finally understand myself a little better. But now I'm kinda struggling about telling my side of the family because it's obvious they only consider lvl 3 and my parents believe that ASD now it is too ""stretched out"" to fit people that don't struggle that much as they think.

(English is not my first language, so excuse my errors!)

Have you told your parents/family and how did it go? Any advice?";;;;
2025-11-05 03:47:03;Parent not understanding?;Not sure how to describe this, or express how I feel but I’ve been recently diagnosed with autism (level one) and let my dad know because he kinda monitors my bank account and the evaluation did cost me a lot of money so he was asking why. Anyways I explained everything beforehand, so he knew there would be less in my account but he was still worried so I explained again and told him that I got diagnosed with autism. I have adhd as well and he was present for that diagnosis back when I was 12 (im 19f) idk if I’m explaining this properly but yeah he knows I have a mental disability but it isn’t treated as such. When I got my adhd diagnosis he didn’t really take the time to learn about how adhd affects people and what I needed, and I want him to understand autism. Is there any good resources to like show him an explanation? He won’t listen to me if I try to explain but if there is some super duper official source that explains what autism is and how it affects people I’m sure he’d change his mind. When he thinks of autism he thinks of the stereotype of nonverbal autistics and ones that stim a lot (I don’t mean this offensively) he just sees me masking and thinks “my daughter can’t possibly be autistic” does that make sense? I’m wanting him to understand the spectrum and how there are different levels, if there is some video I can link him explaining from one parent to another that would be very helpful. I’m sorry if this doesn’t fit guidelines or is inappropriate to ask;;;;
2025-11-05 03:33:13;Completely distraught after discussion about politics;"Hi, im (F25) not diagnosed yet but am going into assessment next week. I just need to vent for a bit bc I'm home alone and have nobody to talk to.

So I've been trying to make new friends and today I met up with someone (F30) through bumble friends. She's diagnosed with ASD and we were having a really good time and I really like her. But then she started talking about politics (we've just had elections where I live) and she was very passionate about it (which i can admire). But I don't have any interest in politics and I only somewhat follow it bc i dont want to not vote and i don't want to vote randomly. 

So her political views did not completely line up with mine and she's done much more research so I felt like i was at a disadvantage for defending my point of view. I promise I did do good thinking about my decision but after voting I just forget all about it and let it go bc I don't find it interesting. So I was completely unable to recall why I voted what I did and she made me feel really bad about it. She assured me she didn't think less of me and I believe her but I just felt very humiliated for having a different point of view, that i could not defend properly and felt like i was put on the spot. 

Now I just feel really bad and think of all these things I should have said. I can't stop crying and my heartrate is through the roof and I dont know what to do bc I did really liked her before and I want friends but she made me feel really bad. I just have a really hard time accepting that politics are not black and white at all and that makes choosing really hard and I feel like i can never make the right decision on it. So i usually try to not think about it too much bc it stresses me out but now I feel like this conversation has lead me into a negative spiral about my options and the world and politics and it feels like my head is going to explode.

Has anyone had similar struggles? I just want to feel less stupid right now 🥲";;;;
2025-11-05 03:31:44;How to be a better friend with my highly functional autistic female friend;"One of my closest friends is a highly functional autistic woman( is married has a really good job, can handle tasks and responsibilities). She is officially diagnosed and has told me openly about it. I don’t have an issue with this or accommodating things but I’ve started to notice some things that I know align with her autism and most likely due to being comfortable around me and I want to know if I need to be more understanding or if this is something that should be mentioned. 

She has, from the beginning, been very open about being picky with some food but is overall big on cooking and eating. Recently, it’s become more apparent she is highly highly critical of places to eat making it hard to go out to eat now. if anyone tries to make food or mention they are good at making a dish she will mention that she is the best at it and that she can make it and it’s dismissive. If we try to offer to bring food even as simple as mashed potatoes she still has a thing about how she makes them so well and hers are amazing ( applies to a lot of food). I realize this may not be intentional but it comes off really rude and a bit of a “I’m superior” thing and I know this can be her not registering this but I think people have shielded their thought on her cooking and now she feels she is the de facto person to cook bc she’s the best one at it. She is not, her food is good but it’s very specific and catered to her alone. While her food isn’t always good I try to be kind and complete it but I don’t think she would do the same or want to try anyone else’s because she does “it so much better, and I make it the best”. 

She has started to have more temperamental episodes with so many things, her anger and ability to handle internal conflict is dissolving. Kid at a restaurant when having dinner, too overstimulating and ruins everyone’s mood bc she’s feeling foul now. She didn’t like her food, foul mood. Her inlaws piss her off, foul mood and starts taking it out on her husband. This is one of the things I’m concerned about because of how she’s been reacting with her husband. Some of her behaviors, if the role were reversed, would be a big problem. they are starting to feel abusive and mean, it’s like he’s started to get beat down by her attitude. I’m aware they have a sensitive emotional range and things can be hard to regulate but some of this feels not right.  

When I see or hear her routines or mention something I do, she does the comparison thing which I get and am fine with but she tears yours down without realizing I think and then goes on about how hers is better. Only her routines and products can be the best and whatever you recommend is subpar and you will know it. Her hair is the best, her skin is softer, her makeup or her lack of it and why she doesn’t and how her way is better is inflated ego. I know I’m sounding like a broken record but she does this ego and superiority thing and it’s getting hard. 

Things just feel like they are going downhill. She has stated she is extremely smart and gifted and I while I do think she is smart, she is not in fact the smartest in the room and is combative with others who outshine her. She feels everything in her taste is the best and is superior. I think people have tried to be so nice and kind to spare her and it’s enabled a very self righteous and unaware person. The egotistical part of her starts to come out more and more. I know to a degree that some things may be harder for her to realize and be self aware about, but is this behavior being enabled or should something be mentioned. I just feel the mention response of things is just so touchy and unregulated that nothing good can come of it. Or maybe I’m completely wrong and I need to accommodate something’s more and understand her perspective differently. I know she tries to be a great friend and can be, I just think some self awareness and work might be needed on either side and I’m just not sure. I would include more specific details but they are so specific to her that I don’t want this to get back to her if she does frequent Reddit. Any questions or anything like that I can try and answer as best as I can without exposing too much. I just don’t want to be unsupportive friend and maybe need to employ some better understanding?

2025-11-05 03:18:58;Going through the stages of grief with my recent diagnosis is affecting me at work and today I cannot cope.;"I am newly diagnosed (M42) as of September though I think it’s more accurate to say that I’m finally trying to accept this reality. I was diagnosed twice in 2012/2013 with Autism and was so blindsided and angry about it that I refused to believe it and just kept pushing on as if nothing happened. I never even read what it meant at the time and have just stumbled along ever since.

Now that I’ve gone deep down the research hole for the past three months it’s so obvious that I’m finally angry. Logically I don’t see how anyone could have known when I was younger because Aspergers wasn’t even a diagnosis when I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and no one cared about all of these autistic things because they were happy with blaming everything on ADHD for everything I did even when it clearly made no sense. I’ve been laughing at all the awful situations I went through growing up because of this rather than being upset or mad.  All the misunderstandings, broken friendships, issues with boundaries, social isolation, it was all funny to me somehow. It’s finally hitting me and has changed into an unending slideshow of pain and loss.

I know they couldn’t have known but I’m really mad now. Mad at myself for not listening when I was told about this and being so dumb as to not even look up what it meant or even why they thought it. Mad at people around me for not saying *anything* about something being a bit “off” and feeling like it’s all just been in my head my whole life. I should be glad that my sister was accepting when I finally told her about my diagnosis a few weeks ago and at first it felt validating when she went on this rant about all the noises I made when I was younger and how it infuriated my parents. Instead I’m just angry, pissed off, I keep doing things and hear statements like “yeah I thought that was odd” or “yeah you do that all the time”… REALLY? I’m just hearing about this now?! Anytime I brought things up in the past it was just brushed off and ignored. I've felt like some kind of crazy alien and now you're telling me this stuff?!

So, I’m going through the stages of grief and this morning I woke up and it finally hit me like a truck. I really am autistic, and it really is disabling me and the constant reminders that were layers of validation are just painful now, every single one is a slap in the face.

I managed to go to work but halfway through my weekly meeting this morning I walked out and went to the bathroom. I just shut down. I was just crying silently frozen in place for at least 45 minutes. When I finally broke out of it and pulled myself together and got back to my desk I couldn’t work. I couldn’t focus, all I could do was stim uncontrollably. My legs were going crazy just shaking my desk and I was trapped in a rumination spiral so I after 10 minutes I just left. I tried to say something on the way out but I couldn’t talk so I just kept walking.

I’m home now just trying to process everything. I can’t even speak to my partner, I can’t even speak to myself in the bathroom. It’s like my chest seizes up or something the moment I try to talk, it’s so much right now!

I’ve been pretty accepting of this from a logical point of view and try to give advice or my experiences on here often but deep down I have not truly accepted this yet. I feel broken, absolutely broken. I know I’m not, and I’m just different and that’s ok, but I haven’t come to terms with this to stop feeling this way. I’m starting to believe I never will.

Today it is very clear to me how disabling my autism is and I am unraveling. I am so glad that I see my therapist tomorrow because today I just can’t cope.";;;;
2025-11-05 02:53:04;Why do I only recognise social situations- 6 hours later;"I’m 21, late diagnosed autistic.
But I’m getting so sick and tired of this now. I’m too anxious to go everywhere- I just think about how I’ve messed up everywhere.

Like I joke about my colleagues age a lot (as he’s worked for the company since before I was born) and I said it at the wrong time.

As a kid I always used to sit so close to people and my mum used to tell me off for it - and i understand now it makes people uncomfortable- but how close is too close ?
I also have auditory processing disorder so I can’t hear people if they’re too far away or I’m not facing them.

At school aswell - everyone had me sussed. And people would invite me to play fairies with them - and they’d tell me to stand under this magic tree to recharge my powers. And they’d leave me there all break.

As I’ve got older - I’ve tried to punish myself for missing social skills or being what neurotypicals call awkward. Or even if I’ve got overwhelmed in public I have consequences.

Whether that’s turning up the tens machine so it’s painful, or whether it’s not being allowed lunch, or donating something I really love.

But none of that’s seemed to work.
I don’t want advice on how to fix myself as that clearly hasn’t worked

But I can’t cope feeling like this anymore
Thanks guys ";;;;
2025-11-05 02:43:00;I had my diagnosis yesterday;"It was just... a little underwhelming, because as she pointed out, I will have already been sure about it myself.

But what got me the most, was the way she pointed out things about my communication style and my gestures that I thought were completely normal.

I finished the initial assessment and went into my husband and I just said, 'No way is she coming back with an ASD diagnosis for me. That was such a normal interaction, I aced everything, I was confident, comfortable with communicating my struggles with her, I was pleasant and smiled and I even looked at her.""

I was just so confident that I was wrong about myself.

Then she comes back a few hours later for my diagnosis call and she's like, ""So, you're absolutely Autistic. You ticked every box. Your hand gestures were off, your facial expressions did not match up with what you were telling me, you ignored every conversation starter that I introduced and your speech pattern and style is very typical of Autism.""

I was stunned. I did have an 'are you sure?' moment.

Overall, she was such a lovely assessor and now I feel I little guilty for not responding to her attempts at general conversation.

Now, I feel a little lighter. I feel like I can finally start understanding myself more.";;;;
2025-11-05 02:31:57;I need help from the AuDHD men so I can support my son better.;"I hope I’m in the right place. I accidentally posted this to my page, so I’m reposting here.
•••••••••

I’m Calling all AuDHD Men. I need info to help my son function better. 🥰

I’m autistic and ADHD so I have a crap ton of questions! 😆

So my son’s newest relationship didn’t work out (not a surprise really). He uprooted and left his routine and foundation to move to Florida. He had a classic meltdown there. It was ugly. And he drinks WAY TOO MUCH. And now he’s here, living with me and Paupi for the first time in over 20 years! Imagine an autistic, ADHD adult male struggling with relationships and, through routine and attachments, stayed attached with ALL the exes. 😬🫣 The new relationship was destined to break.

Me and my son have a tight bond. I’m recently clinically diagnosed AuDHD. He hasn’t been diagnosed yet, but it was recommended since he was in 3rd grade.

Sometimes, I know my kid better than he knows himself.

But what I don’t know or understand is this; how can I help him understand his uniqueness and learn to accept and pay more attention to his traits and triggers?

Autistic and ADHD men out there, I need your guidance.

* My son is 43
* Are you in a relationship?
* Have you ever been in a long term relationship (his longest is 13 years)
* What are your triggers (life and relationships)
* Do you have kids
* Do you find it hard to ask for help (like normal stuff, cooking, fixing something, or helping?)
* What do you struggle with most

The good thing is, he’s been here 2 weeks now and has not a single drink! He says he feels relaxed for the first time in decades. That’s good!

I really appreciate anything you can share. He’s a great kid, and I’d like to be more helpful while he’s figuring things out.

THANKS!

Oh. He’s 43. Has 6 kids. 😠 And one daughter was killed 2years ago by random gunfire.

2025-11-05 01:39:46;I thought I had to study for my autism evaluation but it was actually them studying me;"When I prepared for my autism evaluation I genuinely thought I had to get the answers right. I spent months reading about autism traits taking self-assessments and trying to make sense of my past. I thought if I explained everything clearly enough it would prove I was autistic

After the evaluation I realized something unexpected. The psychologist was not really testing my answers he was testing how I answered. It was not about whether I said yes or no it was about the way I thought through things how I described feelings and memories and how I processed social situations

I understood that I could not have masked that no matter how hard I tried. You can study the content of autism but you cannot fake the way your brain works when you explain something personal in real time

It made me reflect on why many of us feel like imposters after diagnosis. We think we performed autism too well or forced patterns to fit but the evaluator was seeing the natural patterns that we could not hide

Has anyone else felt like they were trying to pass a test only to realize the real test was how your brain communicates not what you memorized? (don’t discuss specific details from the assessment so this thread doesn’t get taken down)";;;;
2025-11-05 01:22:06;Would an autism diagnosis pre 2013 be equivalent to a level 2 diagnosis now?;"I was diagnosed as a kid at some point, I don’t know details because it was hidden from me but it was pre levels/pre removal of Aspergers. As far as I know I was diagnosed with autism not Asperger’s. Since it was hidden from me, I was “diagnosed” again as an adult, I say “diagnosed” because really it was just confirmed but I didn’t do the full eval because at the time I didn’t want a diagnosis on record. It was 2020 sooo you can imagine why I made that choice. I guess it’s on record out there somewhere anyways, but lost. But maybe my parents wouldn’t let it be official either so I don’t really know. 

Also I know it was for sure hidden from me because I remember an eval I took and no one would tell me me the results or what it was for and my parents deny that I ever took it. After that I went to therapy and later found out it was autism therapy. And after I got accommodations but people just said it was because my brain worked different. When I got the eval as an adult I took the paperwork for my mom to fill out and she said she didn’t need to do that because she already knew I was autistic :| 

Anyways I’m MSN but idk if I’m level 2 for sure and don’t want to say I am without knowing. I guess at some point I will get an evaluation again but I’d like to see where things go with the political climate first. Unless I end up having to cave to get some form of assistance. ";;;;

2025-11-05 00:02:57;I need help with my meltdowns;"Hi everyone, I really need some help and would love to hear from people who’ve gone through something similar.

I don’t have a confirmed diagnosis yet, but I’m currently under evaluation. One thing that’s been really confusing and exhausting for me are the meltdowns I have after arguments. They always come with a lot of physical intensity. My whole body gets tense, it feels like all my muscles want to explode. I start to disconnect from the present and mentally relive every other time it’s ever happened. It’s like all my past meltdowns come back at once, all mixed together.

I feel an overwhelming anger mixed with mental confusion, a strong sense of being misunderstood, of not being able to express myself the way I want. I get rude and irritated, then really sad because I don’t feel understood or comforted the way I need. Sometimes I don’t even know what I want, I just feel desperate for the pain to stop. It feels like my body is reacting on its own, as if it’s trying to speak for me. I sweat a lot, my heart races, I tremble inside and out, and I’ve even had red blotches appear on my skin. Sometimes I get the urge to hit things, but deep down I know that’s not what I actually want, it’s just an overload that feels impossible to contain.

I’d really like to know: do other people experience this too? Is it common for these meltdowns to happen after emotional conflicts, especially in romantic relationships?

People have always told me it’s an anxiety attack (I do have a GAD diagnosis), but I’ve had anxiety attacks before and they feel completely different. I’ve also had this type of crisis after disappointment, not finding something I was looking for, or sudden changes in plans, not always after arguments. As far as I understand, anxiety attacks are more about fear of the future, but when this happens, I’m stuck reliving all my past pain and meltdowns, repeating myself over and over.

If anyone could share how they deal with this, or what helps prevent it from happening, I’d be really grateful. I’d also love some advice for my partner, what can help in those moments, and what usually makes things worse?

This has been directly affecting my life and my relationship, and I really need to find a way to understand and manage these reactions better. Any experience, advice, or reading recommendation is more than welcome. Thank you so much for reading this far. ❤️

2025-11-04 23:43:49;Should I even try to get an official diagnosis? (TW: mentions of s//cide);"First off, I'd like to apologise if the formatting of this post is off as I'm on mobile. 

I'm new to the subreddit, so tell me if these kind of posts aren't allowed here. 

Should I even try to get a diagnosis for autism? I've started reading into neurodivergency (if that's the correct term for ASD, ADHD, etc), and I've found that I relate to quite a bit of what's written. I've also been struggling for the past two years when it comes to my mental health— and my grades are slipping despite studying. I'm tired of everything, and to be honest, I'm just exhausted of everything and everyone— and disappointed in how I turned out to be. 

It also doesn't help that apparently a doctor offered my mother the possibility of me being assessed for autism back when I was little— and now I wonder if there's even a point in trying to pursue that diagnosis. 

(Wasn't sure what flair to put here.)";;;;
2025-11-04 23:40:46;Anybody else late-diagnosed and *not* a gifted child or 2e?;"It feels like everybody I see who is late diagnosed was gifted or did well in school, and that’s part of why they weren’t diagnosed earlier. Which sucks, obviously. But I guess it’s, like, a reason? 

I barely graduated high school. Like really “summer school” “chronically absent” and “teachers got upset working with me to get me to a D minus“  barely graduated. After I got diagnosed (ASD level 1) they put me on meds for executive functioning and that helps a lot (I’m in college now!!) but my grades are still pretty bad, like C average. I try hard not to be jealous because being bad at school means I’ve developed an identity outside of academia, which I know a lot of “gifted” kids struggle with once they reach adulthood and it doesn’t matter anymore. But I’m still jealous a lot of the time because I spent my whole life being called stupid and lazy, and it feels like it would have been nice to at least be good at one thing. 

I don’t know. I was so obviously behind, I have no idea why nobody suspected it was developmental. I guess I just want to know if I’m the only one? ";;;;
2025-11-04 21:13:04;Does anyone else feel like autism is a double edged sword?;"I’m genuinely curious if anyone feels the same way about their diagnosis as I do?

On the one hand, I feel like certain aspects of autism have greatly benefited me. The gym and weight loss became special interests of mine so I lost 120 lbs back in 2019 and kept the weight off and I feel only neurodivergent people thrive in my field of work because I see all my neurotypical colleagues struggling.

On the other hand, I feel like a lot of autism symptoms have been an extreme detriment to both my mental health and all my romantic relationships.

Any opinions or insights from your own experiences would be appreciated. 🙏 ";;;;
2025-11-04 19:08:14;People are so mean and entitled;This is a rant. I was recently diagnosed with autism(high masking female) I also believe I have adhd. I have a tiktok account where I post about my experience and hyperfixations I don’t believe I have to explain why I do it. Anyway people are commenting all kinds of mean things like : if you’re posting this you’re not autistic, everyone’s a little autistic. Like the f***g entitlement of these people. I was late diagnosed and finally got answers for why my life was literal hell since very childhood and these comments just hurt me so bad. Just because I am conventionally attractive and am “low support” needs my struggles are dismissed, they are invisible. “all people are a little autistic” I HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED, I can’t leave the house by myself,  I am not able to pay my rent because of this and my day to day life is literal hell but yeah sure everyone goes through that. I know I shouldn’t pay attention but it’s impossible. I would never dismiss anyone’s struggles. ;;;;

They're great if you're questioning whether you're autistic sure but mostly I believe they just make people like me feel like crap.

I have an official diagnosis, and yet, whenever I watch those videos, I never seem to meet their standards. Some of them, I'm sure, are just made really badly, but even with the more common presentations of autism I am still not ""autistic enough"" to them it seems. 

I have a history with self-doubt and they do not make me feel satisfied that the people around me are correct, that I am autistic.

Has anyone else had this issue? Or am I just really unstereotypically autistic (or misdiagnosed, but that's the disorder/mental health-imposter-syndrome talking)?

2025-11-04 18:03:07;Masking as different people;Hey! So I’m not diagnosed as of yet, in the process of waiting for an assessment. However I’ve been doing therapy around masking.

If so how do you come with it? ;;;;
2025-11-04 17:14:57;Is it true?;"Is it true that when you're autistic you don't feel the need to socialize with others? The psychologist told me that lol...  
Because I told the psychologist that I was always withdrawn in social interactions, and I would often play by myself. But I also told him that I actually wanted to join these children, I was just afraid, unexperienced what to say and sensitive to potential rejection.  
By the way, my sister got recently diagnosed with ADHD.  
And because there is schizophrenia in my family, he suspected that I could have schizotypal personality disorder. But I actually feel emotions and sometimes too much. I don't think I experience paranoia, but yes, I got many unwanted thoughts and the anxiety around being observed (it stopped eventually), but I knew it was just an anxiety.  
And I like socializing, but with like-minded individuals the most (I mean shared interests).  
I told him that sometimes I felt like I was the fictional character with which I was obsessed at the time, but I knew I wasn't this character, I was just playing/masking, because it was hard for me to be myself in social situations.";;;;
2025-11-04 16:47:41;Does anyone else get mad when people try to help?;"F20, recently diagnosed with autism

I don't know if this is linked to autism and I can't find anything on this specific circumstance.
Sometimes I get in moods where I feel as if absolutely nothing can help me, but all I want is help and advice. But then when I ask for help, every suggestion I get makes me even more frustrated and sad. My mom is the one who sees this the most and she is an angel and has so much patience with me. I tell her I'm sad or overstimulated and I don't know what to do. She'll suggest I engage with one of my special interests, do a grounding technique (breathing, music, journaling), redirect the convo to distract from my thought spiral, or give solutions to whatever is upsetting me the most. But to every single thing she throws at me, I get more upset because I don't want to do any of it or believe nothing will help. 
It makes me feel so disconnected from myself, I feel like a difficult person because she is trying her best to help me with things that have helped a lot in the past, but I am defiant towards everything and only see the worst in each solution.
Sometimes I even get angry at the other person because I feel like I'm getting ""proof"" that no one can help me or understand me.

Generally when I'm in this mood the only way it ends is by me breaking down because I'm so confused with myself or I shut down and feel super depressed.

Does anyone else experience this, know why it happens, or have tips?";;;;
2025-11-04 14:54:47;I have been diagnosed with autism and I am beyond angry;"I was diagnosed that I am on the spectrum. I was asked if I wanted to take the test, and I agreed just so the dr would stop asking me and hopefully this test would help them diagnose me better with my depression/anxiety. I never in my life for a moment thought I was. Also, according to the depression/anxiety questionnaire I took it put me in 2+ standard deviations for depression. I cannot accept these results of me being on the spectrum. I want to go over with the dr what actions/behaviors put me in a category over the other. However, I would need to wait a few weeks to see them. The dr was reluctant to share numerical data of the results and I converted the conversation into what I can do improve my weak areas; I identified that the conversation wasn't productive so I aimed at a more productive session. The dr appeared to go back and focus on what my area of weakness are instead of how to fix or improve them. I am not seeing my dr for some time due to them being away. I went over the test in my head, I wrote out what I remember and nothing felt abnormal from my point of view except one moment because I felt anxious and awkward during the test because I was given a task and focusing/concentrating on the task and their attempt to socialize confused me. Eventually in the following attempts I always responded back to them.

I am really angry, and even more depressed than ever about this diagnosis.

I am trying to figure out how can I disprove this test in a non-biased way.

I am so angry it's unbelievable. I was 100% positive the test would be fine, and I was excited for the test like a fun a problem-solving event or challenge. I was looking forward to getting real help in dealing with anxiety depression. Instead I got hit by something unimaginable to me.

It honestly feels like those movies 'go to a psych ward using your free-will to be trapped inside of it forever.'

I don't know why, but I don't know how I can trust my dr when I strongly believe their diagnosis is wrong. I know they are a dr with a PhD but even so, the test is 'subjective,' and at the same time it's a 'gold standard.' Somehow it's both subjective and objective at the same time.

I also think i bombed the AQ portion because the whole questionnaire is stupid. So many of the questions needed a middle answer instead of either side.


I have no-one in the world to talk to. I am really angry that my whole reality as a whole has been shifted dramatically.

Any kind words of encouragement are appreciated. I was trying to get my bearing straight while having a heavy depression, to be blind sided by something that changes my world view of myself entirely for my present self and all of my existence up to now.

edit 1: I did my best to read most of the comments (around 50-80% before refreshing my page even once). Probably took me 3-4 hours. Now I am going to reply to anyone who replied to me. Despite what many were saying, I am not trolling. Some saying 'this is the most autistic post,' gave me a chuckle I didn't take it to heart or seriously those statements.

edit2: I am surprised how much of attention this received. I get the gist of it, I feel a lot better now. Not out of the woods but in a more accepting state of what is likely to occur. I appreciate everyone's attempt to engage this post. Some made me laugh, most of you were kind and shared a piece of your life experience with me. I am grateful for such kindness. I will continue to keep reading and responding occasionally; there is simply a lot of responses to read.";;;;

2025-11-04 11:00:37;Being Autistic Makes Me Feel Stupid.;"I (21f) am so tired of being autistic. I hate it so much. I apologize for the format of this post, I’m writing this while on the verge of a meltdown.

I used to be the far above average student. I always had to try harder than others, but in high school (despite missing ~half of my entire high school career due to physical disabilities) I achieved top marks in almost all my classes. 

I’m now in what is technically my third year of university and I’m drowning. I experienced a traumatic experience my first year that left me with PTSD and agoraphobia, and on top of that have struggled with obtaining my accommodations (despite being diagnosed as neurodivergent in grade school). I’ve just transferred universities this year and despite my best efforts, I feel like I’m too stupid to be a successful student- and my parents somewhat agree. I’ve always dreamed of graduating university (with multiple degrees) and have worked my ass off to get where I am (let alone survive), I want nothing more than to achieve my dream- but every time I do work I have meltdowns for a million reasons. Even though I know what I’ve learned and could speak to someone about it in a conversation, the tests and assignments cause me to get anxious and when I’m anxious my working memory depletes which just results in a violent cycle of forgetting, doubting, and hating myself. 

I hate having autism. I don’t understand why people want to have this developmental disability. I would pay any amount of money to fix myself and just be normal. It isn’t some special prize or superpower. Every single thing I do is far more challenging for me than it is for any of my peers despite my iq being over 130. Life is horrible and I don’t even know what to do anymore. 

I hate being a failure. I hate having a developmental disability.";;;;
2025-11-04 10:59:06;Thoughts on neglectful men that are also autistic?;"Hi! I’m a late diagnosed autistic woman (26F) I am reflecting on my 2 exes after a recent breakup. I think me and my exes all recognized with each other that we were autistic without having or knowing much about the label. I think relationships automatically unmask you. 

I am wondering if you guys have experienced seemingly autistic men who you realized after the fact were toxic, emotionally unavailable (avoidant) inconsistent, neglectful and mean when you weren’t feeling your best.

I’ve noticed I become dysregulated when my relationship feels imbalanced. It’s hard for me to figure out how much of my exes behavior was them being dysregulated and what part is straight up narcissism. ";;;;
2025-11-04 10:40:33;When did it finally “click” with you?;"What I mean is when did you finally realize you do indeed have autism and what best works for you and your life? I ask this question because I was diagnosed at 13 or 14 (can’t remember exactly) and just recently at 21 did I finally realize what I needed to do so I can have the best possible chance of success. Like I’ve always known I was different and when I was diagnosed with autism it did make sense to me, but I really never took advantage of that diagnosis. I never seriously thought “what could I do as someone with autism to help myself” I instead never thought about it in depth and instead continued on miserable and in constant agony. 

Recently I found if I set a routine and follow through with it I’m much happier and more productive. I’ve always tried doing it but people need stuff and so I would always change it and just go with the flow. I am to put it lightly… NOT someone who can do that. I thought I was, I wanted to be, but it never clicked to me that I would be in agony if I did so. I don’t need the strictest routine but a general guideline that I follow most of the time keeps me happy and less likely to burn out. My needs matter and if I don’t meet my needs I realized I become mean and angry, which in turn hurts others around me. 

I’ve always felt scared to tell people what I need, and no one would really listen to me when I did anyways, so I just kinda shut it down and tried pushing on, even if it hurt me greatly.  It feels silly it took me so long to truly listen to what I needed. So I’m curious if anyone else realized later on what they needed and that it was ok to ask for said things. I hope I’m making sense cause I feel like I’m yapping nonsense right now haha. 

TL;DR It took me a long time to realize what I needed to do to help myself succeed in life, and realize that I am someone who struggles with things most others won’t. I’m happier finally realizing my own needs and how to be the best me I can be. ";;;;

Given the high genetic likelihood of having an autistic child, I want to be prepared with coping with her needs and ours. I don't want our child to experience the same childhood stressors that we did, especially as she gets older.

(For example, I had an intense phobia of the wind and loud noises growing up and was often told to ""get over it."" Now, I realize it was overstimulating to me and causing profound anxiety.)

Honestly I may or may not actually be autistic, but regardless I relate very deeply to the female autistic experience and meet much of the criteria. As I’ve gotten older, social interaction has gotten so much harder. I barely managed to get through a rigorous degree at a prestigious university (that’s what made me actually suspect I might be autistic), and now it seems like it was all for nothing. I wasn’t able to form connections with my instructors or network with alumni and staff. My grades were lackluster because I had such a difficult time adapting to college. I basically just have a piece of paper with my name on it. I already struggle SO MUCH with job interviews because I’m so shy and I really just don’t get what they’re wanting to hear and see. It doesn’t matter how much I prep and memorize my answers, I’m just so off putting and awkward in the interview room. All of my peers have fantastic first jobs and are at the start of their careers. I’m having to work at a retail store because it was the only job without a face to face interview (nothing wrong with retail, just feels like a step backwards after working for a Bachelor of Science). I just feel directionless and worried that I’ll never have a career because I just can’t come across as a “normal” person. I hate having to pretend with my family and friends like I’m just taking my time and thinking about my options, because if I’m being honest, it seems like I have no options.;;;;
2025-11-04 08:20:40;Is taking things literally a bad thing?;"Hello everyone I’m new to the community and Reddit in general so please excuse whatever parts of this don’t make sense. I a 22(F) was recently diagnosed with Audhd. I’ve been in therapy for many years and recently switched to a provider that has a background in helping autistic clients. 

Recently a close friend told me it made them angry that I always take things literally. They expressed they feel difficulty communicating their emotions and my lack of reading between the lines and asking questions puts them in a corner. This shocked me to realize a part of myself I didn’t view as a “bad” thing bothered them so much. 

My question is, should I be striving to change how literally I interpret things? Have other people navigated a similar situation, if so how? ";;;;
2025-11-04 07:49:25;Autism and anxiety diagnosis. How do I know if the things I'm anxious about are actually realistic?;"Newly diagnosed adult autistic here.  I also got diagnosed with anxiety.  I tend to overthink things, which is the main cause of my anxiety.   

I recently applied for a lateral transfer at my work, for a job that I very much wanted.  I was concerned about being declared redundant, despite my supervisor, HR, my therapist, and at least three colleagues telling me that this isn't a realistic fear.  I applied and was super excited, only to pull my application at the last minute due to a panic attack over being declared redundant.  

I am very mad at myself and knew then that I  needed to get my anxiety under control.  I was diagnosed with autism and anxiety.  

So my question here is this:  How do you know when the fears caused by your anxiety disorder are actually unreasonable, and when they're logical?

For example, the idea of driving drunk gives me anxiety over what could happen if i do it, and therefore I don't drink and drive.  This is a perfectly valid fear that prevents us from doing something risky.  Some fear is healthy and keeps us safe. 

So how do you know when something you're stressing about is unrealistic fear deriving from your disorder, and when it's a valid reason to stress out?  How do we avoid making bad choices and ignoring legit warnings?";;;;
2025-11-04 07:48:19;Is it just me or do I find people on here with Asperger’s who got married were diagnosed AFTER they got married?;"I know it’s a strange question to say, but I’ve noticed on quite a few responses on posts on this subreddit when it comes to dating that lots of people only found out that they had Asperger’s after they got married. 

Is this just a coincidence or is this some sort of evidence that it tends to be harder to get married if you know you have Asperger’s compared to if you don’t? I’d like to hear your thoughts.";;;;
2025-11-04 07:44:51;I opened myself up and got rejected. I don't know how to feel right now.;For obvious reasons no point in saying any names. I was hanging out with my boyfriend and his friend, he's been friends with for over 10 years. I feel that I am autistic. I am 95% sure anyway. A diagnosis right now is hard for me, money is tight and everything. We were playing call of duty. I was genuinely enjoying myself, but I usually hide my kiddish talk and child sounding voice that I sometimes do, for anyone but certain people, my boyfriend included. His friend who I wanted to open up to. Texted him and basically said do I always talk this way or just because I'm tired. It hurt. I don't know where to go from here. Part of me knows to not open up to him anymore but he's important to my boyfriend. You know? Any advice? I try to not let that side of me out but it sometimes just takes more energy that I don't have to use. My boyfriend talked to me and doesn't fully understand why I do it. I try to tell him, but he just reassures me he isn't leaving me and he loves me. He said I can just do it with him. It just hurts. I want to be myself but getting shut down sucks. The only other people who let me unmask without judgement are not my friends anymore. ;;;;
2025-11-04 07:41:38;"Is the term ""skill regression"" ableist?";"I (31 F) am in graduate school for social work. I am late-diagnosed autistic/ADHD and my goal is to work almost entirely with autistic/other neurodivergent adult clients doing psychotherapy in a neurodiversity-affirming way, as there are almost no autistic therapists in my town. 

I had a supervisor sit in on a session with one of my clients to supervise me as part of my placement training. This supervisor has ADHD but not autism, and is quite passionate about using a neurodiversity-affirming approach with her clients. In the session, I used the term ""skill regression"" with my client, who had previously used the term to describe what they were going through after a period of burnout. I have used this term in my own life and with other clients, I have seen many autistic people talk about it online, and it genuinely seems like a realistic term to describe what happens when one goes through autistic burnout.

Afterwards, my supervisor was going over the session with me and recommended that I describe ""skill regression"" in a ""more neurodiversity affirming way"", like ""temporary skill loss due to burnout"" or something similar, as it might make the client feel less hopeless or like their skill loss is permanent. I felt comfortable enough to let her know that I disagree, as it's not the term itself that can make people feel hopeless, its a lack of support and understanding. In my opinion, the term itself is not inherently ableist, it's literally just describing what is happening. And I had previously made sure I clarified with the client what their definition of the term was so that we had a shared understanding of the fact that skills can be re-built, but often in a more sustainable and accommodating way. My supervisor understood my perspective, but I still felt like she was not fully on board with me using that term.

What are people's opinions of this term? Has it been helpful to you? Has it ever made you feel hopeless?";;;;
2025-11-04 07:23:32;autism vs ptsd symptoms;"hey all!

i was recently diagnosed with a few mental disorders (including depression + adhd) and have been going to therapy.

ive realized in therapy the amount of ptsd symptoms i have like constant dissociation, always uncomfortable around people, always locking bedroom doors, etc.

my therapist highly suggested i should look into ptsd (or more likely cptsd), but ive had a lot of issues identifying trauma that could have caused it.

ive also looked a lot into autism, especially since my recent adhd diagnosis, and I really really resonate with a lot of the symptoms.

so I was wondering, can autism (specifically undiagnosed, im 21 currently), cause ptsd-like symptoms? as in masking + fear of being perceived?

thank you!

tldr - can autism cause ptsd symptoms like dissociation and feeling of not being safe around people";;;;
2025-11-04 07:13:27;Should I stop seeking an evaluation?;"Sorry for two posts in one day. I just had a meeting with my therapist that was a little mildly upsetting but I’m also ok to listen to her if it’s the best thing. I’m 26 female. 

She said she didn’t know but she mostly disagreed with an autism diagnosis for me. I’ve been seeing her for a couple of months now. This was the first time I brought up me wondering about autism. Most of it has been focused on past family issues and ocd, which she thinks my social awkwardness and anxiety stems from. (I’ve managed the OCD enough now that it can be more of an annoyance than anything. ) 

She asked me questions like if I walked on my toes as a kid or flapped my hands or struggled with suddenly feeling uncomfortable in a piece of clothing. I mentioned I did remember walking on my toes sometimes but idk if it was very frequent… probably not. I would just randomly spin in my room sometimes in middle school because it was fun. Some of the people I hung around with in middle school liked to joke about how I flapped my hands sometimes when I got excited but she said if it was because of autism i would do it when I was anxious… which I didn’t really. 

I know sometimes people have an outdated version of autism in their heads especially for women. I don’t know if this is one of those cases or if I should listen to my therapist? I otherwise like her a LOT, even though she doesn’t do the best therapy for OCD, but I knew she wasn’t an OCD specialist. She’s not an autism specialist either. I still feel inclined to think I may be on the spectrum and want to ask/ see a specialist for an evaluation. But I also don’t want to seem a little delusional.

This is all very hard. I’m just wondering about your honest thoughts. I asked if I could create a list of the behaviors I thought might suggest autism and bring it to my next appointment with her and she said that would be ok. ";;;;

2025-11-04 06:09:01;Was told I'm ineligible for having autism and was denied services. Extremely frustrated.;"(Update: [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/s/TptFN8PvJL) comment addresses FAQ's in the replies. I will be blocking anyone that tries to be weirdly passive aggressive about being self diagnosed or just overall rude. Curiosity is fine, but don't be mean about it.)

I'm 19F and I've been waiting for my autism diagnosis for a year due to not having enough money ($1.2k-$3k) to order one on my own. I just read my psychological evaluation and am extremely frustrated/dissapointed. I'm applying for college this year and desperately need disability accommodations to survive due to the fact I'll be living in the dorms on my own, so the fact I've been barred from that makes me want to scream.

For context, I've suspected I have autism for the past three years. It started back in mid 2022-early 2023 when I started looking back at my childhood and realizing how difficult high school was and how ""different"" I felt from others. I'm black with diagnosed ADHD and live in a predominantly mid-sized white town too, so it especially didn't help.

During the evaluation, I talked about these specific things that have me *convinced* I'm autistic:

- My special interest is in art. (more specifically the art fundamentals, but thats not important—) I had specific moments where I would go 24-72hrs without eating because I only wanted to intake as much information about art as possible and only draw for long periods of time. It was very hard to pull me away from my phone.

- I struggle with showers/hygiene overall due to sensory issues and struggles with keeping a routine due to my adhd. This was actually something I talked about in my assessment. I have issues getting in the shower consistently because of the tempature difference when you get in vs when you get out. I can't STAND the cold air on wet skin and how much it fucks with my body. So to compensate, I take ""partial"" showers. I grab a washcloth, wet it and just scrub where I need to. Plus, it's very low energy. Instead of being in the shower for thirty minutes dreading to get out. I deal with a mild cold breeze and am still *somewhat* clean. A win is a win.

- During high school (2019-2023), I was taking college classes along with my hs classes. At the time, I was also in an abusive relationship and a toxic friend group that enabled my ex's actions. (We were all in this friend group together.) He was incredibly emotionally abusive/unintelligent and at times genuinely made me consider suicide. At the time I didn't know it, but they were *heavily* contributing to my terrible mental state ON TOP of the multiple classes. 2022-2024 was the year I crashed and struggled with severe autistic burnout. I had virtually no energy and couldn't even get up to eat, even if I desperately wanted to. My unmedicated executive dysfunction from my ADHD at the time *especially* didn't help. I was constantly called ""lazy"", ""stinky"", etc. from my mother because I couldn't even begin to explain the mental anguish I was going through, nor could she be bothered to understand me. Thankfully I left this friend group in Jan 2025, but being surrounded by others who also weren't anything like me (adhd + autism) made fitting in with others in real life extremely difficult.

- I have echolalia and repeatedly stim, I just mask so heavily it's hard to tell. I was reading my evaluation and I noticed a lot of comments about my appearance. How I was ""well kept"", ""didn't fidget"", etc. I even told myself beforehand to unmask as hard as I could and I just... couldn't. When I'm around other I'm comfortable with, it's very easy for me to do that. The psychologist just... missed that, I guess???

- I have severe auditory sensory issues. I need my noise canceling headphones to survive. I hate the sounds of loud motorcycles, trucks, ppl screaming, etc because it overstimulates me to all fucking hell. It's agony. I apparently qualified for this during the assessment tho.

- For a while, I had a very specific routine with food. I always had to eat 20 grapes with 10 orange slices exactly and yogurt. Why did the fruit have to be even you ask? Because with every two grapes, I wanted one orange slice. It's perfect. But the problem is that not every orange comes with ten slices, nature is weird. So I got really upset if my orange came with 9 slices or 11 slices because then I had to get an odd number of grapes to compensate, put three grapes in my mouth and *one* orange slice, or end up with more grapes and no orange slices or vice versa. I had this specific routine for months and it only stopped because either we didnt get grapes/oranges from the store or I found a new thing to be fixated on due to my ADHD and I cared more about the new thing than my orange/grape fixation.

So— thats most of it. Apparently the only things I qualified for was: 
- Defecit in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships
- Hyperreactivity to sensory input/aspects in my environment

Somehow, I didn't qualify for ""Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity"" because, and I quote, ""Her current interest in art did not appear clinically significant in its intensity""

...So we're just gonna ignore the part when I said i wouldn't get up to eat for DAYS because I was so focused in art? I'm more upset that they were focused on my *current* obsession with my special interest rather than how obsessed I was with it in the past. Although it was two to three years ago when I brought that up, it's still *really* important— no?

Anyway, I somehow only qualified for two out of the seven criteria that need to be met to qualify for ASD and to get services from this place. I got a bunch of papers in the mail including a lot of appeal forms and I don't know what to do... I seriously need advice. I got a Representative Authorization Form, a Notice of Action (NOA), Lanterman Act Appeal Request Form, Notice of Resolution (NOR), Appeals Process Timelines, The Lanterman Act Appeals Information Packet, and Your Appeal Rights in the Lanterman Act. I've been looking for a job for a year and a half and have had no luck. I wish I could pay for my own assessment from a different place but I seriously doubt it. What do I do?

This is my first time ever getting an assessment and also my first reject and I feel way too young for this lmao. IDK how to adult yet. Someone help. ;__;

2025-11-04 05:24:15;SAHM undiagnosed and struggling;"Hello. I'm a 34ish yo SAHM with three kids. My oldest is diagnosed ADHD and we suspect also autistic. At this point I am positive I am autistic but dont know if I can get a diagnosis due to finances or what good it would do me at this stage. 

Lately I have been having really intense anxiety attacks regarding my financial contribution to our family. Being a stay at home parent has saved us a ton of money overall, as my possible pay from a job in our county would cover daycare and basically nothing else. Now that our youngest is a year away from starting preschool I am looking into part time work to try and help contribute financially to our family. 

I'm so scared and anxious. I've been at home with my babies and kids since 2017 and so dedicated to their care. I want to be available for them if they are sick or during school breaks, and don't know what sort of job would support that. I could apply for a part-time position as an aid at a school, but I did that before my oldest was born and it was so draining and I gained almost a hundred pounds because we fell into just eating out due to exhaustion. My husband and I think of possible jobs and my brain immediately panics and inserts reasons they are unsafe options. I am a very talented crocheter and seamstress, but don't know if I could turn those hobbies into a side hustle that I could maintain or that would compete with the creators on sites like Etsy. 

I've been in a cycle of thinking of solutions --fear and self doubt -- burnout for months. Does an official diagnosis actually help late-diagnosed adults? Is it worth the thousands of dollars I see on every website I find that offers adult diagnosis in my state? I feel so stuck. ";;;;
2025-11-04 05:20:23;Diagnosed vs clinically diagnosed?;"Okay, so bear with me. I feel a bit stupid about even having to ask this, but figured since several have been diagnosed here, perhaps this would be a good place for insight. 

I (F) was diagnosed at place called Psychological Associates of (Location) I was seen by a psychologist who specializes in assessment of ADHD & ASD at 32yr. 36yr currently. 

My diagnosis is not on my medical chart and I’ve really not minded with the political climate these days in the USA on the topic of ASD. A year or so ago I began to question if my diagnosis is then not official? Is there a difference between my method of diagnosis and being clinically diagnosed? Is this why it is not on my medical chart/in my medical records? 

Are their perks to not having my diagnosis listed, vs them being listed? My middle child was also diagnosed at 13yrs. This diagnosis came prior to mine and was the cause for my suspicions for myself and led to my own diagnosis. My child had different psychologist, but within the same Psychological Associate’s building. My child’s diagnosis is also not listen in the medical chart or in the medical records. 

Thank you for any information anyone can offer";;;;
2025-11-04 05:04:23;What would you wish your parents had said and done?;"So my 9 year old son was just diagnosed with AuDHD. 6 months ago I would never have guessed it.

We obviously want to help and support him the best we can, and we are looking to see what kind of support we can get him in school (we are not in the US).

But I would love to ask this community: what did your parents do that was awesome growing up?  Or what would you wish they had done?

2025-11-04 04:45:43;Bullet Journal for severe burnout??;"Hello all, thanks in advance for any advice on this. I have been in a severe autistic burnout since August 2024, and likely a less severe burnout for the previous couple of decades before that. I wish I was exaggerating. 

I am diagnosed AuDHD + anxiety, depression, CPTSD and narcolepsy.

I only received the AuDHD diagnosis a couple of years ago, so I’m still working on integrating that.

So that’s just a little bit of background. The upshot is I am in a desperate state trying to recover from burnout to some level of functionality. 

I am overseas from my home country of origin and I do not really have any support, emotionally, friendship-wise, or family, etc.

Technology/social media/screens are certainly not doing me any favors of course.

And every time I look at my calendar on my computer, I almost bottom out from the backlog of things I haven’t done for over a year now, after decades of masking and being highly functional on the outside while crumbling inside. 

So I’m thinking maybe bullet journal could be a good solution in terms of bringing me away from screens and  back to pen to paper but at the same time just doing the bare minimum of day-to-day life i.e. brushing my teeth showering getting myself fed is about all I can handle and I’m sinking fast.

TYIA for any reflections or thoughts or guidance. Particularly curious if anyone has tried this specifically for burnout. But very grateful for any feedback.";;;;

My mum (42F) keeps telling random family members and friends about my diagnosis, I personally have only told the people that are closest to me and that I feel like need to know. I haven’t communicated to her that I don’t want her to tell anyone as she didn’t initially go around telling people and was very understanding as to why I’m not “shouting it from the rooftops” but now she keeps dropping into random conversations with people when they talk to her and specifically ask how she is doing.

She is in search of a weighted stuffed animal. I knit both of these chickens. I tried to make the giant one into a weighted animal by filling it with 11 lbs of chains wrapped in stuffing, which is about as comfortable as it sounds. An absolute reject as an Emotional Support Chicken but it was fun to make. I could try to stuff it with weighted beads but I think my daughter finds the chicken itself texturally offputting.

 I keep getting targeted ads for weighted Highland Cows and weighted sloths. If you have a weighted stuffy that you love, can you share the brand if that's allowed?  
Many years ago I made her a weighted blanket. I broke at least 7 sewing machine needles and it was a total ordeal, sewing a stuffy is just completely out of my league.

2025-11-04 00:52:09;Got diagnosed with Asperger's at 40. It reframes my entire life of trauma, gambling addiction, toxic relationships, and career burnout.;"Hi Reddit. I wanted to share my story in case someone else is in the same boat. I've felt ""different"" my whole life, like I was playing a game without knowing the rules. Now, at 40, I have an official diagnosis: Asperger's Syndrome (with a suggestion of co-occurring ADHD).
This isn't an excuse. It's the user manual I never received.
Looking back, everything clicks into place:
Childhood: I grew up in an alcoholic home. I was analytical in school but had coordination issues (dyspraxia) and was a loner. My literal thinking made me the butt of jokes.
Burnout: I tried studying system-based fields (Math, Mechanics), but the social chaos and pressure led me to a breakdown and a psychiatric hospital.
Addiction: After the hospital, I spent 3 years in isolation and fell into a gambling addiction. For me, it wasn't about money—it was about finding a system. I was trying to analytically ""crack the code"" of the chaos, which was a destructive coping strategy.
Relationships: I stayed in toxic relationships (with a girlfriend I felt ""too weak"" to leave) and had ""friends"" who disappeared when I was hospitalized. My logical, principled understanding of friendship didn't match their world.
Work: I was the office ""scapegoat."" My literal way of speaking and need for logic clashed hard with office politics.
Turning Point: An HIV diagnosis forced me to finally accept myself and my orientation.
The combination of ASD + trauma (C-PTSD) is the key. It explains why I was so prone to burnout and addiction. It's terrifying to think how much of my life I lost wandering in the dark, but it's also a massive relief. I finally understand. I'm starting over, but this time,I hope I have a map.

EDIT (A reward for reading this far): A perfect example of my ASD logic from kindergarten.
The teacher told the class that if anyone farted, they had to leave the room. One day, I farted. So, following the rule, I just stood up and walked out. The teacher, confused, asked why I was leaving. I told her the truth: ""Because I farted."" All the kids burst out laughing. I had no idea what was funny—I was just following the instructions. The irony is, by being the only one who obeyed, I was also the only one who didn't have to sit in the smell...

2025-11-04 00:25:40;Question about preparing for Referral/Evaluation;"So I am very far off from being able to get evaluated but I wanted to ask - would putting together a bulleted history of myself help?? I don’t want to research anything because I don’t want to sway anything and I tend to over-research, but if I try to just list areas of why I am concerned in each part of my life from being young to now? I don’t want to go overly crazy with it and will try to keep it short. I just expect that my primary care doctor, and then after I can get a referral, the examiner, will have questions on why I am pursuing a diagnosis as a 26 year old woman. I thought maybe a bulleted history would help? 

I’m a bit worried about pursuing an evaluation anyways and wondering if I am just being silly. Years ago when I was like 20 I researched a ton of autism in women and presented a big list (I’ll try not to go so crazy this time - just want to make a concise list) to a therapist I was seeing at the time on talkspace. The therapist told me that they thought that I couldn’t be autistic because I expressed myself too well and too much to be autistic. So I stopped looking into it. But I think this may be because of an outdated idea of autism??

Just wondering what you all think. I keep thinking about all of this stuff. As my husband says, I am getting quite “fixated”. Trying not to post too much on here. Maybe this is all silly, idk.

2025-11-03 22:59:16;Immigrating to Australia with an autism diagnosis;"Hi!  
  
I’m 16F from the UK, and I’m planning to move to Australia (If everyone goes to plan) in my late 20s. I have family who immigrated in the early 2000s. It was my aunt, uncle, and their two kids. Now aged,  Aunt: 51, Uncle: 49, Cousins: 27M & 30D. My cousin, M, now has two little Aussie kids of her own with her husband (who’s a fully fledged Aussie). My uncle and my cousin D are both electricians/engineers who have a 2 week away, 2 week home schedule.  (Hopefully this background info makes some sense/can help)



I was diagnosed autistic back in 2022 when I was 13, and have started getting disability benefits directly to me since May of this year. Although, my family and I believe this to be a misdiagnosis (of possible C-PTSD as my childhood was practically in hell.. And still is, but I’ll not get into that). I’m very much mild in my autism, and the only real ""symptoms"" that I have is it 1. I’m extremely into history,  2. I’ll cry maybe once a month if I get too stressed. I have heard that Australia doesn't allow people to immigrate with any health issues, but I’m not exactly wanting to spend the rest of my life in Australia, only 5–10 years at the most. I’m planning to study History and become a high school teacher.



I’m extremely worried because I’ve sort of made out a guideline for my life, not extremely specific, just a general idea of what I need to do to get the things I want out of life, and moving to Aus for a few years is a part of that plan. I need some advice please, and if anyone could direct me to websites or people with the same stuff going on who successfully moved/ peoples immigration stories, that would be amazing!  
  
I’ve been getting very stressed about this for a while now, and I am willing to try to get my diagnoses re-done for the sake of immigration. (I’ll probably do that anyway, moving countries or not lol)/

I haven’t gotten my apprenticeship yet. Every “No” I’ve gotten has been very encouraging and not due to any fault of mine, so I know I’m close. 
When I inevitably go in for an interview I’m not sure whether I should disclose my diagnosis or not.

Typically with employers I don’t tell them right out the gates or at all because:
1. I don’t want to face discrimination, be underestimated, or outright rejected.

2. I can usually subtly self accommodate.

3. Most (not all) of my struggles can be disguised as anxiety.

Here’s why I think I might want to tell my future mentor:
1. The nature of a mentor / apprentice relationship is closer than that of the average employer / employee relationship.

2. Autism affects my processing and the way I learn - considering an apprenticeship is all about learning, this feels important for my mentor to be aware of.

3. I think this is going to be harder than any job I’ve ever had and I want to protect myself from burnout and meltdowns. I don’t want to have to mask for the foreseeable future. 

4. I’m sure at some point I will face a struggle caused or exacerbated by autism - communicating BEFORE would hopefully mean when it happens nobody is shocked. 

There are more reasons in both categories, but I don’t want to write an essay here, so we can leave it at that. We can continue discussion in the comments.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

2025-11-03 22:22:39;It sucks being undiagnosed, it now sucks even more being diagnosed;"Parents pushed me to get diagnosed and it took so long that i'm an adult now.

Before it was always a struggle to get my needs met, people didn't understand my need to do certain things, or behave in certain ways. My accommodations were pushed to the side by family, friends, school, and many professionals. This led me to lash out often, and I've had to learn to not show my anger no matter how hard it is not to. Even when everyone knew something was different about me, if i wasn't seemingly rational, I would be told off for something I couldn't control.

Now i'm diagnosed, I've just swapped those problems for new ones. If I lash out now, I cannot explain the reason because I'll be told I'm using my diagnosis as an excuse. If I try to accommodate myself, or ask for things, I again am told I'm using it as an excuse. The day I got my report back, my father said to me to try not to use this as an excuse for everything.

Before I was just treated as a troublemaker, but now I'm treated as a liar. And I'm not sure which is worse. Either way, I'm still looked down upon as subhuman, and lesser than those around me because I can't deal with things like they do.

2025-11-03 20:05:17;Finding out if I’m autistic?;I know this sounds weird, but I’ve been thinking to what extent my neurodivergency goes towards, if you catch my meaning. I have loads of special interests, I show signs of autism in several levels, I always relate to people on the autistic spectrum, and I feel like a complete outsider from the world. I’ve done countless amounts of research, and it all sounds right and applies to my life, I’ve just never actually been diagnosed. Autistic people or neurodivergent people, how did you know you were autistic or along similar lines? Or even better researchers on Reddit, what are the signs of autistic individuals? ;;;;
2025-11-03 19:20:55;Just got diagnosed at 34 !;"As the title confirms, today at 10.00 o'clock I've finally got the confimation I've longed for. ASD level 1.

After a year of doubt, burnout and hours of research.. I can finally say with confidence; that I am not broken, I am not failing at being human. I am autistic. 

It is still an unknown territory since I've just known it for the last 2 hours, but I feel so relieved, seen and finally somewhat hopeful that I will find the right tools to cope with life, after 34 years of trauma and struggles. 

Ofcourse I know that this diagnoses will not change anything, I am who I am. But it will help me along the way to figure things out for myself.

But after a year of lurking and reading all of your story's, in wich I found a lot of recognistion and peace (because it was just as if I wrote it myself, so I was not alone). 

I want to say thank you all! Thank you for giving me a place, that I will call home from now on 💛";;;;
2025-11-03 19:02:10;Stimulant meds helping with social interactions in adult ASD without ADHD anyone?;"Hi there,

Tldr; does anyone with ASD but without ADHD also have positive experiences with ADHD meds such as vyvanse in regards to social settings or is that uncommon?

So this year, I received an autism diagnosis after a thorough assessment, which also confirmed that I do not have ADHD. I still got prescribed vyvanse (as needed 3-5x/week) because it helps me immensely in social settings, especially with my partner. I’m usually overly-critical, get really hung up on inconsistent information when it doesn’t matter (and don’t realise the other person thinks I want to fight), get easily frustrated/angry when things change & sometimes hurt other people in these moments.

With vyvanse (lowest dose, sometimes even half of it), it’s a night and day difference. My partner says I seem so much friendlier & like I enjoy myself more in social settings. I don’t need it to get stuff done or to focus, so I don’t take it on days where I’m just working ironically. It’s like I get frustrated less easily and I feel like I have a few more seconds between when emotions come up & when I act upon them. Doesn’t change my autism but makes it easier to deal with in a sense? I tried Ritalin years ago but it made me even less social, felt like a robot, awful comedowns.

Does anyone experience what I experience or is it more likely that I might just have ADHD on top & the assessor missed it? Or is it moreso that it helps with masking & executive function in the short term but actually still drains my social batteries the same way, so it makes it easier for me to ignore my boundaries? Any input is appreciated.";;;;
2025-11-03 18:58:22;Is anyone else sick of being told you take things too “literally”?;I’m 37 been diagnosed autistic for over a decade. I am very open with my friends, family, and co-workers that I have autism. In fact, I share the fact with strangers. I am not ashamed. I am proud to be what I am. And since they all know that I have autism, I feel like they shouldn’t make these comments. Especially my family. They say I take things too literally, don’t let things go easy when I’m right, etc. I choose my words based on what I need to say. They use their words Willy nilly, and often sound unintelligent or offensive. And do I say anything? No! Because they are NT and that’s normal for them. But what about being considerate of my neurodivergence? Please share with me some of the things NT say to you that you think they should actually change instead of you, such as “you take everything so literal!” If we all said what we meant with less nuance, I wouldn’t struggle to understand NT so much!;;;;

So for the last 2 years my dad makes me shut up whenever I talk about my special interests. He thinks they are very meaningless, and berates them. This makes me feel pretty sad when he does it.

2025-11-03 16:31:49;Sometimes my depressive episodes are really hard to understand.;"I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder or dysthymia, but I’ve learned that depressive episodes I have are really a result of the shorter form cyclical burnout. Like I work too hard, socialize too much, don’t fill my cup, then I get depressed. Then I recover a bit and go into overdrive/ catch up mode, then the cycle repeats. I’ve gotten better at pacing myself but October was very busy. 

I’m making this post because I would like to share my challenges navigating this type of burnout/depression. When I’m in this state I have a lot of trouble recognizing when I’m overwhelmed and it leads me to lash out and be more meltdown prone. For example today my cat was being annoying because she had a need that I couldn’t meet yet. I ended up yelling at her and tossing her onto a chair but I used a bit too much force and she didn’t get to land gracefully.
Which isn’t fair to her at all and trust me guys I’m not gonna let it happen again.

What’s strange though is that before a snap like that I feel emotionally fine, maybe just a bit muted. And the stimulus itself (ie her meowing and tripping me up) isn’t annoying like it would normally be. It’s like I don’t get the warning signs until it’s too late. Only, this will happen with driving, grocery shopping, cooking. All stuff I have to be able to do.

I have another really busy week ahead of me and I’m going to try and care for myself so that I’m less likely to crash tf out, but does anyone that shares this experience have any advice for how to tell when I’m getting overwhelmed? And what to do when I can’t just leave a situation? I’m a server so it’s a high masking high intensity job and it’s the first bout I’ve had like this since returning to work after my severe burnout. I really don’t want to get back into the cycle of dissociating at work and then melting down after, it was very bad for me. 

Thanks to any and all advice, appreciate you folks.  ";;;;
2025-11-03 16:11:27;Right to choose - Autism assessment;"TLDR; How does NHS right to choose work? If I can be referred to a private clinic, how do I know which ones? Can I see a list of approx wait times for clinics?

I have an appointment this Thursday to speak to my GP about being referred for an autism assessment, as per strong recommendation by a mental health nurse I spoke to on the phone about wanting to look at getting unrelated diagnoses that were suggested in the past but never looked into. I was very deflated at her suggestion that I should get RE-assessed (I was assessed back in 2018, had a bad experience with the local clinic, made the mistake of not disclosing that I'm transgender, later realizing that the female socialisation I experienced growing up was 100% relevant & the assessor made me feel very uncomfortable/infantilized) but she recommended looking at NHS right to choose to pick somewhere that had a shorter waiting time since my local clinic is VERY understaffed (it took 2 years on a waiting list in 2018, I wouldn't like to imagine the wait time now).

This was months ago & I put off making an appointment but surprisingly, my GP actually rang me to make an appointment about being referred so now I'm panicking trying to find the information I need. I looked up what right to choose is but I'm struggling to find information on how to know WHERE I can choose to be referred to, apparently I you can ask to be referred to a private place as long as they also treat NHS patients. Also I want to go to somewhere with one of the shortest wait times since I've already been through this & I feel like I've wasted time I could've been diagnosed for the last 7 years already (I don't care about travelling a long distance for appointments)

Can anyone help with some info/resources to find where I can be referred to & estimated wait times for assessments please? Thank you in advance if anyone is able to help.o";;;;
2025-11-03 14:28:10;Evaluation report questions?;"I’ve just received the report from my initial evaluation appointment, and I’m a bit confused by some things. 

In the assessment methods section, number 5 states that I have repetitive stereotypical behaviors. But below that, in number 6, it states that I have no repetitive behaviors, despite the doctor noting out loud that I was stimming with my hands at the beginning of the appointment. This contradiction is really confusing me. 

In the DSM-5 diagnosis section, it says R/O ASD. I initially thought that this meant that it was being ruled out completely, but google says that this means that it requires further evaluation. Has anyone else had this on their report and received further evaluation, or will I just be stuck in undiagnosed limbo?";;;;
2025-11-03 13:56:20;Realistic job accommodations;"I was in the Army for 14 years. Joined at 18, all I ever knew. At age 32, I had to get a pacemaker, I was medically retired. I was distraught. I lost my career, my purpose, my goals, my everything.

Since then I have been spiraling. I had assumed it was a mix of PTSD that I had ignored for so many years and ADHD. I started seeking mental health services. I have now been evaluated twice and was diagnosed with autism at 34. Another mental spiral. I thought we all thought the same and had our quirks, but that was typical. I never talked to anyone about it because what was the point when I believed we all thought the same?

Well, now I know the truth and I need some guidance. I am now a building inspector in a male dominated field. I go in an hour early before everyone else so I can get my paperwork done. When everyone comes in I put two sets of noise cancelling headphones on so I can attempt to work, but it doesn’t do much.

By 9am I am out the door. When I go to these inspections I normally have the contractor two steps behind me. I ask them to let me go through the structure alone first so I can concentrate and then we can go back around together and I can point out the deficiencies. Not once has someone respected that request. Most of the time when I point something out it is an argument. I then begin questioning myself, am I getting this rule confused? Normally I am not mistaken but they instill so much self doubt I will spend the entire night making sure I wasn’t wrong. And it’s not bc I can’t accept being wrong, it’s bc I do not want to be giving out wrong info.

If my male counterparts back me up or call them out they do not receive any feed back. I was told last week by my boss (who is fielding the calls of complaints bc I am catching things they have gotten away with for years) that this is only happening bc I am a female and that he acknowledges that. He encouraged me to keep at it and to not let it bother me. I would never admit that it does, I don’t want to appear weak. But it is killing me inside to be so disrespected and my intelligence questioned multiple times a day. 

I am so overwhelmed at times I want to quit. I love the idea of my job, I learn something new everyday, I’m not tied to a desk, and buildings genuinely interest me! But I know the rage I’m containing inside me is not feasible long term. I live in the south and work for a small municipality- not exactly welcoming of folks that aren’t just like them. 

The things I would need to be accommodated is not really feasible, at least from my perspective. I want to get some guidance/opinions on how to handle my work situation. 

Things I need to continue with this position: 

quiet - work in a large shared office, phones ringing non stop, always 2-3 people in line, on really loud secretary that makes my ears bleed.

Extra time to finish reports - I have to have them perfect, I do not just throw them together like my counterparts. Nothing against them, it truly doesn’t matter, I just can’t turn in work that I am not proud of.

Alone time during inspections - Get these contractors to give me space and stop talking to me while I’m trying to do my job. I spend more time trying to evade them than doing my job and I know I am missing stuff. I explain that me missing stuff might be good for them now but it won’t be when someone gets injured or killed bc of their mistakes or sued, etc. 

Thank you, sorry for the long post, but wanted to be thorough. ";;;;
2025-11-03 13:34:21;Breakdown in front of my partner;"So I was officially diagnosed a few months back, even though I have suspected it for a few years now. I’m in my first long term relationship and am struggling with knowing what’s right and what’s too much. 

I’m a very introverted person, I need time to myself to recharge and bring myself to socialize. I’ve grown to love people, to want to be around them and have good experiences but I know that after a long day I need to rest. Unfortunately my partner doesn’t seem to get this.

We had been hanging out every day for about a week, and I didn’t really realize how overwhelmed I was getting. It was waking up and texting, seeing them, running around with them, and then I spent the night after a holiday party. The next morning my partner was so sweet and made us breakfast, and we settled in to watch a show. After the show I made my usual ‘I think it’s time I go home’ comment because I could feel that I was tired and needed time to myself. My partner unfortunately doesn’t tend to listen to this, trying to show me different things and get me to stay longer. 

I can’t really tell if they’re doing this on purpose or just not registering my request to leave? I don’t know. I try my best to communicate and usually I’m pretty good at it but this topic is hard for me. I don’t know how to talk about anything related to my autism and how it affects me. I’m still learning how to navigate it myself. 

Anyway, the routine started as always after I said I wanted to go. Pulling different videos up, trying to show me new songs, and such. I tried to stick it out, tried to listen and nod but I could feel myself going non-verbal. And then I was crying, and I don’t cry. I couldn’t stop it, just tears and feeling like my skin was on fire. My partner freaked out and asked if I was ok and I did my best to get it out that I was exhausted and needed to go. They tried to hug me and comfort me but it just made it worse. We got my things packed and I went home right after. 

They were understanding, but I don’t think they get why it happened. I know the end result is that we have to talk about it, and I’ll do my best to express myself. It’s just so frustrating, not knowing if this is normal. I feel like I’m not suppose to ‘get tired’ of spending time with them, that this is suppose to be my person and shouldn’t that mean I’m not overwhelmed by them? 

Any advice, or just similar story’s would help. I just feel so alone in this. ";;;;
2025-11-03 13:28:34;I could’ve lived just fine with autism;"I wanted university so badly I took a loan at 19 for private lessons but my brain was exhausted. One burnout destroyed it all.

I accepted long ago that I’ll never have a normal life or a partner. I accepted the daily bullying, no matter how small - even 1% of bad interactions can ruin a day.

But the job part broke me. I dropped out at 16 and never made it past minimum wage. Nowadays I wash dishes and get treated like I’m stupid just for being different.

The diagnosis was just the cherry on top, by then I couldn’t feel happiness anymore. My brother was diagnosed soon after me, which made it even heavier.";;;;

My question is to my fellow parents, or other individuals with similar diagnosis. What level of independence has been achieved by individuals with level 2 ASD? I want to be better able to prepare myself for what the future holds, and hopefully address some of my worries. 

We are not rich, I can only support him for as long as I am able to work. Short of winning the lottery, I do not have the capability of setting up a trust fund that will take care of my kid long after I am gone. 

I am 38 now, and my wife 36. So we still have 20plus years of being able to work left to us.

We also have a 2nd kid who is about to turn three, but he is not showing signs of autism. So he may be able to take care of himself just fine when he reaches adulthood.

2025-11-03 13:11:36;Diversity vs. Neurodiversity;"Your thoughts requested.

(Extra brief backstory - high functioning, had a great career, diagnosed in early 2024 and not 100% sure I believe the diagnosis)

Neurotypical people are at least as diverse (compared to each other) as neurodivergent people are (compared to each other and to neurotypical people).

(Do I correctly understand the definition of “diverse” in the context of autism? It just means “different,” correct?)

My assertion is based purely on my life experience - meeting and knowing people throughout my life who are very different from each other and from me. People fall into such descriptive categories as introvert, extrovert, quiet, talkative, honest, liar, quirky, nuts, crazy, nice, mean, intelligent, non-intelligent, stable, unstable, unfeeling, emotional, etc. etc. etc. I know that personalities can be sorted into groups or types and there has been much study of this.

It seems there are spectrums of personalities of neurotypical people that indicate at least as much diversity as is seen in neurodivergent people.

Why is this relevant? I’m pretty socially awkward and was just thinking about how the people I do interact with are so very different from me and from each other. And there is no reason for me to believe that I am witnessing neurodiversity as the word is used to describe autism, ADHD, etc.; these people would generally not be diagnosable as autistic or anything else.

Am I wrong? Maybe it’s just that the quirky and crazy people I have met over the years have yet to see a psychologist or psychiatrist.

I envision myself getting together socially with some neurodivergent people and attempting to communicate and interact. These would be high functioning adults like me. Would this situation and environment be more or less challenging? Would I feel more or less like I fit in, compared to interactions and communication I have had over the years with neurotypical people?

Maybe I’m just exhibiting a misconception that neurodiverse people get along with each other better than neurotypical people do.

Anyway, I hope I’m not too incoherent here. I’m just looking for some discussion and hoping that I hit on something.";;;;
2025-11-03 11:44:48;Has anyone read “Atomic Habits” by James Clear?;"If so, what did you make of it?

I have noticed that every person I have seen recommend this book has not been ND, nor ND friendly…

The most recent is my spouse (audhd diagnosed) who’s manager has kinda been on his ass for issues that are really about lack of accommodation (however he is not really willing to work with my spouse to figure out what accommodations he is willing to give). But he recently gave my spouse a negative review for the year regarding some of these issues (mostly regarding communication which is a struggle for us anyway), and then GAVE my spouse a copy of this Atomic Habits book.

I feel like people think they’re being helpful, and especially this manager probably believes he is being helpful. But I feel like a lot of the folks recommending it are actually putting the onus on you to fix the issue rather than making it a team effort? 

I am considering reading it myself, but I feel iffy about it. It was recommended to me by a psychiatrist who wasn’t really understanding of ND and pretty much told me I needed better self discipline to manage my adhd (that she was prescribing me meds for mind you lol). 

ANYWAY, for folks who maybe haven’t read it but heard of it, have yall noticed a similar trend with this book?

2025-11-03 08:18:54;People mistake my boyfriend's autism for him just being an entitled male jerk and it breaks my heart;"EDIT: Non autistic OP here!  
  
(Just flagging my boyfriend is quite early in his autism journey so please forgive me if I use any wrong language / terms - I'm still learning all of this!)

So for context, my boyfriend is white, tall, well-dressed, and very handsome in a super masculine way (big old jawline, thick eyebrows etc). Essentially, he's the kind of guy you might picture if someone said ""imagine an entitled, pain-in-the-ass straight white man"". (Even though he is actually the sweetest guy in the world!) He's also, at 32, just been diagnosed as level 1, and it's all super new to him. I'm in the arts and have lots of autistic friends as well as an anxiety disorder myself, so I'm more familiar with this space than he is.

It's not uncommon for my bf to get overwhelmed or distressed in public - it maybe happens once every 2 weeks and is usually caused by a sense of injustice, or  sensory triggers like something in his eye or getting too hot. When he gets distressed, he can be blunt and a bit short with people. No swearing or insults, but still, straight-shooting to the max. And the response he *always* gets, without fail, is people being visibly mad at him, and treating him poorly afterwards.

\[Best example I can give - one time a young woman cut in front of him in a line and when the bartender tried to serve her, my bf said ""No, sorry, I was next."" The bartender scoffed at him, then was super rude while he ordered and lied about being out of the drink he wanted. Another man in line who'd witnessed it said to the young woman ""you can go before me - some people are so terrible, aren't they?"" My bf was devastated because he didn't understand why he'd become the pariah in that situation when he really was next in line.\]

I sometimes think that because of the way he looks, people don't cut him any slack or give him the benefit of the doubt the way they might others. I completely understand that there are lots of situations where all autistic people are not treated with kindness and understanding! But I feel like more and more, when I'm with other autistic friends who dress a bit more alternatively and maybe present a bit more nerdy, queer, or just unconventional, I see wait staff and strangers being kind and patient with them in a way I've never seen anyone act with my bf.

I totally understand that full-on male energy can be really repellent to people and make them feel unsafe. But I'm genuinely shocked that no one ever seems to consider that maybe this is a neurodivergent person struggling to cope and *he* feels unsafe. Or even just like, basic customer service - be nice to his face and then complain about him later - people actively turn on him and are mean to him!

I just don't really know what to do. He tries to laugh it off but I know it gets him down, and it really breaks my heart because he is honestly the sweetest person outside of these moments!";;;;
2025-11-03 08:04:17;Feeling sad about getting my almost 3 year old diagnosed, because I’m realising I may also be autistic;"I (33F) have had my suspicions that my daughter may have autism since she was 10 months old (stimming, obvious developmental delays, not laughing until 18 months old and when she does it’s a mimicked laugh and lots more). I held off looking into diagnosis after seeing you can’t get diagnosed before 2, but since turning 2, her autistic behaviours have ramped up (clamps hands over ears when overstimulated, gets VERY upset when an exhaust fan or blow dryer is turned on near her).

Here’s where my feelings get complicated: I find myself at the ripe old age of 33 realising that I understand and empathise with her on an ethereal level as I believe I’m an undiagnosed autistic female too. Having this thought and deep-diving about later in life diagnosis and female autism was like an “ah-hah” moment for me. My whole life suddenly made sense - why I always felt out of place, why I always felt like I was wearing a mask, why acting was such an unexplainable interest of mine…it truly blew my mind and I almost felt silly for not questioning myself earlier.

Seeing my daughter struggle with sensory things suddenly makes me sad - like I have failed her in some way because “she got autism from me” (that’s how my brain feels). 

I just booked a GP consult for her and I’m in tears at the prospect of getting her diagnosed, with my mind racing - what if I’m just projecting? is it worth getting myself diagnosed too? Am I a bad mum for not figuring out my own stuff sooner? 

I just really feel like a terrible parent for the possibility that she has inherited neurodivergence from me.

Has anyone else faced these complicated feelings, gone through something similar or just have some good ol’ reddit stranger advice for me?

I’d greatly appreciate it";;;;

I send tiktoks and stuff and they just read it and ignore it (mind you it’s the weekend so nobody is working and they def have time to answer because they answer other people) I just feel so undervalued by my friends when this happens. Like it takes an iota of attention and care for me as a friend to watch or answer the chat. This comes after my friend asked me for gas money after he dropped me off after he randomly came to my house and picked me up. I feel like I’m being used and not really making connections I want to maintain. ";;;;

2025-11-03 05:53:39;Anyone elses family feel like random roommates?;"I live at home with my parents and sibling. Even though we share the same space, we barely interact. Everyone stays in their own room, and it’s not because of any major conflict. We just don’t talk. Sometimes we go days without a real conversation, even when we cross paths.

Growing up, we were pretty sheltered, and were pretty close until around age 12 (sibling would've been 14). But now it feels like we’re just coexisting. Even my parents don’t spend much time together.

I’ve been diagnosed with level 2 autism, and I sometimes wonder if this dynamic could be related. Maybe my family also has autisim but it went undiagnosed? The emotional distance, the tendency to keep to ourselves, the lack of spontaneous interaction could potentially be autistic traits.

I’m not necessarily looking for more connection, but I do find it odd and isolating at times. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so is your family also autistic? I'm wondering if it could be an autistic thing or just how some families operate?

TLDR: Live with family, but we all keep to ourselves. Does anyone relate/could it be an autistic family thing?";;;;

2025-11-03 05:04:20;Need advice about autistic burn out;"Hello everyone ! So, i'm (M) 29 and in a big, big burn-out since 5-6 months. Already seeing psychologist, psychiatrist and family doctor every once in a while, for a brieve recap i've been in a big theater school in France, with terrible plannings, organisation and group. I've done the equivalent of a Master (+ 2 more years as a student director), sometime with 90-110 hours a week of work, and 10 days of ""rest time"" a year. Needless to say i fell pretty well, with panic attacks, enormous stress, no more sleep, gain weigh etc ... Also i was in a colocation with a very toxic and dirty person, like blood, fecal matters, screams etc, but since 2 month i've finally managed to get this person legally out of my appartment (now i have to use 85% of my money to pay the whole rent but i prefer that).

And, even if i have gain ""some"" energy back, (because litterally when i stopped everything i coudn't move out of my bed, i'm speaking about if i did, i would have passed out without a doubt, i was like this for weeks, with loooots of crying etc ...) i don't have at all my energy back, sometime i feel like i have 40-50% of it and sometime 20%, and i'm starting to feel really bad about not healing fast enough, or not good enough, even when terapist say that it seems okay and i have a good medical following, i feel bad and sad, like i'll never be able to do anything outside without being exausted after for days. And i really don't feel like i **can** do this job without years of ""reset"", even if i absoluttly love theater, and think i'm pretty good at it

Is anyone can relate/have advice ?

2025-11-03 05:03:14;Overwhelmed in my new home;"Ok so...I'm diagnosed with ASD traits. I moved into a new 4 bed house share with some new people I don't know. They all seem nice
 It's not a party house but I didn't realise how creaky the floorboards are. It's quiet apart from the creaking
I've been waking up at 3am, cuz the floorboards creaky when my upstairs housemate walks across them to use the bathroom. The door to this is pretty loud too..I chose the room that wasn't next to the bathroom, but this means it's below the top room and I didn't anticipate this scratching sound above...


I feel like my hearing is WAY too acute
Like my brain tries to listen harden to things
The house is a bit echoey
And the cieling of my bedroom has loose floorboards, so there's the weird grinding noise when my housemate is in their room. 

Essentially it was like this In my last house share too, I'm way too finely tuned...
I wonder if these are autism symptoms or being hard wired to trauma and wanting to protect my safety.

 I used to listen to thunderstorm generators and podcasts religiously every night to counteract the sounds of housemates.  I guess I'll start that up again in a week or so when the WiFi is installed. But then it doesn't block out everything and I don't want to put it on so loud it disturbs others
 But the sound of the cieling is like a rat scratching at my ears, I don't know if thats an exaggeration but she's not jumping around, it's clearly just a creaky floorboard.

has anyone else had any similar issues with being over sensitive to sound in their home?

2025-11-03 02:30:50;A little rant, seeking support/constructive criticism;"I have all these thoughts and I was hoping for some support. Wondering what you all think

I was sent in for evaluation from a therapist in high school who was confident that I was on the spectrum. When the evaluation came back negative, she said “well, sometimes these tests can be wrong” and said that she believed they were mistaken. At the time all I wanted was to be normal so I pushed all thought about it away. But as I continued to struggle through college and beyond I still wonder a lot. Now I’m going to try to get evaluated again but it is probably going to take a long time. In high school I remember trying so hard to get things right for the exam. 

I was diagnosed with severe OCD a couple years ago - it got very severe in my last year of college but I didn’t know what it was until a year after. I read that OCD is a common co-occurrence? it is now under control enough through therapy that I have started to really wonder about the autism again.

I know in elementary school I was quiet and shy and a bit awkward, but I did have friends. I did offend some people without meaning to, and was a bit rude sometimes. But in middle school I really became a loner. There was some family problems as well. I tried hard to break out of it in high school and even started multiple clubs but I just couldn’t.

Most people don’t seem to like me. I try very hard to be nice;  I have my husband but we have a lot of difficulties in our relationship. Though overall he is supportive and nice - I worry about me not being enough in the relationship or acting poorly. 

In high school and college, I tried so hard to learn social skills. I watched every single JK Rowling interview on YouTube and tried to be like her. I read Harry Potter books out loud for a week or so because I thought it would help me learn to speak better with other people. In college I took French because I thought it would help me talk better with others. I studied abroad because I hoped the exposure would help me as well. Everywhere I turned it seemed I was met with failure. I get the feeling that people always think I am a bit weird. I have even been described as “creepy”, once in middle school, and once in a job after college. It is hard on me because I feel I try so hard. Sometimes I just feel like I can’t say anything no matter how much I want to.  

I’m not researching autism right now because I’m scared it will sway any evaluation results - I don’t want to “act more autistic” because I want a diagnosis. I honestly just want to understand myself better and be able to stop wondering. 

Anyways, that is all. I really really don’t want to come off wrong. I am open to any criticism and advice. Thank you

I was at someone else’s house from that friend group ONCE. 


We had a group chat that we sent like 50+ messeges a day. It’s quiet. Last time i asked about homework a week ago. IM NOT STUPID I CAN HEAR NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE GROUP CHAT THEY’RE ON. 


Im pissed. I never did anything. I know I don’t talk a lot, I explained it so so much over the years, im autistic, i still want to be included. Absolutely NOTHING changed, I even started talking to them more, there was zero situations i can even doubt were somehow a fight, i was masking for 16 years and only got diagnosed at 16, im not stupid with social stuff.

2025-11-03 02:30:13;The gamble of unmasking when you’ve been late diagnosed;"Something that’s been weighing on me lately is how unmasking after a late autism diagnosis feels like walking into social situations blindfolded. You spend years thinking you’re just a little awkward or anxious, then suddenly you realize all those years you were masking without knowing it. You start to understand yourself in a completely new way, but the moment you try to act more like yourself, everything feels unpredictable.

It feels like a gamble every single time. When you show more of your real self, you have no idea what others are seeing. Some people might have already sensed that you were autistic and just never said anything, so your authentic traits don’t surprise them at all. But others might have always thought of you as “normal,” and now the more natural you becomes confusing or off-putting to them. It creates this constant anxiety of not knowing how you’re perceived.

What makes it even harder is realizing that, before the diagnosis, you didn’t know you were pretending. You truly believed you were like everyone else, trying your best to socialize and connect the way others did. Then you look back and see all the little things that never worked, and it hurts in a way that’s hard to explain. You see the friendships that faded, the people who slowly distanced themselves, and you understand only now that they might have been reacting to traits you didn’t even know were autistic.

I actually lost a friendship years ago because I didn’t understand how much I was overwhelming someone by talking about my interests. At the time I thought I was just sharing something that made me happy, but now I can see how it probably came across as too much. I didn’t know how to pace myself or how to read when someone was politely nodding instead of genuinely engaging. That memory stays with me because I wasn’t trying to be annoying or intense. I was just being me, and it cost me someone I cared about.

That’s the part that makes unmasking so complicated. You finally have the language to describe your experiences, but the fear of being “too much” never really goes away. You start second guessing if people see you as a capable person who suddenly became strange, or if they always knew and you were the last one to figure it out. Both possibilities feel painful in different ways.

Unmasking is supposed to be freeing, but sometimes it feels like stepping into a spotlight you didn’t ask for. You’re proud of who you are, but you still carry the worry that being fully yourself might make others pull away.

Does anyone else struggle with this uncertainty? That fear that being your true self might make people see you differently, even if you’re finally starting to understand who that self really is?";;;;
2025-11-03 00:00:32;Would anyone diagnosed later in life like to share their stories about it?;"I have a diagnosis appointment booked, and I feel like I'm reaching a critical mass about my status. I'm feeling very panicky and confused about myself. I'm really just looking for some stories about what this process is like, and how the outcome affected you.

Some days I feel like a positive ASD diagnosis is imminent. Other days I feel like a complete fraud. I'm in my early forties, and this is such a head game.";;;;
2025-11-02 18:55:32;Male Attention;"Growing up I never got any male attention. I was awkward, 'strange', and didn't fit in culturally because I didn't have the same interests as everyone else. I was early diagnosed ASD, and everyone knew it. I got bullied throughout school, and the only attention I got from boys is when they were bullying me. As a teenager, this really did impact my self esteem, even though in retrospect I'm so happy I concentrated on my friends and never dated. This doesn't mean it didn't have lasting negative consequences.

In college I got into a relationship STRAIGHT AWAY, with a flatmate. This was shocking to pretty much everyone. I was in this relationship for 5 years, the formative years of my 20s. He was the sweetest person ever, but I couldnt cope with long distance after college and didn't feel like my heart was in it anymore, so we broke up.

I was celibate for almost a year after, living in the countryside with my parents. I felt so frustrated and riled up. Then I joined the dating apps, and unlocked a new kind of dopamine. 

Recently, that, mixed with a new sense of independence as I've moved to a city for a postgrad, has been a recipe for disaster in some ways. 

I crave male attention. A story like. A private message after I post something. All my matches on dating apps. If I go on dates with someone or get intimate with them, I look forward to any communication from them afterwards, and feel crushed when they don't. 

I feel like this is because I've started my life 10 years later than everyone else. My sister was doing all this chaotic stuff when she was 16-22, and seems to have gotten it out of her system. I'm at my peak physically right now, and seem to be making up for lost time. 

I feel pathetic, but the attention makes me feel so nice...idk what to do. Can't have it all obviously. It just makes me feel like I'll forever be alone because a) people still don't like my personality b) that I'll never be able to shake off this craving.

I feel like as autistic women, we are either fetishised, abandoned, or bullied by men. I know good people are out there but this is also a sad fact ";;;;

2025-11-02 10:42:55;I think I may be autistic??;"Hi hi!
I believe im autistic and i just learned from my mother that she wanted to get me tested when i was a child and they wouldn’t do it?

Im going to list why I do think I have it:

-I have sensory issues a lot and some things make me genuinely upset when i feel them and makes me feel either rage or like i want to cry for example I hate the feel of sherpa or I hate the zippers of bags, it makes my ‘teeth itch’ as I usually say.

-When i was doing job interviews i genuinely had such trouble keeping eye contact with them and it unnerved me a little to do so if that makes sense??

-I stim A LOT.. and i have these vocal stims I do that i repeat non stop and its like my brain turns off when i do them and it seems like its starting to frustrate others, ive been bouncing my legs and making a drumming motion with my hands or flapping my hands ever since i was a child.

- I have to have a schedule or else i feel frustrated and start crying or getting mad, for example once when i was 17-18 i tried to go over to my exes house and he cancelled last minute and i cried like the world was ending tomorrow just cause my plan was ruined

-I genuinely cannot like something normally, for example I really really like storms and a band and all of a sudden EVERYTHING is about them and i try to quote them all the time and i get really into topics when its about the things I like and I over analyze as much as possible.

-I dont know how to react when things are done for me, every Christmas when I was a child i used to side eye awkwardly and say ‘thanks’ or force a smile for pictures unless it had to do something with a obsession i had?? I dont know if thats something normal but when i see people opening gifts online they get excited or feel some sort of emotion and i just felt weird and it made me feel off with so many people looking at me

- I GENUINELY cannot read tones or read peoples facial expressions unless its my girlfriend speaking to me, and it makes me anxious over people getting mad at me or something and i cannot for the life of me fully remember someones face, its close but distorted to the point where its not right too

Are these signs of autism?? If so what are the steps to getting programs to help me regulate myself better? My mom wants me to get diagnosed and when people talk about being autistic and their situations i somewhat relate to it?? I genuinely dont know what the first step for even figuring out if I am is and its frustrating to think about.";;;;
2025-11-02 09:53:43;Best dating apps in Australia for neurodivergent people - if any good ones exist?;"Hi all,

I tried dating apps when I was younger and had no inkling that I was neurodivergent and gave up on them about a decage ago. Now I have been diagnosed, I've been able to process that and I'm feeling more confident about myself, I'm thinking of having another go at dating, but without the intensity that I used to apply.

I know that the current dating app scene is munted - three apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge) are owned by [Match.com](http://Match.com) and seem to give a horrible experience due to high costs and too many bots. I used to use [RSVP.com](http://RSVP.com) and I'm surprised it's still active, but I see that it was merged with the Oasis dating app and then sold to the developers of that app. I am also having a go with speed dating but I'm not sure that suits me best.

2025-11-02 07:45:00;what do you guys think of this routine I do to focus?;"I’m suspecting inattentive adhd in myself, for context, both of my psychiatrists considered it independently, my mom is diagnosed with moderate-severe combined adhd, and I have symptoms since I was a child. I’m trying to get diagnosed, and I always ruled out issues like hearing, I took a hearing test and I have above average hearing. 

Anyways I got pretty obsessed with adhd recently in the past few months and I came up with an idea to help me focus. First you need to know what meditation is. 

Meditation is when you sit still, and try to focus on your breath, eventually you’ll get distracted, but the whole point is to become aware and bring your focus back to your breath. It’s like training a muscle, but in your brain, your attention. 


At first I tried it by itself, and it was very hard, mentally painful, and I didn’t make much progress. So I decided to add some stuff right before it so I can focus better, I worked out (ran 2.5 miles in 30 minutes), I drank coffee, and I got 12 hours of sleep on that day. 

I had way better focus, and I got very focused after that meditation session, and even had better attention a few weeks into doing it. I literally got tingly sensations on my hands and for way better focus. ";;;;
2025-11-02 07:20:11;I can't unmask in front of just everyone unfortunately.;"Throughout this whole unmasking process, I'm learning a lot of things, one of them being that I can't share my honest self with everyone. I can never fully unmask with everyone because not everyone deserves to see it, and I think that's the saddest part. Especially when that includes some friends, some coworkers and some family members. 

Not everyone gets to see my unmasked self for a variety of reasons. They don't understand and instead of trying to make sense of what they see they berate and pass judgement. 

Now, I was diagnosed in kindergarten, so you'd probably think I was stimming and being my true self, right? No, I wasn't! I was told to stop rocking back and forth because it gave off the idea that I was ""developmentally delayed"". I had the t-rex arms out and had another family members pull my arms down (not aggressively). Despite me being autistic, I was made to act neurotypical because everyone else felt uncomfortable with the idea of me having a * gasp * disability. 

I'm uncovering so much and I'm learning plenty about myself right now, but the people around me don't understand what it's like to live in my body. The constant fatigue, the 'sensory exhaustion', everything that comes with being me. They think I'm being lazy and not trying hard enough. 

Anyway that's beside the point...

I just want to live in a world where I can be myself and not feel judged by others, that's all.

2025-11-02 04:47:18;Just finally learnt why I had trouble with advance English/math classes.;"I don't know why it took me so long, almost fifteen years, to realise that I always had trouble understanding fluid reasoning/abstract thinking, and that I always preferred looking at the minute details first to try to build the big picture. I learnt that bottom-up thinking was very common among our community than top-down thinking. Furthermore, I always wrote idioms/proverbs in my diary as a way to memorise them because I always had difficulty understanding/interpreting them unless they were more obvious.

I always had trouble reading in between the lines, but I must have masked it pretty well enough to have it go unnoticed in school. I was put back three grades in math when I got to middle school, but I supposedly excelled in English until I could not understand any of the literary classics we had to read, like Of Mice and Men or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. Somehow I always found myself focusing on the scenes of where they were or what they were doing, but I couldn't always figure out why or how.

Going to Algebra II was like a real nightmare when I got to radicals, logarithms, and rational equations to a point where I even got a zero, but surprisingly, when we got to sequences and series, it felt like an amazing reprieve because I got to work with patterns again.

So in spite of this academicstruggle/camouflage, why did it go unnoticed? People said that while I did struggle with socialisation, I always socialised with folks who had hyperfocus/special interest and who were good conversation leaders, like those with diagnosed ADHD. So, if my special interest was pipe organs, I could go into a lot of detail about them with someone who also liked pipe organs, and it would look like I was socially engaged.

Why did nobody notice my tendencies to elope whenever I was at church when I was just a tyke? I'd always strategically sneak away to look for my favourite instruments, like the pipe organ in the balcony or band/orchestra instruments. Whenever I went to the bank with my mum, I always went in search for the pneumatic tube system because I loved how the tube went underground/above ground and was sucked inside. I always imagined myself being transported that way. Or, whenever I went to my mum's friends' homes, I'd always look in their kitchen to see if they had any interesting appliances because I was fascinated by ice cream machines and still am to this day. Basically, the larger or more intricate the appliance was, the more exciting it was to engage with. In fact, I used to take things apart to see what was inside of them.

When I finally graduated out of high school, I had this naive goal of wanting to go into neuroscience to better understand colour-sound synaesthesia, which I actually happen to have, but I ended dropping out of college when the classes became too difficult and the need to think and plan ahead became too much for me to bear. Then years went by with me trying to look for a way that I could volunteer/work, until I realised that I was LGBTQIA+, so I joined communities to better get myself involved. I tried going back to school but found that I had to retake the same math classes yet again, so I think I gave up on that.
I have not been to school ever since and had to get on Disability--luckily I qualify based on another disability, but my experience has always been that because of said disability, it was likely that there was some diagnostic overshadowing or unconscious masking going on.
I would absolutely love to go back to work, and people had told me that I am a very capable person, but I do need supports to make that happen. I would ideally love to work in a place where I could get extensive job carving and engage with my special interest and get sensory satisfaction of how different machines sound and things like that. For instance, working in a food-service/concession stand would allow me to constantly work hands-on with popcorn machines and things like that, or learn how to manage a coffee cart. I used to have a job a few years ago tuning pianos which provided me with a great amount of motivation/novelty, so I am grateful that I had learnt that skill because I am very musically interested in classical/jazz.

Have y'all had similar experiences and were able to somehow break this vicious cycle of sitting at home and doing nothing to finally getting life-long support? The problem with getting on any I/DD waiver is that when you do not have an intellectual disability, you have to prove that your adaptive behaviour is equal to someone who has an intellectual disability. And, that kind of information would have to come from a collateral source, like someone who has known you for a long time, such as a parent or sibling. There would have been a diagnosis of a mental or physical condition, or a combination of both, that must have originated in and directly affected the brain, and must have continued and expected to continue, indefinitely, before the age of twenty-two for a developmental disability. I finally have one, but it sadly came too late.";;;;
2025-11-02 04:32:16;35 yo Female Burnout! Boss has noticed and is genuinely willing to help but I don’t know what I need.;"As per the title. You guys seem decent and not so gatekeeper ish. I have been a grocery store clerk at a major 🇨🇦 chain for seven years now. I very much love my job and the customers and coworkers and superiors.

Over the last two years I’ve been steadily declining in being on time for my shifts, staying focussed, being up and upbeat like usual, and blowing off shifts on the regular due to overwhelm (and avoiding a shit disturber coworker in another department of whom has finally resigned. She’s had sooo many complaints against her for her horrid behaviour).

A common denominator is the sudden death of my sister on 10/01/22, and my father on 10/22/24. Also being majorly devastated, and undermined, when a Special Olympics World Games that I was a part of and training for, was outright cancelled and hardly anyone cared. In September 2023 I was also formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a massive mental breakdown and became a danger to myself.

Anyhow, beside the point. Let me be abundantly clear: I love my job and the ppl I work with, and 95% of customers are great. My boss approached me for a second time in as six months, pointing out what he’s observed, and he seems genuinely willing to help me. The thing is, I don’t know what I need or what he can do to help. He’s one of those rare bosses who are actually really decent. I am in this vicious circle of trying to be on time, and without fail I lose track of time and being able to wake up at a decent time. I have been feeling withdrawn at work and I try to make myself snap out of it, but that doesn’t work either. 

It’s not just at work I’m having troubles at. I’ve debated quitting several of my special Olympics sports due to zero patience for objective favouritism, no longer fawned over by what was my favourite coach, and bullying and seeing little be done about it. Embarrassingly, I have also been struggling with personal hygiene… I’m lucky if I bathe once a week. In between I shamefully just get generous with the deodorant. ";;;;
2025-11-02 04:26:37;Had my assessment today;"While I think I’m on the spectrum, I wont be devastated if they say that I am not. 

I am more worried about getting a random diagnosis like “psychopath” or something. I shouldn’t…I care about people and feel bad when I do something wrong. I have no desire to hurt others for my own gain, or anything — I’m just scared that I’m gonna get a result and it’s going to be something absolutely life-altering.

I know in my heart that I was “myself” and I answered honestly - even if the answer would stereotypically make me “seem” “less autistic” because I really just want to be honest. 

Im just anxious about how I was perceived, I guess — not the result. ";;;;
2025-11-02 03:01:27;Am I neurodivergent?;Yesterday a friend asked me if I’m neurodivergent and I’m honestly not sure 😂. When I was a kid, I was never diagnosed but I had a lot of traits that I think could be associated with neurodivergence, such as being extremely homesick at school and crying, getting lost around my school, getting bullied and having trouble making friends, needing to wear socks inside out, being extremely advanced in reading, carrying my blanket everywhere, etc. I’m an adult now and I grew out of a lot of these things, like wearing socks incorrectly or having trouble with friends. I’m fairly social as an adult and I have good friends, I go on dates, and I do pretty well in college. I do have anxiety and some traits of OCD but I’m not diagnosed, and I do still feel different than other people sometimes. I’m just not sure how to tell if I’m neurodivergent or not so I need some perspective;;;;
2025-11-02 02:25:49;Exercise helps me focus and have better mental health so much, does anyone else feel this way?;"For context I’m suspecting inattentive ADHD, and I have some evidence for it. My mom is diagnosed with moderate-severe combined adhd, I have symptoms my whole life, and both of my psychiatrists suspected it independently. 

Exercise is very good for me, and my mom says it works better for her than adderall";;;;
2025-11-02 01:45:38;We're Looking for Participants! Help Us Figure Out How Autistic Traits Shape What People Choose to Read... (No Formal ASD Diagnosis Required);"Hi all — posting with mod approval. I’m part of a University of Exeter project exploring how **autistic traits** shape what people choose to read.

The aim is to find out what makes different types of reading material more or less salient. All you need to do is take a short experiment and answer a few questions (it takes 20-30 minutes, typically).

**If you're interested, the following link will take you to the experiment:** [https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/ECAAB9A9-AF51-4487-8B68-1F823F57D85F](https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/ECAAB9A9-AF51-4487-8B68-1F823F57D85F)

You do not need a formal ASD diagnosis to participate; it is open to everyone providing you are 18+ and fluent in English.

If you have any questions at all, please message me directly – I'll be happy to answer them.";;;;
2025-11-02 01:05:30;Switching careers and fear of talking to HR;"Looking for some advices. I’m looking for new job for a long time. I send many applications, I have a degree in Industrial Engineering.  Sometimes I can spend hours sending applications. The problem comes later. 

A lot of HR’s are calling without notice so it makes me frustrating as I hate when people call me without notice, in most cases I just don’t pick a phone (my partner tells me that it’s really childish) 

Sometimes when I decide to talk it looks like people find me “strange” and decide to continue with other candidates. 

I feel like I’m loosing hope to find a high skilled job which I’m able to do as I have knowledge and understanding, but I feel that people don’t want to know me better. 

I’m diagnosed with ADHD, as of self evaluation most probably I have Asperger ";;;;
2025-11-02 01:02:57;Job interviews are the bane of my existence. So I wrote this guide for us.;"I’m autistic (late-diagnosed) and interviews have been a nightmare for me. I struggle with understanding job specs, getting answers out under pressure, and handling curveballs on the spot. Advice from (well meaning) job coaches helped a bit, but didn’t fit how I think.

A month ago or so, I put together a guide based on peer-reviewed research. It's kind (I hope), follows a clear process, and made for people like us, especially if you are feeling overwhelmed by any stage in the process. You can read the entire guide for free below. No sign-ups, it’s all there in the page to read.

[https://autisminterviewguide.com](https://autisminterviewguide.com)

Just  wanted to put it out there and hopefully it will help a few people.

P.S. If you find the guide helpful, I am writing more guides like this (currently working on one about shame). You can subscribe on the page if you'd like them sent to you when they're ready, it's free and just occasional updates.

2025-11-02 00:23:15;How can I tell my parents?;I’ve never posted about anything like this before- my parents are the kind who do not want to get here kids diagnosed so they don’t have a label. I have a much younger brother who I love and care for. Lately I have noticed some behavior showing signs of neurodivergence. I am autistic and grew up wondering why I was so weird and why no one liked me. It took me 15 years to realize I was autistic and I still can’t tell my parents ( they would not like that very much) I want my brother to grow up with an understanding of himself. How do I go about this with my parents? I think getting kids diagnosed early is extremely important and in the past talks like this have not gone well. Anyone have any tips?;;;;
2025-11-01 23:16:11;Is this a bad idea for trying to get an IEP/504?;"(By the way, I’m getting diagnosed really soon. Which might be why they won’t help me but, I promise I’ve done so much research. I’ve talked to multiple different therapists and gone over the DSM-5. I hit every point for ADHD and have since I was in elementary. And same with ASD.)

I’m 16F and I just recently found out I have ADHD and Autism these past two months. I’m in junior year and I had a meeting with my counselor and school psychologist about an IEP or 504 plan because of it. I am doing pretty well in school and that’s the reason they won’t give it to me. They said “you’re not struggling in any way or failing so we can’t help you.” It makes me so upset because my brain is so tired and I have a million things racing at once that in order to answer a single question I have to work 100x harder than everyone else. It’s so annoying because I also have POTS and they will gladly give me a 504 for that but not neurodivergence because I’m “not struggling”. 

So, I’ve decided to stop trying. I don’t mean by not doing assignments at all but, doing them in the way I would if there were no deadlines and grades. Because I want the help and accommodations that I can get. I spent my whole life struggling in school because nobody notice that I was neurodivergent. I want to feel seen and heard and not just brushed under the rug anymore.

Is this a bad idea? I’m just tired of trying a million times harder than everyone just to do one assignment. My brain sucks so bad I can’t even remember the last time I truly learned something in school. It’s so embarrassing and I just want help.";;;;
2025-11-01 22:31:35;How my son helped me discover autism;"As a kid I had a dream: that I could invent a time machine that allows me to go back and restart my life, but retain all my wisdom, so I could do it better the second time around. I could do better in school, and then my parents would be proud of me. If I could turn back time, I could make all the smart moves, all the smart choices, and be the best version of myself.

I mean, just imagine how much better your life could be if you had all the knowledge beforehand so you would never make another bad decision ever. Imagine how adult-Vlad’s mind could help guide little-Vlad, the kid, to become a genius that everyone admired.

You see - although being reasonably smart, for some reason school was extremely boring for me, and I wasn’t interested in studying anything. I constantly blamed myself for being lazy, for not being smart enough, for not doing well in school. My parents were extremely strict about grades, and when I fell short, I could feel their disappointment deeply. That guilt was very heavy on this little kid. In my mind, it translated into “I’m not worthy of love”. By my own parents, by me, or anyone in the world.

But then I had an idea. Short of inventing an actual time machine, when I was in second grade, I realized that I could get bad enough grades that the school would make me repeat the year. That was perfect! Just what I needed! If I studied the first time around, then when I would repeat the year, I would be the smartest kid in class, because I would already know everything! And then my parents would be proud of me, and would love me!

So I studied hard, and when there was an exam to take, I would simply not write anything. Then I would get a bad grade, and voila! Year repetition! It’s kinda like a time machine, right?

Or so I thought…

My parents got wind of this plan pretty quickly when they confronted me for not studying for an exam, and I had to tell them what was really going on. They were furious! I won’t go into the horrors that happened next, but needless to say, I was “motivated” to not repeat the year.

School was hard, and there were times when I contemplated suicide. Imagine the mind of a 4th grader toying with those kinds of ideas. It was brutal.

Thankfully, nothing bad like that happened. Only one thought kept me going: at your lowest, there’s no way to go but up. With time, school got ever so slightly easier year after year.

Eventually, I wasn’t just getting by - I actually became quite brilliant. I achieved a few national Olympiad prizes, and to top it all off, in 12th grade I reached Romania’s National Olympic Team in Physics. There were many other grand things that I have accomplished after, but that’s a story for another day. In short, I had overcome my challenges with school.

And yet, when it was all over, I still felt a huge sense of relief.

Fast forward to today, I have a career that I am proud of, and a family that I love more than anything, friends that I wouldn’t have dreamed of, and I feel that I have found my place in the universe.

And then, recently as I was researching why my kid is holding food in his mouth for so long (a.k.a. “food pocketing”), I was reading into symptoms of ARFID - a very serious eating disorder linked with Autism where you just won’t eat. And I noticed that (thankfully) my kid doesn’t have those symptoms, but that half of those matched my very own experience when I was little. You see, as a kid I was eating so little and so selectively that I was barely putting on weight, and my parents had to supplement me with vitamins and all kinds of other stuff to give me extra appetite. I was in danger of not growing naturally because of it. As I was reading about all that, I thought… huh… that’s strange, but then closed the website and moved on.

Then, separately, the person who runs the daycare that my kid goes to mentioned that Noah has some sensorial sensitivities, he is unusually smart, and has an unusual memory. Nothing to worry about, but she thought that a specialist might be able to qualify those symptoms better as he might be “special needs” as a result of his high intelligence.

I ignored that remark because I was looking at my kid and he seemed like a perfectly normal 3-year-old to me. He seemed like any other small kid I knew.

Then one day, my wife said that we should actually look into autism and assess Noah just in case. I said “Noah seems exactly like me in every possible way. Since I am not autistic, it’s unlikely that Noah would be.” Well it turns out that I was right about only half of that statement. He is like me.

When I had some time, I started researching the topic, and looked into how autism might be assessed. It looked complicated for a three-year-old. But I figured that there should be an easy way to rule out that at least I am not autistic. There has to be an online test or something. ChatGPT recommended the top five.

I took the first. I thought: that’s strange… this test has the impression that I might be autistic. Also… why do they ask about all these perfectly normal things that surely everyone experiences.

I took another one. Weird… why is this score so high?

It dawned on me after the fifth test. The Aspie quiz said that it’s 79% likely that I’m autistic.

Wait… so all those things they asked about are not common? It started clicking… I spent the next week reading and learning everything I could about autism. I found patterns after patterns across my entire life. The early eating challenges, the unusual sensorial sensitivities, my analytical mindset, my general withdrawal as a kid, my social awkwardness as a teen… my difficulties at school!

It was like a Kaiser Soze moment. I had watched an entire movie only to be revealed a crazy plot twist at the end, and now I was replaying the whole thing in my mind all over again with this newfound perspective.

I found pattern after pattern, experience after experience that was explaining everything. Suddenly all my early struggles made sense!

At the same time, I realized that being autistic is what enabled me in my career. It’s what made me meet my wife. It’s what brought just about all my accomplishments - personally and professionally - and also my friendships. It is deeply ingrained in who I am. And thankfully, by this time I’ve learned to work with most of my autistic traits, which now lets me enjoy mostly the upsides.

Despite all my early challenges, I wouldn’t trade it away for anything.

Looking back, I don’t blame my parents. They were doing what they thought would help me succeed. And they did and do love me very much. None of us knew back then what autism was or how differently I experienced the world - let alone in post-communist Romania. (Studying Psychology and Mental Health had been banned during communist times.)

It’s a little too early for an official diagnosis, but chances are that my kid too, Noah, has level 1 autism. He lines up toys in a row, is sensitive to touch and to certain sounds, he adores routine, he is sensitive to change, he likes to sit and think about things, and apparently he is “super intelligent” - or so we’re told.

Now… remember about my dream to invent a time machine? Well, when I held Noah in my arms for the first time, I realized that having a kid is about as close as you can get to that dream: you can do it all over again, but live life through their eyes. And if you’re a parent, you’ll know that it feels every bit as intense as your own.

But this time, I know better. This time, I know how to take care of him so that he feels at home in a world of neurodiversity. I know to love him exactly the way he is, and I know to encourage him to follow his passions. To create an environment that values unconventional thinking and learning through curiosity. I know not to be hard on him, and to be by his side when he is struggling. I can create for him the childhood I wish I had. And that, to me, can be a miracle as grand as a time machine itself.";;;;

💙 About Us

I’m a NT parent with a newly diagnosed Autism Level 1 son.
He’s only 5 years old, and I love him so incredibly much.

To be honest, his diagnosis terrifies me — not because of who he is, but because I’m scared of how much harder life might be for him.
I want him to: 

* Have good self-esteem

* Make the friends he wants and not be lonely

* Avoid being bullied

* Grow into an independent adult with a good job and stable life


Basically, I just want to set him up for happiness and success.


---

🧠 His Current Challenges

At school:

* He really struggles to focus or follow instructions.

* I suspect AuDHD (Autism + ADHD).

* No distressing meltdowns ( as in crying, screaming) but he appears zoned out and will just lay on the floor and go limp if you try to pull him up.  


At home:

* Things are better — but if he’s not interested, teaching him is tough. But generally he is very regulated at home and able to do so much more. 


Socially:

* He wants to play with other kids.

* But he has trouble with social cues like personal space and how to join playgroups appropriately.

* Looking back, I can now see these things as part of his autism.


Despite it all, he’s such a happy, loving boy with us — he hasn’t started masking yet (thankfully), and he just enjoys being himself.

All I want is for him to stay happy.

💬 My Questions

1️⃣ Is disclosing an autism diagnosis helpful?

This one is tearing me apart.

Knowing you’re different from neurotypicals can sometimes hurt self-esteem or cause self-limiting beliefs.
But not knowing can lead to confusion, self-blame, and constant criticism from others.

At the same time, disclosure can bring ostracization, infantilization, and bullying.
Even though awareness and acceptance are growing, stigma is still very real.

So what’s the right balance here?


---

2️⃣ What actually helped you growing up?

If you’re autistic yourself — I’d really love your perspective:

* Did it help when your parents explained autism to you?
(I’m NT, and honestly not sure how to explain it yet — but I don’t want him to think something’s “wrong” with him.)

* Did it help when your extended family knew? (Aka grandparents/uncles/aunts you see on a regular basis)
Some of ours have very outdated views and have criticized him for things like not greeting people or avoiding eye contact.
Now that he’s older, it’s more noticeable, and I’m scared they’ll box him into their idea of “autistic” and underestimate him.
But I also want them to understand him better.

* And what about public disclosure while he’s still young?
I want to protect his privacy and let him choose when he’s older…
But is there a benefit to sharing earlier?

❤️ Final Thoughts

Thank you so much if you made it this far.
I’m just trying to learn, understand, and support him in the best way I can.

At the end of the day, all I want is for him to be happy, confident, and understood.";;;;
2025-11-01 19:12:22;Soon to be diagnosed, but I'm afraid my parents will begin to use this possible diagnosis against me.;"For context, I'm 18, still living with my parents. Around two months ago, I finally started researching autism, pushed by friends who were diagnosed who told me they thought I could be autistic. The stories, the criteria, the experiences, they all fit me pretty perfectly, and the AuDHD experience resonated even more.

Just yesterday, I came forward to my parents and asked if they could help me get an autism and ADHD assessment, to which they agreed. However, my parents have always been quite overprotective, and sometimes treat me a bit too much like I'm 12, especially regarding things like screens. They have been somewhat invasive in the past sometimes, measuring my screen time very closely, if I messed up or forgot a task they'd immediately tell me to show them the time I'd spent on my phone (they still do this sometimes, honestly). They've also resorted to rummaging through my stuff in the past sometimes too, they're good parents overall, I wouldn't call it abuse and these moments aren't as common as good moments, I'd just say they're just imperfections of theirs (and frankly, it's more my mom than my dad).

Ever since I went into uni last month, I've noticed a little more freedom on my part, in the sense that I was left to my space more often, but after speaking to my parents, my mom said to me ""This means, however, I'll also be checking your weekly planners and assignments in a more intensive way"". I'm just scared they're gonna start weaponizing my potential diagnosis to exert more control over me under the guise of ""you could be neurodivergent"".

This is my fear, it's a bit small I guess, but it'd be genuinely embarrassing to have a 2 hour limit on your phone every day at the big age of 18.

PS: They also commented they highly doubted I was autistic because I was a very open and social kid as a child, but I think I was like that because I didn't get social cues? I didn't know what was acceptable, when a joke stopped being funny, etc. This is more of a side question to see if anyone had a similar experience as a child to mine. But any help on these two questions is appreciated.";;;;
2025-11-01 16:57:36;At the ripe age of 30, I was diagnosed with ASD. Some thoughts, feelings, and questions.;"Yesterday, I got my official diagnosis. After many different tests, interviews, ruling out other conditions, I finally have an answer to what the hell is ""wrong"" with me. I was suspecting I might be on the spectrum for a long time, but I didn't expect the wave of emotions that hit me once I heard the result. 

  
I'm really happy with the person who was in charge of my assessment. While researching online, I've read a lot of horror stories of half assed interviews, outdated views on autism etc. I got really lucky, because the psychologist in charge was very knowledgeable and he explained things in a really clear matter. He even made sure to explain the criteria which he'll be using, complaining about how some of them are imperfect or out of date.

  
One thing that shocked me quite a bit was how I did with the intelligence test. All my life I was treated like an idiot. People around me didn't understand me, my ways of looking at things never made sense to others, not to mention countless institution/office workers laughing at me for not being able to fill out a form or people being surprised I lack an obvious skill. You can imagine how shocked I was, when the psychologist told me that I scored above average. 

  
Yesterday I had a call with my psychologist and it turns out that I'm autistic. He said that he has no doubts about his diagnosis, because of everything we ruled out and how I scored on some of the test and questionaires. He also said that I'm exceptionally good at masking, because I was able to keep good eye contact, although do it less than is considered a norm. That also surprised me, because I thought I let my defenses down a bit for the assessment, and the eye contact felt very awkward. 

  
In general, the diagnosis is a positive, at least right now. I finally have some answers to why I am the way I am, and some relief that comes with the news of not being broken, just being different. It feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally breathe. There's also some anxiety tied to not being sure on how to proceed, what to expect, what's next. 

  
Only recently I started educating myself more on autism and how it affects people. Only when the diagnosis was being in process, I started looking at methods of coping with different things and giving myself more space to process things in a different way. That's also why I'd like to ask some questions to other late-diagnosed adults here.



First and foremost - if I thought I'm letting my guard down, and I still came across as ""exceptionally good at masking"", then how the hell do I actually unmask and drop the act?

  
What are some things that help you in your day-to-day life? Big or small, doesn't matter.

  
What are some of your favorite free resources online for understanding autism in adults more? 

  
And also - any tips and advice on how to move forward are appreciated. Feel free to share your stories and experiences, what worked, what didn't. I'm open to hear it all. :) ";;;;
2025-11-01 12:05:11;Excitement?;"Hey, first time posting here. I'm not diagnosed, but I am in the process of getting tested for autism. One of the things that has stuck out to me (that may or may not be related, but it is a social issue) is that I've never really known how to show excitement around other people. In fact, the older I get, the less I find anything really exciting. I get excited about animals or good food but not much else, including surprises or gifts. When presented with a surprise gift or compliment, I just sort of don't react? I have to really work to remind myself that if I don't at least thank the person in the moment that I may upset them, but other than saying thanks, I never know what to say or do.

And if you ask me what I think in the moment, I don't have an answer. I need to process and think about it for a while. Even if I got a gift that I really wanted or something I do like happens, I don't have a positive initial reaction. I'm also not going to pretend to be happy that someone complimented a feature that I don't like about myself or pretend to be excited about a gift I didn't ask for. And I think it shows in my body language really bad. What is the expected reaction? What do you say if the nice gesture is unwanted? I never really want to be complimented, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, but it doesn't seem to be acceptable to tell people that.

Can anyone relate?";;;;
2025-11-01 11:59:44;struggling with loneliness as an 18yo AuDHDer;"this is mostly a vent post. i don't know if that requires a tw, but I figured I'd warn you anyway. This has negative self-talk, mentions my struggles with autism as a lsn autistic person.

I don't wanna keep venting to my friend so I'm venting here and asking for advice while I'm at it

I'm a LSN (low support needs) 18yo AuDHD girl. I only found out I was autistic last spring. I've been diagnosed ADHD since I was 6, but there was still a lot of bias within the medical community at the time, and not much knowledge surrounding neurodivergence, especially in girls, women, adults, etc. But that's besides the point.

  
I've cried so many times wishing I wasn't autistic. It's incredibly isolating. I'm relatively social, or at least want to be because of my adhd and just my personality. But I can't keep up with everyone because of my autism. 

My life has been one big inner circle that I can't get in. I can't get along with \*most\* neurotypicals because of my sturggles with communication. I don't put neurotypicals at ease when I talk to them. I'm ass at eye contact, small talk can be difficult for me. Sometimes i need jokes explained to me. I have trouble processing what people say to me, so conversations just don't flow well. I heard another person describe being lsn as being trapped in a glass box your whole life so no one can talk to you and vice versa. This is what my life has felt like for the whole 18 years I've been alive. No neurotypical could EVER understand that feeling. NEVER. There's truly nothing like it. You can't really replicate it or understand unless you're on the spectrum too imo

  
What takes the cake is that i get this sinking feeling around other autistics and adhders too. All my friends are either autistic, adhd, or both. I still don't fit in with them. I don't get their references. I don't play the games they play. I'm autistic enough for neurotypicals to hate me and not autistic enough to fit in.

when i was in hs i got by by just going to school, but I need more socialization now. If i went to college immediately after hs I would've likely continued with the same pattern, usually not seeing anyone after school, not joining any clubs, etc. But now I wanna do everything I can to make friends. part of it is because I can't imagine living without any friends. I don't have a partner and probably won't for a while. My family is alright, but I don't usually see them much even though I live at home.

  
I'm just so damn sad. I've been so sad ever since i finally put the pieces together while I was figuring out that i could be on the spectrum too. I grieved for so so so long, and I still am sometimes. I grieved for my 6-year-old self who wondered what was ""wrong"" with her, but could never figure it out. It's so fucking isolating and there's really nothing like it. It feels like a prison that goes everywhere with me. I can never escape. I am always bound by my poor communication and cluelessness. I never take initiative when it comes to going from acquaintances to friends with people. It's like going to a four-way-stop and having no idea when your turn is. I worry abiut being too clingy and desparate when it comes to going from acquaintances to friends. I always worry I scare people away when I try to cross that bridge

the autistic (lsn in my case) experience is truly like nothing else. I think you have to be on the spectrum too to get it. I have a desire to be social. I wanna get out there and make friends and stay out late hanging out with people. I wanna have fun and meet people. I want it so fucking bad.  I know I'm lucky to have friends but no matter where I go i'm still alone. Part of it is my fault. I don't try very hard to fit in with my friends. I'm barely online because I can't be considering that anything short-form or that can be scrolled is like crack for me. I can't stop. I'll scroll all day, I wish I was joking. I can't keep up with internet culture or these references my friends are using. 

I could try harder, but I just don't. I just hope they don't forget about me because I moved half an hour away from all of them.

I'm afraid of seeming desperate and pushing my only friends away. 

I'm sort of in a friend group with a bunch of nd people that i mentioned earlier, they're into superheroes and pokemon and all kinds of things I know nothing about. I don't see them much, and when I do, it's not for long. I have the strictest parents out of all of them. While they get to do sleepovers and stay up god knows how late, I'm on the highway heading home at 9:30. every, fucking, time. it doesn't matter where I am, who I'm with or what I'm doung, i'm guaranteed to be the first person to leave. the fomo has always gotten to me (how can it not??!)

it's a miracle that i get really any human interaction in besides my parents. It's rare, especially considering I'm not in school yet. I came back to my old job which has been helping with my social isolation but man I am still so frustrated. the fact I can't stay out past 10pm, considering the to see my friends, that'd be more like 9:15-9:30. it's been driving me nuts, but I guess that's part of growing up?



  
my question (if you made it through the yapathon) is where do I go from here?

do i ask to stay out later? do i ask my friends to hang out often? do I do nothing and take what I get? do I try to keep up with this one friend group, or just accept that I'm not really interested in the same things as them? 

I don't really know as silly as that sounds.

have a good night and happy halloween, if you spent it alone, i know the struggle and could bitch and complain about it all night. in other words, I know what it's like and hope you're doing okay. Try to make the most of it if you can, I know it's hard and it sucks ass.

sincerely, yet another isolated autistic person :')";;;;
2025-11-01 10:07:06;Could this be Asperger’s or just anxiety/social awkwardness?;"Hey everyone,

I’ve been wondering if some of my traits might fit somewhere on the spectrum, or if it’s more just anxiety and personality. I’d really appreciate some perspective. Does anaybody feel like me?

Here’s a bit about me:

* I really like soccer/football.
* I love going to stadiums — the noise, the drums, the chants. I even yell at players (nothing mean, just part of the game).
* I always go to the same spot in the stadium; it feels comforting and familiar.
* I enjoy music and occasionally play piano.
* But outside of that environment, I struggle a lot with social stuff.
* I feel uncomfortable in group settings and do much better one-on-one.
* Talking to strangers is really hard. Maintaining eye contact is difficult, even with the few friends i have.
* It’s even harder to talk to the opposite sex — I just freeze up.
* I fidget a lot (tap my foot, move my hands).
* In social situations, I often feel like I need to “escape” after a while.
* I like hugs, sometimes i give hugs  but at the same time they can feel uncomfortable or awkward.
* I often have no idea what to say in conversations, and it’s hard to come up with topics or small talk, even with family.

So I’m wondering — do these sound like traits of someone with Asperger’s/autism, or could this just be social anxiety and introversion?

I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just trying to understand myself better";;;;
2025-11-01 08:56:00;Wondering - does the (real) masking yourself feels you uncomfortable?;"Since I was little kid I hated to mask myself during Halloween. When I was in kindergarten caregiver made me a moustache and I washed it away right away. 

Im 41 now, recently diagnosed with autism, and today is Halloween. It makes me think....is this something to do with too much sensory input or something. Carnivals and maskenballs (and yes, clowns but thats a given) were always a bit cringy and creepy to me. Anything in costume makes me feel uncomfortable and unnatural.

Is that something to do with autism or just my personality? ";;;;
2025-11-01 03:18:37;That weird post-diagnosis doubt nobody warns you about;"I got my diagnosis recently (ASD Level 1/Aspergers, however you prefer to call it) and honestly, I already knew before the assessment that it would come out positive. It just made too much sense. The evaluation confirmed exactly what I’d noticed about myself for years.

But still, there’s this strange background feeling of doubt. Like a quiet thought that maybe I’m somehow faking it, or exaggerating, or not “autistic enough.” Which is ridiculous, because I know it fits. I’ve even read that a lot of autistic people feel this exact same way which makes it even more confusing, because it perfectly describes my experience again.

Some of my friends reacted very differently, too. A few said things like, “Wow, I’d never have thought that,” or even before the diagnosis, “I don’t think you’ll actually get one.” Others immediately went, “Yeah, that makes total sense,” or “Of course, that explains a lot.” So the mix of disbelief and confirmation from others somehow adds to the weird self-doubt, like I’m stuck between knowing and second-guessing it at the same time and this in itself is a confusing experience. 

Does anyone else have that? How do you deal with the feeling that you might be faking or exaggerating something that you know to be valid and true? ";;;;
2025-11-01 02:47:18;Xmas 2026;"It's Halloween...so practically Xmas. But sod Halloween. Where I am at it was not a thing when I was growing up (and THANK YOU Odin for that). It is a tiny bit with the younger folks nowadays but....I am not part of the younger folks category. So.....

Xmas is two months away which means that from next weeks shops will start selling Xmas junk which will go to the dump in January. To that add a run to Black Friday. Hail Capitalism. All this ""noise"" and media bombing can get too much to me. But back to Xmas. I never understood the hype, or at least never got excited about Xmas. Dad loved it - I always think of him more these days which is both a good and a bad thing. I enjoy the downtime I get during Xmas week, and it is a week I do my best to not get social. It got better in recent years on that front. 

The thing about this Xmas though is that it is special. It is my first Autistic Xmas. I got my diagnosis earlier this year. And it has been mostly a good year. After the diagnosis I decided to let go of stuff and activites which stress me and live a bit ""to own tune"", if that is a good way to say it, more openly. And boy do I feel less stressed! I am feeling a nudge to sort of get back out A BIT and I certainly need to get into some exercise.

Anyways. The whole point of this was that it is my first Autistic Xmas. I just realised a few minuted ago and I smiled that internal smile to myself.

Thank you for reading if you got to here.";;;;
2025-11-01 01:55:58;Should I get a diagnosis?;"hi! so, I was talking with some friends last night and I realized that I think I'm autistic..? I've always thought I was so that wasn't new to me, but I never thought anyone else would see it because I never felt like it was bad, but all my friends have been saying i show severe signs of autism, and I don't know if I should get tested for it, even if it's just to finally know what's wrong with me i guess? 

I even took some online tests and well, I have a list on my phone of all the ones I've taken and basically they all say I have severe signs of autism and I've taken more than 20. I've taken 28 to be exact. 

So, for those diagnosed, is it worth getting a diagnosis or should I just leave it and not get diagnosed? I don't know if it's generally worth getting diagnosed or something. Also, sorry if my post makes no sense, idk how to word this out I have trouble putting my thoughts to words like this. you can ask my any questions and I can hopefully try to answer them correctly.";;;;
2025-11-01 00:52:39;Addictions and Quitting - Am I Alone?;"AuDHD diagnosed late in life, in my early 30s, currently late 30s and have learned a lot about myself over that time.

I know this neurological profile comes with a higher degree of association for addictive behaviors and risks, which has borne out through my life at time (e.g. opiates, nicotine, caffeine, adderall all have been items I've been ""chemically"" addicted to).

*My question:* While I've been hooked on these things at time that are known addictive items, that many many neurotypicals have a hard time quitting - I've observed that _every single one_ the moment I decided I wanted to quit... I just did. It was similar to the sensation of when one of my ADHD style hyperfocus interests just stops... it just drops off a cliff and ceases to exist in my mind.

So I'm just wondering - is this a common phenomenon with AuDHD / Autistic individuals? Doesnt really change anything for me, but I'm genuinely curious about the experiences others have had.";;;;
2025-11-01 00:12:29;Ways to help  in everyday life;"I’m 32yrs old and female. I was diagnosed late so no help from home and school. I work in transport at the moment and I feel like I’ve never really been taught how to look after my home (cook, clean and budget) I’ve only just started not long ago brushing my teeth once with no reminders each day and every time I go towards those neuro apps (Finch) I pay for it and then barely use it. 

I have no support. In Australia we have the NDIS. I always got rejected and I’m in debt, and just need help to learn. I have no support from work and am working overstimulated and consistently exhausted.

2025-10-31 22:20:12;Is it reasonable to consider my IQ score a “minimum” if I was extremely anxious during the test?;"Hi everyone

I recently took a standard IQ test and scored 102. I’m perfectly fine accepting this score as it is, but I’m curious about something.

During the test, I experienced extremely high anxiety. At one point, my mind went completely blank and I was in full panic mode. It resulted that the area where I scored lowest was processing speed.

This test was part of a broader neurodivergence assessment, during which I was diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger’s.

Given all that, is it reasonable to think that this score might reflect a “minimum” under stress rather than my actual potential? I understand that anxiety can affect performance, but I would like some perspective from people familiar with IQ testing or cognitive psychology.";;;;
2025-10-31 20:36:21;Did anyone else's autism not get picked up by multiple medical professionals?;"In my teen years and early 20s, I went through therapy multiple times for anxiety and depression, was also diagnosed with PTSD. Perhaps the overlap in PTSD symptoms and autism symptoms made my autism harder to spot?

But bizarrely, it was never even suggested to me by those professionals that I might have autism. I saw multiple therapists, assessors, psychologists, doctors, etc. They would have seen me not making eye contact, being very withdrawn, monotonous, etc.

The first person who asked me if I might have autism was a counsellor who I had one session with at university. Of course I brushed it off at the time, because I had very little understanding of autism, and just assumed that my previous diagnoses of anxiety, depression and PTSD covered my issues and challenges already.

In the end I ended up being diagnosed with autism at age 27. I sometimes wonder how different things might be if I got my diagnosis earlier, perhaps even when I was at school? Surely there should be better training in place to help spot autism? ";;;;
2025-10-31 18:45:51;What should I do now?;"I'm 15 and my middle school years were an absolute mess. I couldn't make any friends or even have a normal conversation with classmates.

I also developed depression. The hardest part is that I wasn't bullied; I just felt like it was all my own fault. My grades were awful too.

When I started high school, the same thing happened. One night, I broke down, took all my meds at school, and passed out. My parents pulled me out and arranged a leave of absence.

During this time, I started researching. My older brother was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD, and I noticed my traits are very similar. I took some screening tests, and the results strongly suggest I might have ASD and ADHD. I plan to get a formal diagnosis soon.

I feel so lost right now. Even if I get the diagnosis, what next? A diagnosis letter might bring some relief, but I'm worried about my future. When my leave is over, I'll probably just end up repeating the cycle.

My parents are supportive about seeing a doctor, but they see this as something curable, like anxiety or depression. They constantly push me to go back to school and be social. They just don't understand.

I don't know what to do next. Any advice is welcome.";;;;
2025-10-31 16:52:39;Trouble understanding the EIALA/self-diagnosis discourse;"Disclaimer: this post is a think-out-loud, the culmination of my months-long dive into topics and communities surrounding neurodiversity (namely ASD and ADHD). I was raised in an environment where mental health is still hush hush/stigmatized, so I hope the following don't comes off as offensive, insensitive or antagonizing, and welcome any clarification or extra information.

It is quite ironic that the neurodivergent space hosts one of the most muddled and nuanced controversy about the very nature of its identity. I get that those who see it as trendy and spread misrepresentation via bad taste imitations only for clout is damaging for everyone, but even if we exclude them from the conversation it seems that people are still not satisfied (I will come back to this issue later).

I'll focus on ASD since I'm more confident about the information I have. It started out only covering the more detectable and interruptive symptoms (today's level 3), then gradually expanded to other atypical mental structures due to the advancement of diagnosis processes and the inability to define a solid boundary- afaik there is no known mechanisms that consistently link to specific behaviors. Autism is a spectrum, not a gradient, as in it has a wide range of presentations when criteria are met, instead of a linear scale from ""not"" to ""very"". ""Everyone is a bit autistic"" is objectively incorrect in the same way as ""everyone is a bit over 180cm tall"".

But it is correct that ""everyone has a non-zero positive dimension in the vertical axis"" right? I see almost no objections to the idea that autistic experiences are human experiences, just at a very different intensity. And the expansion of the spectrum to catch more people that can somewhat function but would still benefit from some assistance is generally seen as a good thing too.

And yet, one of the strong opposition to self diagnosis claims that it's not according to official criteria and procedures, therefore it's validity is questionable. I've looked it up and it seems like one needs to hit every main criteria and a specific ratio/combination of sub criteria to lead to a positive diagnosis. Is this really as reliable as they claim? Doesn't it leave a lot of holes for people in need to fall out of? Do people who are 179cm tall not face similar situations as 180cm ones? Isn't the whole point to help more people to the best of our abilities?

This might just be one big goomba fallacy, which is to be expected from such a divided topic. Everytime it is brought up the discussion can steer in completely different directions, and it doesn't appear often enough for me to gauge a rough consensus. Not to mention those with high support needs are often not able to chime in at all. After the entire thought process above, my questions boil down to the following:

1. Is it really the right move to lump all of this into one spectrum that is prone to overgeneralization and lead to illusions of resource conflict?
2. Do people deserve less accommodation for the same issue because they are undiagnosed? Yes, even those who try to fake it because they can relate to a few experiences.
3. Is there seriously anyone, neurotypical or not, that truly feel unhindered in today's environment?
4. If someone mastered masking so well that they don't even mind/notice it anymore, is the opportunity to unmask still valuable for them?

If you managed to read this far without rate quitting, thanks and sorry. I don't really know what I expect as a response, but it's time I get it out there.";;;;
2025-10-31 13:45:13;What is with the number/date questions in the Autism diagnostic test? (and other strange vague questions);"So I got diagnosed AuDHD and the test honestly was hard (?) not sure if the same test is used for everyone but because it makes you answer ''yes, no, or sometimes'' it feels like convoluted?? 

I'm very bad at math, can't do it for shit so I was curious why it kept asking like ''do you really like numbers?'' Or ''are you obsessed with dates?'' Like what does that even mean???? I don't know how to answer that because like that's so vague??? Like dates just like as the concept, no? Not even a little, but like dates when it comes to history then I guess I'm pretty interested because I like history??

Or like one of the other weird ones was ''are you good at playing imaginary games with children?'' Like so are you asking me this question with emphasis on imaginary or children? Because I'm awesome at playing with children but I don't really tend to do imaginary or pretend type games, I'm more of an arts and craft type person (?) - in the same vain there was another that asked ''did you like to play pretend with other kids when you were a child?'' And it's like once again what is the focus? Playing pretend or playing with other kids? Because I loved playing pretend but not with other kids? I wanted to play by myself.

I feel like I was thinking too hard about these questions so I was confusing myself because I wasn't sure what they were asking.";;;;
2025-10-31 11:53:24;Autism and workplace communication — feeling targeted;"Hey everyone,
I could really use some advice.

I’m autistic and have already told my boss about my diagnosis, but I’m still finding work really difficult lately. It feels like some of my coworkers don’t “get me,” and it’s starting to feel like I’m being targeted and misunderstood because of it.

Recently, my boss talked to me about a few complaints — but when we discussed the actual situations, the real issue seemed to be communication differences. And that’s the frustrating part… because communication challenges are literally part of autism (“characterized by differences or difficulties in social communication and interaction”).

This isn’t the first time it’s happened, and I’m not sure how to handle it anymore. How do you advocate for yourself in the workplace when you’ve already disclosed your autism, but people still seem to interpret your communication style negatively?

Any strategies, phrases, or personal experiences that helped you would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance.

2025-10-31 09:24:34;Living Abroad and Seeking an Autism Diagnosis;I am an adult, 30 years old, living abroad in foreign country and working for a foreign company. It’s very hard to find adequate mental health services here so I usually look online. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in high school. At that time they diagnosed it as ADD because they had a distinction. My ADHD was never much of a problem when I was in high school, but became more of a problem in college. When I was in high school and later in college, I took medication for my ADHD and I guess because the demands that were asked of me, were not so great I was able to function well, even though a lot of people found me very intense. But my life has become progressively more difficult as I’ve gotten older. I had a very difficult time, socializing and understanding myself in college because I did not have the structure that my family had provided . Now that I’m pursuing my career, I find it really hard to manage myself in my jobs, I am constantly overwhelmed by everything I have to do in life. I find it difficult to do tasks that require a lot of thought, I get overwhelmed in social situations often. It’s interesting because Im a very spontaneous person and I love adventures, but I also do get very overwhelmed by the situations I often put myself in. I recently had another breakdown where I just exploded in a fit of anger that ended my relationship. This is a repeating pattern in my life. I’ve gone through therapy before, but I never did therapy that specifically addressed my problems with ADHD. As I begin the process of trying to better understand how to cope in a world with my brain I would like to know if there is more going on than ADHD. I become a little suspicious that I might also have signs of autism. However, autism screenings seem to be very expensive. I don’t have insurance through the US. Are there any other options out there for me?;;;;

I have a hard time understanding what people tell me verbally. Didactic was very hard for me already and I’m bad when it comes to simulation.

2025-10-31 05:07:02;Autistic maybe?;So a couple years back my son was diagnosed as level 1 autistic. After a lot of meditation on it I was able to accept it (not that anything is wrong with it, just tough to hear as a parent). In the time following I went down a deep rabbit hole on the subject of autism. In my research I ran across a statistic that said something like 80% of kids diagnosed have one undiagnosed parent. So, I found an online questionnaire through autism speaks website. I took it, and it suggested I see my physician. I thought, nah, so I took another slightly longer one, it also said to visit my doctor. Still didn’t believe it, so I took a third even more in depth one and yet again I scored above the average score for autistics. My wife took 1 and had zero chance of autism. I don’t really believe it because I talk to anyone and everyone and share a lot about myself and make eye contact. After more research I am realizing I may be on the overly social and over sharing end of things. Anyways, I am 37 and have functioned in life without knowing so far, but now I feel like I want a diagnosis just so I know one way or the other. When I think about doing this though I feel like i am an imposter and that I may be gaslighting myself, even though family members told me that me having autism would actually make sense 🤦🏻‍♂️.  Just trying to vent here, thanks for reading my long winded post. ;;;;
2025-10-31 03:48:35;Testing question;"Had an intake appointment to for testing. I'm largely self diagnosed, however, I have 10 children and everyone is neurodivergent, I have had signs since early childhood but combined with being an 80's kid and medical neglect here we are. 

The (male) provider sat in on the first 15 min of the appointment. He is the same provider that did my daughter's testing  (8) appointment last year. At the end of it his only comment was how clearly I communicated to him/how verbal I was and how that was atypical for autism. He said the same thing at my daughter's appointment. He is in his 70's for reference. I completed the remainder of the intake was given the forms for my husband and I to complete and I go back in 2 weeks for 3 hours of further eval & testing. At the very end I voiced my concern that there is going to be bias and that he basically isn't current in his information and his information for women of my age group. 
She told me ""blah blah blah worked with him a long time he does an amazing job and no bias"" that's true for males as well. 
Not for high functioning. Not for 44 yo who have spent their whole life masking. 
She even made me define ""masking"" to her. Which honestly kind of felt demeaning. I have a bachelors degree. Work in healthcare and have obsessively researched this for years for my children. It's a life hyper focus. They also seemed to latch on to the fact that I have had a lot of trauma in the last 2 years and we haven't even touched a toe into my history. 

Like do I run screaming? Do I trust the forms? Trust the process? Drive 2-3 hours?  Find an online testing site? We live in a fairly rural area so this is it for me for options. The fact that I'm over analyzing to this extent is okay normal but? 


This was just extraordinarily difficult for me to take this step. Now I don't want to go back.

2025-10-31 02:48:46;Teen ADOS-2;"Today my daughter (12F) took the ADOS-2 test but the psychologist called us again because my daughter has not cooperated at all. 

He has told me that he has shown selective mutism, answering only ""yes/no"" and ""taekwondo"" when asked about his hobbies. He told me that this is also part of the diagnosis, in addition to other things he has seen (no eye contact, he continually wrapped his hair around his finger, he moved his fingers without stopping, a tick in his eye...) 

I felt very helpless when she asked me if the girl speaks fluently...she talks a lot with me, but she doesn't speak with strangers, so we have agreed that we will make another attempt, with me present. 

At least he told me that he doesn't see anything very narcissistic, since we come from a previous diagnosis of TPN and that on the contrary, he thought she was a vulnerable girl who was having a really bad time. 

The girl is aware of the process, but she asks me not to go to any more psychologists (the TPN experience negatively affected her), however, I clearly see that my daughter needs adaptations at school, in fact this course has changed stage and center and she already has 2 absences for ""not answering the teacher's questions."" 

How can I make her feel safe and talk to this new professional who is treating her with a lot of respect and empathy? I don't know how to help her and I feel like the worst mother in the world...";;;;
2025-10-31 02:35:53;This is my story life asd in vietnam;"My name is Huy Nguyen, and I am from Vietnam. I am an autistic adult, high-functioning, who has spent most of my life misunderstood, isolated, and struggling to find a place where I truly belong. I work as a travel tour designer for international guests, and in my free time, I love collecting whisky and model cars, drawing, cycling, and taking quiet walks in nature. I’m sharing my story not for pity, but to let others who live with autism—especially in places where it’s rarely understood—know that they are not alone. I never got to choose where my life began. My father left before I was born and told my mother to abort me. She refused and raised me alone, in hardship, fear, and anger. From as early as I can remember, I was lonely. I never had a single friend from kindergarten until the end of high school. Every day, I sat alone, played alone, and went home alone. My first “friend” was a small pink stuffed pig that my mother gave me. I took it to class every day, hugged it, talked to it—because it was the only thing that never judged me. But the person who gave me that toy also caused me the deepest scars. My mother often beat me—for eating too slowly, for not studying well, for simply not listening. Sometimes she hit me until I bled, until the bath water turned red with my own blood. Once, she hit me while I was wearing glasses, and the frame cut deep into my skin near my eye. Her words still echo inside me: “You’re useless. You’re not my child. You’re stupid. You don’t deserve to exist.” I grew up afraid of footsteps, afraid of her voice. Home was not a safe place—it was a battlefield. At school, I was bullied, mocked, and isolated. Classmates called me weird, slow, strange. The only person I thought was my friend betrayed me, spreading lies until everyone avoided me. Once, I was even physically attacked in class; my uncle had to intervene to stop it. When I went to college, I completely shut down. For almost nine years, I lived in silence, avoiding people, avoiding trust. I was terrified of rejection, betrayal, and misunderstanding. I also developed a severe skin disease—eczema—since I was thirteen. It worsened over time until my legs were infected and nearly amputated. I spent three months in a wheelchair. I was so hopeless that I once stood on a hospital balcony, ready to jump, but someone pulled me back. That moment saved my life, though I didn’t realize it then. Much later, I was finally diagnosed with ASD—Autism Spectrum Disorder—high functioning. It explained everything. Why I always felt different. Why noise, chaos, or lies made me panic. Why I couldn’t express emotions like others but felt everything too deeply inside. I have never met my father. He denied I was his child. I just wish I could see his face once—to understand the man who didn’t want me to exist. My life has been a chain of wounds, physical and emotional. No siblings, no true friends, no one who truly understood. Relatives used to laugh at me when my mother shouted at me. When I tried to open up, people mocked me: “Your story isn’t that bad,” or “You just need to be stronger.” They never understood that I’ve already been strong for more than twenty years. Even after I started working—designing tours for international travelers—the loneliness never left. I earned little but worked honestly. I asked my mother for help sometimes, but every request turned into guilt and shouting: “I gave you food and a house—what more do you want?” or “You should work harder like other people.” or “You’re spoiled and lazy.” If I did something right, I was praised. If I failed, I was worthless again. Even after learning I had autism, my mother didn’t truly understand. She met therapists five or six times, but nothing changed. She still believed I was just stubborn, not different. She compared me to other autistic people, saying, “Look at them! They can do better than you!” and every word dug deeper into my heart. Living in Vietnam as a person with ASD feels like living behind an invisible wall. Society doesn’t understand. Schools don’t teach empathy. The government offers no real support. We exist, but we are unseen. Still, I am here. Still alive. Still trying to believe that my life has meaning. Because even if the world doesn’t understand me, I know I’m not broken, just different. And I believe that people like me deserve respect, love, and a voice. Recently, something changed. I met Juliette, the President of NeuroConvergences, an international organization for neurodivergent people—autistic, ADHD, PDA, and more. She read my story and said: “You could even do a webinar or something—there are many possibilities. I’m 100% for this. If you want to share your story, you can do it in the ‘lived experience’ server and introduce yourself.” For the first time in my life, someone didn’t tell me to “be normal.” Someone said: “Just be the most real Huy you can be.” That sentence changed everything. Because maybe, for once, I don’t need to hide anymore. Maybe I don’t have to fight to be accepted—I just have to be myself. So here I am, sharing my story—not for pity, but for truth. For every autistic person who has been told they’re lazy, broken, or strange. For every child who was beaten for being different. For every adult who still feels like they don’t belong anywhere. If you are one of them, please know this: You are not alone. You are not defective. You are not less than anyone else. You are simply you, and that is enough. Because sometimes, just surviving is already an act of courage.

2025-10-31 02:18:54;Participants needed! self vs professional diagnosis affect on mental health outcomes;"Hello!

We are doing a research project on differences in outcomes in those self-diagnosed and those with a professional diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. We are with the University of Lynchburg and this study has received IRB approval. We are curious to see the differences in mental health outcomes between the diagnostic groups. This is important to study because autistic people are already at an increased risk of mental health struggles, and there are many barriers to receiving a diagnosis as an adult so more people are relying on self-diagnosis. We will also study how masking can influence these outcomes. We want to see what role diagnosis plays in the overall well-being of people with autism. 

The only requirements for taking part in this study are having either a **1) professional diagnosis or 2) be self-diagnosed with autism, as well as being 18+. Furthermore, you are not eligible to participate if you reside in the EU or UK.** It should only take about 20 minutes and we would be very appreciative if you took part!  
Informed consent and our emails for any questions is provided at the beginning of the survey, as well as mental health resources. You may exit the Google Form at any point and participation is completely voluntary. This study will be open until February 2026, and a follow up of results will be posted.

2025-10-30 23:38:51;Reached 31 and thought maybe just maybe I lucked out.. but alas diagnosed with Hypermobile Elher's Dahnlos Syndrome lmao;So yeah um a percentage of autistic people have hEDS, which means really bad pain and joint dislocations and nerve issues body wide. So welp I am not one of the lucky ones who make it relatively unscathed into middle and old age. Anyone else with hEDS and what age did you get diagnosed?;;;;
2025-10-30 22:44:08;Help;"Hi everyone Zenyth here
I am a school student and I have an issue 
Everytime I'm at the school or mall or anywhere public I generally prefer keeping my ears covered with earphones because the sounds are too loud and lights are too bright which lead me to rock back and forth unknowingly, clapping, chanting, finger flicking,hand movements,etc and I suddenly have troubles reading and all I hear is muffled noise, I start hitting my head and every sharp sounds echoes in my ear
So I wanted to ask if anyone else feels this and what this is ( this has been since childhood but I notice it more now due to my environment)
My triggers:
Powder,paste,grease touching on skin,sharp and sudden noises and bright lights 

Note: I'm not a diagnosed autist as I've been told I don't look autistic but here are my scores on self assessment tests
RAADS- 222 (216 on previous test)
CATQ- 151
AQ- 45/50
RDOS V5- 162
( I know these aren't diagnostic tools, I'm not using them for that purpose I just need to know what I'm dealing with)

As per my research this seems to be a sensory overload but I want to make sure by those who are clinically diagnosed with the condition ";;;;
2025-10-30 20:56:05;How to handle meltdowns or just insane rages?;"Hello, I am diagnosed with aspergers and I always get meltdowns after a while. It seems better for a while. Like I can function normally and everything. It feels like usual situation. Then suddenly I snap a pencil that is in my hand or crush an apple that I am holding, start screaming, howling, punching holes into my wardrobe, break stuff...   
  
That initial burst of extreme anger is just too much to handle. All I manage is to not punch people/animals around me or not smash windows or something expensive. (That energy I got inside is insane, I would probably hospitalize somebody if I punched them in that state. I smashed through wooden doors in the past. Getting my joints all clicky and blue.)   
  
After the initial insane rage has passed, I can usually calm down with exercise like pushups.. Then I usually feel miserable about what fucking insanity I just did. I usually go find my dog, who is hiding somewhere shaking to calm her down.

I honestly do not know how to handle this better. Even if I try to manage these meltdowns, I got zero understanding from people around me. Who for example push me to do the next little thing, even when I communicate that I am on the edge, that I need to calm down and a break. People often tell me I do these things on purpose and that I am lazy, which is not the case. Often life just will not get me take a break. I do not want to take the medication called impotencine to fix it.

When I was a child, this was particularly brutal. I often got meltdowns, did not know what was happening. Then my parents would yell at me afterwards, what kind of bastard I am. I felt horrible, miserable, I always thought I am a psychopath, that is what my parents told me when I was little. That people like me grow up to be murderers and such.

I usually do not feel so crushed inside now. But I still feel miserable about causing trauble and making others scared. It is a horrible feeling to get these meltdowns and just not be able to let that energy go. Its just I try to stay calm, I try to act as expected, I try to do things right and suddenly a meltdown. I cannot fucking even think straight during these meltdowns. :/ That is in part why I have not been able to resolve the issue yet.

How do you handle meltdowns? Do you take impotencine (antidepressant, antipsychotics)?";;;;

2025-10-30 14:12:26;Service and Supports available for autistic adults (my experience);"When talking about adult autism diagnosis, I frequently see the claim made that there are no services for low support needs autistic adults. This is a myth. There are many kinds of services available for autistic adults. However, there are significant issues with access to these services. Services might not be available in all geographic locations, there might not be enough resources available, or cost might be prohibitive. These are all huge problems and valid concerns. But it does not mean that there are no supports or services for autistic adults. 

I was diagnosed when I was 17 (I’m now 30) so almost all the autism services I’ve received have been as an adult. Every autistic person is unique with a unique set of needs, but these are the services I have received as a low support needs autistic adult along with how they were funded: 

- college accommodations (free)
- One on one support in college through a special autism program (private pay)
- Social groups: fun activities in the community with other autistic people with the help of a mentor (low cost or free through local autism organizations)
- Vocational rehabilitation: assistance with job exploration, job searching, interviewing, paid 2 week working interviews, and a job coach, (free from state government)
- Occupational therapy: worked on sensory issues and executive functioning (paid for by medical insurance)
- Social skills classes (one covered under my full college scholarship, others private pay)
- Speech and language therapy (private pay)
- Loans from an assistive technology library (free through the state) 
- A residential transition program: lived in an apartment on the program campus. Received supports in all areas of life skills such as cooking, banking, apartment maintenance, bus transportation, and social communication skills. Social recreation activities on campus and in the community. (Private pay and very expensive.)
- Supported living: drop in support enabling me to live in my own apartment. (Private pay, in the process of getting state funding.)
- Accommodations for air travel and navigating airports (free)
- Psychiatrist/medication management at an autism clinic (covered by medical insurance.) 
- An autism service dog specifically trained for me by a non profit organization (private pay, though reduced cost through the non profit and in the process of fundraising.) 
- Sensory friendly performances of plays (reduced cost tickets) 

The rest are services or supports I have received because of my autism, but are not strictly autism specific:
- reduced bus fair
- Free transportation to medical appointments 
- Medicaid 
- supplemental security income (SSI)
- SNAP (food stamps)

I’m happy do go more in depth about any of these services is anyone has any questions. ";;;;
2025-10-30 12:35:34;Survival guide to PDA - please help!;"Dont be intimidated by this post, i cant help mysel but to overxplain. I have tldr, but hopefully you will try and read it, just might save my life, literally.

I am 41 years old and I finally diagnosed with autism. One of the things my therapist told I certainly have is PDA. Pathological Demand Avoidance. 

And I think I got it pretty serious. 
My whole life i had so many different diagnosis and this really helped me. 
But, why I say serious? It affects me in most important stuff in life. Im afraid of anything. I cannot find a job, I always live in fear to meet new people and new places....and mobing. Sometimes I get so mad someone pressures me i get in fight or flight situation. 
Thats something I really cannot afford myself in this age. 

In other situations too. Especially Types of demands include: 
""An internal demand (for example willing yourself to do something such as take a shower, or bodily needs such as hunger or needing to use the toilet);""
Its getting harder and harder. Even making to go to social services to get extra money is something I avoid for months but its good for me. Im gonna get money....but naah. Simple things like going to dentist, even personal heigine, cleaning clothes....i rather get in that fight of flight mood. I am thinking maybe KBT can help me here hopefully

This is such a heavy for me. In last couple of years I got so many incidents...my whole family died, i dont have close friend or partner, i got rare autoimmune disorder where i have constant pain in my legs and nerve ends causing paraparesis. 

My whole life was rough from chidlhood...and im already overxplaining myself. I just wanted to say i was abused to listen orders from some maniacs, doing chores for them like i was employed with them. If i didnt listen, ive gotten beaten up. Its a long story really but this traumatic event was something i always thought its root of my problems. I just cannot clash with any authority. 

My dream was to work in some intellectual field and become school teacher, profesor. I think i would be good at it, but im afraid im too old. 

Honnestly my sensory sensibility and this trauma (and coming from broken home) just can make me to be broken down by any tipe of demands. 

Somehow, after all this years, i survived without the job (actually a had a lot of jobs for a month or two). And just the fact it is needed for me to be there feels like i want to just ran away from job as far as possible? 


I hope you wont judge me, im living with this guilt my whole life. But i finally know whats stopping me. And i want to know what are your advices, tips, everything. 

My life is like 139 euros because of paraparesis and i got help from some humanitarian associations. Im going to therapist, needs money, but it helps me a lot. I would rather not eat because i know how much this means to me (therapist is also on the spectre and im lucky to have her, she understands that i dont think like normal people. 

My ENOrmous question, if there are people like me, how do they live? How they met ends meet? Do they use some kind of specific therapies (from KBT to TA) 
Any resource would be much oblidged. I wish i was workaholic and fix my depression and anxiety with that, than other way around. 


Im not gonna lie, its much HARDER than in my 20s, much harder. Like a person who was in rhe battlefield and they are running out of secure boundaries. 

Ok, tldr; this is long, but please guys read it. Im crappy to make short summary. Important thing is how do people with limited budget help themselves to function with PDA and I need any tips and tricks.
I can live in a cave somewhere, but its not option for me. 


P. S. 
I always thought that people who are homeless and unemployed have some really serious mental issues. You cannot just go: give them money or even tech them fishing. I think for those guys needs years and years of work to get normal, from their chidlhood building up.

I am the kind of guy who most people say im doomed, i am seed gone wrong because of sick terrain. But when i see on some humanitarian oages when kids are in question there is a whole team, support, from whole society, not giving on that kid. Seems jelaous because i am. I hope that doesnt make me a bad person.

Once youre stop being a kid youre doomed and unfixable. Well there is couple of suicide attempts behind me, still alive and i want to make it worth it. I want to make it worth for that kid inside of me to whom i feel so much debt. ";;;;
2025-10-30 11:51:34;I’m genuinely sad;"
Honestly, I think I’ve just experienced the truest sadness I’ve ever felt in my life. My heart dropped about 2cm down? Water instantly squirted out of my eyes, and it stung. And it’s because I’ve developed a really good friendship with a girl I met at my previous job- and long story short we both quit that job in support of each other, and I got her a job at my new job (I started 3 weeks before her). Told me today that I made people at work uncomfortable. She said that I have been making comments that aren’t professional and that I overshare way too much. And that people have been making faces or showing discomfort. And I swear to you- it shook my core. Because this is the most successful and was filled with lots of self love I’ve ever been. Not to mention I got my official diagnosis last week. My pride- it spilled on the floor. I had the horrible realization that is VERY possible. I was so blinded by idk what, that I forgot to sort of mask as of recently. I started to let myself stim, use fidgets, be vocal and I have been doing better for myself and happier but by being me- it caused me harm. I instantly knew that tomorrow I have to come in this ego I’ve been before. And observe- and blend in. A gray version of me. That shade of color always made me feel sad. ";;;;
2025-10-30 10:30:15;Trying to Communicate With My Boyfriend;"I know learning how to communicate is a lifetime thing, and the farther along in life you get better. But I have been questioning my own sanity for a bit and wondering if 

This mostly is between my boyfriend and I. He has bipolar/BPD, and I have ADHD/maybe ASD. As much as we are both neurodivergent, we are just in different classes, so our perception in real time can get pretty different.

There has been moments where we talk and when I say something he seems to always think that I talk like I'm a smartass and I know everything.

He was telling me about his experience about his new job, and how it was the first time he's worked at a place where people talk opening and often about the union (he works in food.) I grew up with a dad working in automobile manufacturing and a lot of them are unionized! I have also briefly worked there too growing up. 

Me ""oh that's good! That means the union you have has a lot of power."" 
Him ""I know that you grew up with your dad in the union and all... I have never experienced it before. You sound like you know everything!""

Me thrown off and confused ""..."" so I shut up. Him ""sometimes I don't like talking to you because you seem like you know everything. I get it, ya grew up familiar with this stuff.""

This is one of many, I'm just noticing it more now? I have known him for almost 7 years... I can't tell if he had a brief split, or I am too much of a dumbass and too direct in talking that I come off as an ass? I grew up being told that I can come off as too harsh, cold, straight to the point from my family... (Which is why I feel like I might be on the spectrum as well? I got diagnosed at 29.) 

I hope this makes sense? Help to break this down 😅

2025-10-30 08:07:57;Are there any successful people on here with adhd?;"I’m suspecting inattentive adhd in myself. For context on why I probably have it, my mom is diagnosed with moderate-severe combined adhd, both of my psychiatrists suspecting adhd in me independently, and I have symptoms that meet the DSM 5 criteria my whole life. 

I’m not trying to invalidate anyone, but has anyone been able to be productive in life with coping mechanisms? Especially without adderall, like working out & coffee helps me a ton to focus. 

My mom says it’s a superpower for her a lot. I don’t want to be doomed to not ever going anywhere in life due to this disorder, and thankfully I have my own coping mechanisms that are already helping me focus and function better in life. ";;;;
2025-10-30 08:03:27;Having doubts about diagnosis - am I just lazy?;"Hi!  
I'm Brazilian, 31 years old. I first suspected autism 8 years ago after taking a silly Facebook test and diving into the ""autistic world"" to try to understand how they are. I identified with it and started therapy, which I still do today.

After a few months, I stopped digging into the ""am I autistic?"" thing because my therapist said I would have suffered a lot more if I were autistic. I have a pretty normal life, friends, and family. I love them and make the effort to see them (family almost every week, friends a few times a year), but I always prefer to stay home and alone. I love being alone — every day — and I'm not depressed.

I like games, work as an institutional trader from home, didn't finish college because I simply don't do what I don't like (lazy?), except work — well, I need to pay bills and try to get rich so I never have to work again, which is my dream. I also hate relying on other people.

People see me as sympathetic, maybe a little shy, but as an adult I stopped being ""weird"". I had friends in school and college, went to a lot of parties. Still have friends today, spend the day on calls with work buddies.

Recently, after some issues in my relationship, my therapist recommended I see a specialist to check if I have something. After 8 sessions and about 20 tests, she said I'm ASD + ADHD. My focus during the diagnosis period was searching the internet to understand if I'm really autistic. Now I got the confirmation and I can't stop thinking that it's not that hard for me — maybe I'm just lazy and selfish, even though I do make the effort to see the people I love. I get annoyed if I don't get alone time — is that ""burnout""? I'm always tired and don't want to go out — why is that ASD and not just laziness?

Anyway, I spent a lot of time talking to AIs over the last couple of months to try to figure out what I am (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok). All of them confirmed it before the diagnosis (when I was sure too), and now they're telling me I'm having impostor syndrome and that it's pretty normal.

This is my first contact with the Asperger/autistic community. I'm posting this to share my experience with people who might actually understand me — instead of just saying ""oh, but it's not a big deal! you're normal!"" — and also to ask your opinion on my thoughts and if you've ever had this experience. Is impostor syndrome really that normal?";;;;
2025-10-30 07:44:47;my story as neurodivergent;"So... I'm Natan, for those who don't know me, I'm 17 years old and in 2022 I myself suspected autism, I already had characteristics of depression at the time and anxiety attacks. Until then I took the test in a not very reliable place and it was negative and I accepted but then I went to the psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar in the depressive stage and anxiety disorder. I never really identified with the disorder but I immediately accepted it. The psychiatrist sent me for a neuropsychological test that assessed everything. My teacher always said he suspected HA in me, but I never self-diagnosed myself. it validated my social anxiety, which at this point I thought was part of my BP. Later on I discovered that I had a trauma because I have unintentional age regressions and so I discovered a possible PTSD which would explain some things. but this new psychologist that I'm seeing observed characteristics of ASD in me now I don't know what to do I was nervous and unstructured I see the characteristics of ASD in me but due to the trauma I don't remember my childhood, my father says one thing my mother another. What would you do in my conditions? I never diagnosed myself, but I tried to evaluate myself, you know? some of my characteristics: I liked playing with other children 
I had hyperfocus but I didn't get angry when people interrupted me
made eye contact
When I was very little I liked hugs but then I stopped liking them. 
Did you participate in group activities? meh in high school no 
facial expressions? I don't know
I had sensitivity but it was selective and only later did it become stronger 
uncomfortable in social settings
did not show joy when seeing people he knew (only parents and grandparents) 
certain food selectivity 
difficulty understanding jokes 
Difficulty expressing feelings? middle ground
empathy? more or less
I asked questions about what was happening around me
attachment to objects
I liked organizing games
change. socialization at school and hyperfocus
crying season with 5 to 8
swing your legs 70%
difficulty initiating conversations
difficulty in social norms
sense of justice

2025-10-30 07:07:37;The College chopping block- tell me how to not go insane!;"I’ve never been more terrified in my life. I’ll hear these stories about college and think that my futures gonna end extremely early at this rate.

First though I’d like to state that I am not diagnosed autistic and also not in college (yet…2-3 years) But with the experiences that I have gone through and the multiple times I’ve been bombarded with the question “Are you autistic?” I thought this subreddit might be my only hope.

To give you another frame of reference, last year I went through multiple depressive episodes, meltdowns, and attempts. I cried and stressed SO hard that I was left paralyzed for nearly 1-2 hours. It was so bad that I almost got sent to a mental hospital all because of ONE classes assignments. That class was honors English II, you can see how absolutely fried I am if a barely not near AP class can do that to me…

IM STILL AFFLICTED WITH THE BURNOUT IT CAUSED TO THIS DAY!!!

For all of the college and post grad students here. Please consider writing about your experiences here! As well as answering atleast one of my questions (I’m am very appreciative of any feedback).

1. How did you take notes in a timely manner during class or any lectures; furthermore make them studyable? 

I’m extremely slow at writing notes and trying to paraphrase them in the moment. It usually ends up looking like gibberish.

2. How do you deal with multiple due dates?

I’ve never been the best when it comes to remembering due dates, theirs been a few times where I didn’t know whether or not to turn something in.

3. How do you DEAL with roommates and dorm rooms in general!!

I’m barely comfortable in my own skin let alone a room with some other person in it. The one time I did sleep in a dorm room for a week WITH FRIENDS; I was a walking husk the entire time. Basically I blanked out for most of it because of how uncomfortable and stressful it was AND THATS WITHOUT SCHOOL WORK. The entire time I’d clean up but my friends would just dirty the place again. I cannot begin to image myself as a full time college student in that situation.

4. Time on Tests and quizzes.

This is the part when I’m told to get extra time by attempting to ask but I’m never given it. Then it goes to “Well maybe you should get diagnosed first?” When I can’t because my parents refuse to.


5. TW: Harmful Behaviors

To be as vague as possible, what exactly would you do if your highly prone to self injury or thoughts relating to it. I’m not fully sure how to explain what I’m trying to ask but basically what do you do to avoid it. Especially if trigged by stress caused easily. (Cuz college)

6. Are your questions answered by professors and do you have the ability to get tutors?

I ask around 6-10 questions throughout any class because of how easily I get confused. Teachers usually get sick of it but it’s one of the only ways I’m able to learn something.

Those were most of my questions but if there are any tips or tricks that y’all would like to tell me, please do.
I’m a hard working student with a 4.25GPA and very much want to continue down that path!!!

2025-10-30 06:18:17;"""It's just ADHD!"" – but it feels completely wrong...";"Hey everyone! 🦄

I'm stuck in a diagnostic limbo and need a reality check. I've had two extensive diagnoses.

1. University Clinic: *""ADHD with autistic traits"" (BAP)* (they themselves stated they are conservative with ASS diagnoses.
2. Specialist: *""Definitely no Autism,"" just ""ADHD.""* – The second diagnostician agreed I have all the traits, but said (quote): ""The overlap between ADHD and autism is gigantic. That's why it's nonsense to assign 'autistic traits' at all.""
3. **Edit:** About 5 years ago: Tested for ADHD at a clinic. Result: ""No ADHD.""

This feels completely wrong. For the past year, I've been researching Autism full-time (which I now realize is a massive special interest). The ""ADHD-only"" diagnosis fails to explain my biggest, life-defining challenges:

* Childhood: I used to line up my toys perfectly and would immediately leave the sandbox if another child approached.
* Eye Contact: I struggle intensely with eye contact; it feels physically painful and breaks my concentration.
* Social Burnout: I cannot sleep after social interaction. My sleep medication literally stops working.
* Routines: I'm not chaotic. I'm hyper-organized and depend on rigid routines to prevent a shutdown.
* My social issues aren't just impulsivity. It's a fundamental, logical *misunderstanding* of social pragmatics (I don't get small talk, ""how are you?"", or non-logical social rituals).
* Sensory Issues: I've had severe sensory issues since childhood (noise, textures …).
* I've been on Vyvanse for months and get very little benefit from it.!
* …

My former therapist (who I had for many years) describes me as ""gifted"" (his assessment, not mine). My screener scores are all screaming Autism.

* AQ: 40 | RAADS-R: 184 | EQ: 11 | CAT-Q: 120 (severe masking) and so on (I did nearly every test in the past twelve months 🙈). But:
* ADOS-2, Module 4: 3 points (non-diagnostic).

I feel like my masking (the 120 on the CAT-Q!), my non-monotone voice, and my expressive facial expressions and gestures (all driven by my ADHD side?) are being used as proof against Autism. It's probably the classic 'female phenotype' diagnostic trap, even though I'm a man in my 40s.

Is this a common experience? To be denied the ASS part of AuDHD because your masking is too good and your ADOS score is low?

Thank you all in advance ♥️";;;;
2025-10-30 04:21:34;Diagnosis at 26, don’t know where to start.;Hi there. Just started coming on Reddit looking for support. I just received a diagnosis of Autism level 2 this week. I’ve been diagnosed with a multitude of mental health disorders since I was a kid, and it wasn’t even thought of until this year. I went to a new therapist and she referred me for an evaluation. I just don’t know what to do now that I have the diagnosis. Any general advice for a situation like this? I don’t even know what to think because my whole life I walked around just suffering through things and beating myself up for not being like everyone else.;;;;
2025-10-30 01:33:36;Unmasking in relationship after diagnosis;"I was diagnosed at age 35 earlier this year, and had been in a relationship about 6 years at this point. My diagnosis has helped me make sense of so many things in my life, and I’m starting the process of unmasking after realizing I have been very heavily masked throughout pretty much my whole life. While I certainly feel like my partner knows who I am at the core of my being, I’ve been hiding and shoving down a lot of things that bother me or that I think might be too much or unpalatable. I’ve been trying to unmask more because I feel like I don’t know who I am fully as a person because I’ve spent my life catering who I am to fit what I think the people around me want me to be. I’m trying to let myself act more like how I instinctually want to be, but some of these things can cause issues in my relationship. I’m hyper verbal so when I’m working on a project or planning something or anything that I’m really excited about I want to talk about it a lot, and this can really annoy my partner. Some of the sensory issues I’ve opened up about in our sex life have made him feel unsure of himself and insecure so I’m worried this is messing with our relationship, too. I’ve also pushed myself to have sex more regularly than I would have of my own volition because I know how important it is to him and us feeling close. I don’t know if things I want to ask for or talk about are reasonable concerns or if they’re just differences I need to learn to accept. Relationships are about compromise, but having never spoken up about things before or even being in touch with my own needs or self expressions, I don’t know where the line is between accommodating your partner in a healthy way, and changing who you are or denying parts of yourself to suite who your partner wants you to be. I’m struggling a lot with trying to unmask and find myself while balancing being part of a relationship.

Does anyone else struggle with this or have any thoughts to share about your own unmasking journey in your relationship?";;;;

Autistic middle child adopted away from siblings grows up frustrated with humanity, declared a public menace, diagnosed with Asperger's, standard IQ tests only went up to 160 and they needed to take an advanced test at a facility after I aced it in a quarter the timeframe given, parents split up, college education, biological siblings found, birth mother is found and is a disappointment, so many family deaths, siblings estranged again, hereditary chronic diseases unlocked, custody battle lost, lose ability to work, after the family home is swindled away for a fraction of it's value to pay for family medical bills related to adopted mothers botched heart transplant I wind up with a small cash inheritance, down to 2/5 parents and 0/9 grandparents, still can't afford a down payment for literally any plot of land, on permanent disability, recently learned I have a profitable talent for blackjack...


Current story;
I've decided to use my analytical skills to gamble all my money on the stock market, I've always been good at predicting volatile market fluctuations, my account was approved just in time today as a have a feeling about today's announcements of last quarter profits for a certain company in four and a half hours...


Future story; 
I'll update tonight or tomorrow, wish me luck! I'm hoping for some tangible validation of my brainpower, so... FOR GOLD AND GLORY! 


Updates; Oct30 8:30; the bank wouldn't let me use my new trading account to do any trades until it was at least a day old. A real shame as my target went up eight percent last night and another eight percent the day before when I was waiting for the account to be approved. The profit reports I was awaiting showed a few billion overshoot from the magic number like I expected, still money to be made but missed profit oh well. While writing this update it went up another dollar lol able to buy any minute now... Well, not literally any minute now, I want to wait until 10:35 after the morning dip settles.

Oct 30 10:50 Can't use the same old plan anymore though, I was super confident but I can't let being held back hold me back! Got the old plan from watching trade reports of US Senators, cross-referencing historical trends, noticing heavy investing into companies that plan to rely on AI, finding news of ambitious projects with proper funding then deep diving to calculate their last quarter profits before they can announce them. I still think it'll go up another %15 but it's likely to take a week or two assuming it doesn't go down for a few days first like it does every year after this report comes out... After seeing the results I may find myself interested in a certain tanking company that may rebound... After a bit of abusing patterns for profit will I be able to quit? Will I fail and lose bragging rights and more? Will any of the sudden surprise audience guess my stock choices? Will I survive stray bears long enough to post an update tomorrow? Only time will tell!

Oct 31 19:45 Power outage most of the day so no Internet out here in the woods, if you die in Canada you die in real life, found my targets haven't moved much since being able to use trading so I'll just be patient. The real lesson so far: know that it may take three days or so to get set up if you haven't traded before. The process may have gone quicker if I used a different service but I don't trust easily and the bank already had my social number and other info.

Hey all. I'm 25nb, undiagnosed but strongly suspected to be on the spectrum by myself, all my close family and friends, and several mental health professionals. I am hoping to pursue a professional evaluation.

I've been diagnosed with severe depression since I was 19. And now I'm questioning all of it. I recently got off meds for the first time since 2019... and I actually feel alive. I assumed that feeling numb and empty all the time was just part of my depression, but now I think it might have been the meds that caused me to feel that way, especially since they're known to commonly cause ""emotional blunting"".

My depression is considered treatment resistant because nothing seems to touch it. Years of therapy, countless different meds, alternative treatments like ECT, TMS, and ketamine... and no improvement in my symptoms (but some improvement in coping skills).

I know this might sound crazy but I'm starting to wonder how much of it is actually MDD (depression) and how much of it is consequences of autism. For the longest time, I could never figure out why my depression seemed to randomly get way worse at times. Now I'm wondering if those episodes are really just autistic burnout. I'm starting to realize that what I've called ""panic attacks"" are likely better described as autistic meltdowns. 

I've never had ""classic"" depression symptoms like severe rumination and feeling like I'm unlovable or a failure, etc. My symptoms have been more like fatigue, anhedonia, numbness, and hopelessness. When things escalate, my symptoms include extreme feelings of unbearable distress and SI. 

So, I'm wondering if the bulk of these symptoms could actually be explained by side effects of meds + autistic burnout. That would certainly explain why nothing has ""worked""!

Anyways, here's the main question: what relationship are known to exist between autism in adults and common expressions of depression? Is misdiagnosis common? If you know of any resources where I could read more about this sort of thing, I'd love to see them.

Thanks for reading and take care";;;;
2025-10-29 23:50:48;How do I explain to friends the fact that me not liking hugs is not their concern?;"Hi! A little heads up. All people involved are in their very early 20s and neurodivergent in some ways, officially diagnosed, me included.

Having said that, I'm not a hug person. I don't like being touched or having my personal space being invaded. It makes me feel suffocated, uncomfortable and in some cases even unsafe. While it is also the result of some traumatic experiences, which is not something I'm willing to share to the friends I'm about to talk about, it is also part of who I am as a person. 

There is this group of friends I've been hanging out with for a bit over a year.
Especially one of them is very insistent on randomly hugging and tickling me. They do seem to have a need to be touchy. I do understand it's their way to show affection and feel comforted. This is a behavior they also have with the others in the group, but while the others either only hug me as a greeting and a goodbye, which is totally fine, this other one keeps doing so when they feel like it.
Not only I've physically shown my distress by being stiff and looking away as they hugged me, something they themselves audibly took notice of, so they are aware. I've also explicitly said I don't like it.

While discussing it, they all seem to be of the opinion that since they and their families and friends are all fine with it, it's unreasonable of me to feel differently. Even going all the way to ask me if I let my parents hug me (a serious question, not teasing) or what will I do when I get a boyfriend and he's going to dislike my behaviour (I'm not a violent person or a believer but god knows I wanted to genuinely punch them at that point...also bold of you to assume I'm straight but whatever).

The last time we all saw each other I've resorted to threaths, saying how if they don't stop it, I'm not going to go out with them anymore. Which did made them sad. But I'm wondering if there's a better way to do it.

In literally any other situation, they're really fun company and it's nice to go out to eat something together to just chill and talk. They showed and said they also enjoy having me around and have helped me immensely in other ways. It's thanks to them if I got access to the process of getting a diagnosis in the first place. I hope it's clear I'm not trying to portray them badly and I myself have said some hurtful things in the past. I'm far from the perfect friend. But, I always respect it and stop when they tell me I need to chill or I simply notice their discomfort. I do also often act as a ""mediator"" when they argue so there's that.

From how they behave even with each other, it's clear they have a problem with respecting each other needs and issues. All in the name of ""trying to help"". So at least it's not just a me ""thing"". I think they see my feelings as a ""concern"" that needs to be fixed...which is pretty awful to be honest, but I can see their good intention.

I've already decided I'm not going to a trip they are trying to plan together next summer, but I'm wondering if there's a better way to make them understand they are losing a friend without resorting to threaths.
It feels very childish and manipulative which is the exact opposite of the kind of friend I want to be.
But I also want to make sure I'm not invalidating their need of being touchy since it's not necessarily something they can help with, or their good intentions.";;;;
2025-10-29 22:22:28;For people who struggled with school in their childhood (both in a school environment and home tutoring), how did you get past that stage of your life?;"For a bit of context, I'm not the neurodivergent (I do have very mild, undiagnosed hints of neurodivergence, though nothing that is detrimental to my life), but I am a family member to someone who is, and it's slightly more severe than most neurodivergent people you'll meet. I'll call them ""D"". D is diagnosed with Asperger's, ADHD and a couple other things that place him into high functioning autism. I do not understand much of his mindset but the school system seems to understand him even less with countless times they have attempted to punish him for bad behaviour only to instigate worse behaviour instead. He's travelled from school to school, been homeschooled a couple of times (and currently is being homeschooled now) and when we moved house, the local council have failed to properly offer any decent support for him for the past 4-5 years. His lessons are often boring, unengaging and almost patronising, leading him to get stressed out, angry and wanting to not do the work, which the education system then puts him onto a lower difficulty course which is even more boring, patronising and lacking in engagement. D is not unintelligent. Quite the opposite, actually. Were he not autistic then I would say he would be far smarter than I. However his lack of willingness to engage with the work provided has sent him down a spiral of doing increasingly easier work that he doesn't want to do, essentially doing work for 12-13 year olds when he is 18.

D wants to be a games developer, however he does not have any resources to start. Because the education system cannot work to his needs, he cannot obtain the grades to go to college (the current course he is on, would he have actually done the exam rather than running up to his room, would not have given him a standard passing grade even if he got everything right), nor will the education system give him a computer science course because he is supposedly on this foundation level. He has tried unity's beginner tutorials but found them boring and unengaging, which I understand.

So D is in this endless spiral. He rarely leaves the house if ever, he spends most of his time up in his room on his computer (and when not he's in the living room playing racing games), he struggles to engage with the work provided which stresses him out and because of this the council bump down the level of his schoolwork because he can''t engage, which does not change anything.

If there is anyone similar to D, who eventually got past these struggles and grew up (because D is certainly not a super serious case where he is unable to be social, mature or understanding. While those moments are rare, they are still possible. D has managed to join my online friend group once or twice, trying to break past his social anxiety. He understands his mistakes, knows he is neurodivergent and has made great progress in his maturity over the past couple years, going from barely contained anger with a desire to break something every time something goes wrong to just getting frustrated when something goes continuously wrong over and over. We have many smashed 2DSes in a cardboard box that we can proudly say he doesn't smash anymore), how did you manage to move on with this situation, and what advice would you give to my family and I so we could better help D get through this particularly difficult whirlpool he's stuck in?";;;;

2025-10-29 21:44:25;Advice: Surviving the workplace?;"Hi, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this but I felt this was the closest subreddit i could ask, if there is a better subreddit to ask this in please redirect me.

For some background, I (21f) am diagnosed with dyslexia and dyscalculia, i'm not diagnosed with either but heavily suspected to have ADHD and some form of social anxiety by several psychologists i've had throughout my life. 

I'm expected to start putting out resumes for an internship soon, and while I do like working in my field (web, mobile, software development, i love programming so much its fun) and my past employers have been impressed in my work, interviews and being expected to be in a social working enviorment is daunting for me. 

I can't focus on conversations or god forbid meetings, try as i might i keep mentally phasing out whenever i'm not doing something with my hands. I've cried during most of my interviews. People treat me off because of how I act and it feels so ackward trying to figure how to talk to them like I'm clunking words together to see if thats how conversations work. Unintentionally being disorganized with memory issues doesn't help either.

Please by god how do some of you survive, I barely was able to survive my last job until they realized I worked better when they just shoved me in a corner and let me do my thing. But i'm scared my next company won't be as understanding, my lecturer commented on how my high GPA and varied skillset will make them expect more from me.

Thank you for your time :)

2025-10-29 20:37:40;Feeling weird when neurotypicals say “we’re all kind of on the spectrum”;"
Hi everyone,

I’m 21 and have been diagnosed with Asperger’s since I was very young. Over the years, I’ve had many conversations with neurotypical people where they’ve said things like “we’re all a little on the spectrum” or “everyone has some traits.”

Honestly, hearing this has sometimes made me feel a bit uncomfortable or even weird. It’s like my experiences and challenges are being minimized, even if unintentionally.

I’m curious, do any of you feel the same way? How do you react when people say things like this? I’d really like to hear your perspective.

2025-10-29 18:17:05;Recently diagnosed, would love some insights;"Hey there,
So the title might be a bit confusing but I'll explain:
I've been diagnosed with ADHD at age 30, which is apparently quite common for a woman (to receive a late diagnosis). According to my psychiatrist it's a very common thing for people who were known as ""gifted children"" or have an IQ higher than the average person because they are able to mask more efficiently.

I've been struggling a lot with imposter sydrom until I got some medication and since it worked well on me I took that as a kind of proof for the diagnosis actually being right.
Since then I've been hyperfocusing on psychoeducation and learned a lot, for example how it's actually less common to only have one type of neurodivergence. I also listen to a great podcast by a neuropsychologist and a clinical psychologist who have multiple episodes explaining different NDs with guests sharing their experiences.

I've been wondering now, how do I know what is normal for my ADHD and what might be a sign that there's something else? There are many aspects that I feel might point to AuDHD, but I'm scared to discuss them with my doctor cause I don't know if it's ""enough"" to go on. Maybe it's my imposter syndrome again? It's just so mind blowing taking the meds and realising that's what neurotically people feel all day long and now I'm questioning it all I guess.

So if there's someone out there sharing their thoughts or maybe even experience on this process I would be super grateful since I feel a little lost and overwhelmed now with all my feelings and thoughts.

Thank you so much guys!";;;;

I often feel random tingling, itching or short localized pains somewhere in my body (think a loose hair, dry skin or an allergy prick test). It's always mild and there's no pattern to it. It's really frustrating as I can't tune it out.

2025-10-29 17:27:09;Meltdown(s) so bad I got fever;"Hi, as the title says, I'm having issues with meltdown(s) so violent that I've been having some low fever (talking like, between 37.5 and 38 C) (around 100 F for the fellow Americans).

I'm 27, I was diagnosed with learning disabilities, ADHD, and Autism a couple of years ago, after I went into autistic burnout after finishing my bachelor's, and I started seeking professional help. 

I recently moved to a new city for my master's, and I'm having a LOT of issues adjusting to the environment and everything. I'm constantly overstimulated, and I'm having a lot of meltdowns/shutdowns. A couple of days ago, I had a meltdown so bad that it actually made me spike a fever, and I've spent the last two days in bed sleeping and having fever-induced nightmares.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Did you find something that helped?

2025-10-29 11:49:37;"I hate being ""unlucky""";"I’m a 16-year-old boy who feels kind of unlucky. By “unlucky,” I mean that I struggle with many things that seem easy for other people, and I don’t have a formal diagnosis yet because I can’t afford one. It doesn’t matter if I’m neurodivergent or not—what matters is that I often feel less “normal” than I think I should be. I have difficulties with social interactions, managing stress, and many other things that make daily life harder for me. Sometimes it feels like no matter how much I try, I can’t fully keep up with the way other people handle situations.

On top of that, I’m LGBT (bi), which sometimes makes life even more complicated. Being different in multiple ways can feel isolating, especially when society has so many expectations of what is “normal” or “acceptable.” Sometimes I just wish I could be “normal”—to manage stress without constant effort, to be less impulsive, to have emotional intelligence, to be more perfectionist, or simply to navigate life more smoothly.

Being “normal” seems so much easier. Like not crying when someone speaks loudly, enjoying sports, understanding social rules effortlessly, or fitting in without constantly questioning yourself. It feels like being “normal” would mean having a life that flows naturally, instead of feeling constantly out of place or behind. Sometimes I dream about what it would be like to be someone else, someone who doesn’t struggle with these things every day. But at the same time, I know I’m learning to deal with my challenges and to find my own way, even if it’s not the “normal” path.

2025-10-29 09:04:41;After my late autism diagnosis, I finally understand the song I wrote about myself.;"Hi everyone 💜,  
I wanted to share something personal with this community that has meant so much to me.

Before my recent formal autism diagnosis, I made this video as a form of creative expression. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was one of the first times I was truly letting my unmasked self speak. The song came from a place of confusion, exhaustion, and a deep need for self-understanding — and now that I’ve been diagnosed as autistic (high masking), it feels like I can finally see what I was trying to tell myself through the lyrics.

Since reading *Unmasking Autism* by Dr. Devon Price, I’ve begun to have more compassion for myself, the version of me who was always trying to “fit,” to keep up, to hold it together.

I made this video as Esme Reelle, my creative self, and I’d like to dedicate it to anyone here who has ever felt lost, misunderstood, or like they were “missing the start” of the puzzle.  
Thank you all for being part of a space where authenticity and difference are celebrated. 💙

**Lyrics:**

Hey, hey, it’s me, I’m tryin’ not to fall apart,  
Life’s like a puzzle, but I’m missing the start.  
Used to teach French, then I coded all night,  
Now I’m on pause — feels weird but kinda right.

Don’t touch me, I’m scared, but I’m still here,  
Trying to find my way through the fog and the fear.  
I’m walking, I’m breathing, one step at a time,  
And somehow, some way, I’ll be alright.

*UC* yeah, you’re kind of a jerk,  
Trying to slow me down, but I’m still at work.  
Moving around like a confused GPS,  
Where’s next? No clue, but I’ll do my best.

He’s got his grind, I’ve got my slow days,  
We worry ‘bout the world in a million ways.  
But at least we got each other — that’s kinda neat,  
Even if sometimes I feel like I’m beat.

Don’t touch me, I’m scared, but I’m still here,  
Trying to find my way through the fog and the fear.  
I’m walking, I’m breathing, one step at a time,  
And somehow, some way, I’ll be alright.

He’s out there hustlin’, he’s so strong,  
And **Boo’s** lickin’ my face like “why you so wrong?”  
Board games on the table, but I can’t find the dice,  
Movies paused on sad scenes, gotta press play twice.

So here’s to the mess and the awkward and all,  
The times I wanna scream or just wanna crawl.  
I’m scared but I’m strong, weird and alive,  
And somehow, somehow, I will survive.

Don’t touch me, I’m scared, but I’m still here,  
Trying to find my way through the fog and the fear.  
I’m walking, I’m breathing, one step at a time,  
And somehow, some way, I’ll be alright.

*Ulcerative Colitis*  
**Boo = cat**

Thank you for letting me share this piece of my story. 💜  
If you’ve ever created something before knowing you were autistic — and later realized it was your inner voice speaking — I’d love to hear about it too.";;;;
2025-10-29 06:08:42;I make people anxious and they say they can't stand it (or me);"I was recently diagnosed with autism, level 1, at the age of 40, in my city Milan Italy. While not knowing anything about my condition - despite I always felt something was odd - I completed my studies while working, then opened my own company, made a living with my job (filming and motion design) while also having a career on the side as a music artist. Despite all this, people I love keep blaming me for being irresponsible, chaotic, unpredictable. They feel uneasy and worried around me, like something bad could happen at any moment. They cry and yell and shake and say they can't take it. It is painful to know. According to their words, having to do with me is hard, and scary. I feel like my sole presence is enough to make them feel lost or in danger.
I validate their feelings, knowing that what they feel is real, but I am a big fan of facts, since I value what is just and true, and I try my best to evaluate reality for what it is. When I do, I see that they are anxious around me BUT i see no real reason for them to feel that way: I always made it on my own and I don't come from a rich family. Never failed at school. Never had debts. Never skipped a single month of rent. Never got in a physical fight as an adult. Never stole, never screwed anybody. Never been in jail. Even telling a white lie is a problem to me. Yes I do have random schedules but I was never late with a work delivery. Yes I do get in solitary tunnels of hyperfocus but when I emerge the work is there, and it gets praised for being good, and often better than expected. Never dumped a production. Never caused a financial damage. Yes I tend to isolate and I'm terrible at answering my phone, but I make contact back as soon as I realise the calls and messages I missed. When I direct and produce, I put crazy effort in making sheets and tables to give everyone clear information, using technical language. The shooting days are tight but never go overtime, all the time slots plays as planned, logistic is anticipated and taken care of, so that there is proper mind space for creative decisions.
In my free time, I use recreational drugs but I never had an addiction. I party and stay up late but I do show up the morning after. I don't have a routine and I struggle with other people's way of dealing with time and space but I try my best to fit their needs, which I find overkill since my deliverables are always there. Why should I take part in the recital of the good soldier boy? Even if my hair looks messed up, the work is there. The facts are out there, in the world, 
I also mask and attend to their social events. I have long time friends and partners, strong connections, stable and deep interests, a ""normal"" life.
Still, some of my closest people experience anxiety and fear because of me. What is it?

I write because I need a reality check, since I think the world values those people that are apparently dependable more than those that, like me, are apparently a mess but factually dependable and independent. 
Nothing is wrong with needing help or having difficulties or making mistakes; I do have my struggles. Nothing is wrong with the points in the above list: jail or addictions or debts... 
I just do not understand why these people accuse me of being irresponsible when life proves the opposite.
I find these comments unjust and unreasonable, especially giving all the effort I make to keep myself together.

2025-10-29 06:04:45;Is it normal that antidepressants don’t help me at all?;"I’ve been on antidepressants pretty much continuously since 2021.

I started with **Prozac** (don’t remember the dosage), and at some point I just stopped taking it without any withdrawal symptoms, and that was it.

In 2022, when I finally got a diagnosis, I was prescribed valproate + **escitalopram** 20 mg + Seroquel XR 300 mg.  
Seroquel helped me sleep, but it turned me into a total zombie with obesity, so I got off it and kept only escitalopram — 5 mg every 3 days, just to avoid headaches (I tried quitting completely but couldn’t because of the withdrawal headaches).

In 2025, with a new psychotherapist, I switched to **fluvoxamine**, 200 mg.

This whole time I haven’t noticed *any* improvement at all — my sleep issues never changed, and my social anxiety didn’t get any better either.  
After realising again that I wasn’t feeling any progress (even after a couple of months), I started taking 100 mg once every 4 days, again just to avoid the headaches.

But yesterday I took the full 200 mg, and I felt absolutely awful all day — terrible mood and extreme irritability.

Long story short, I’m exhausted by all these medication side effects, and I just want to stop taking anything altogether.

My therapist suggests trying Zoloft next, but I honestly don’t believe anything will change anymore, and I’m starting to think it’s better to quit meds entirely.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Or is it possible that the meds *are* helping but I just don’t notice it?

2. I have this persistent feeling that no one around me likes me, that society doesn't like me and that people have plots against me because they naturally hate me for being autistic.

3. My memory and skills have declined since I have been an adult 

4. I struggle sometimes with forming sentences or conveying my thoughts and emotions. I don't really understand my emotions or things I do or think.

5. I like to steal from the stores

7. I constantly feel like a bad person and that no one will ever like me and that I'm undeserving of being here

8. I used to believe I could talk to God through crystals and sometimes do and write down what I hear. Its not a voice but like words and thoughts coming in to my head.

2025-10-29 04:39:57;being raised catholic as a queer autist fucking sucks;"This is gonna be a long one, but I would appreciate any advice/commiseration y’all can offer. 

I’m 24 and I wasn’t diagnosed as autistic until recently. I was raised very Catholic - going to mass every Sunday, praying as a family, doing all the sacraments, etc. - and I’m still processing how that affected me. 

Some backstory for context. Looking back at my childhood, I showed all the “signs” of autism- sensory issues that resulted in meltdowns over “nothing”, echolalia and other forms of stimming, strong special interests, ongoing social struggles. 

My mother made the decision to pull me out of a private Catholic elementary school to homeschool me when I was 10, a choice I think was motivated by embarrassment and shame, though she told people it was because I was “gifted” academically. 
While she may have been proud of my academic achievements, she was obviously disappointed in me as a person, especially compared to my older NT sister. 

My mom would constantly try to correct my behaviors and make them more socially acceptable - make eye contact, don’t laugh so much, that was a weird thing to say, etc. I remember one time shortly after she pulled me out of school, I was still in Girl Scouts with my “friends,” and I kept trying to say hi to one of them and getting ignored. I looked to my mom for help and saw her crying, watching me struggle. I had never felt so ashamed. 

Over time, I learned to mask, and would mask “extra” around my parents to avoid disappointing or angering them. But during the homeschooling era, this meant masking all the time. It was mostly just me and my mom for four years, with my dad working. Looking back, my mom wasn’t equipped to teach - she had no resources, no connections with other homeschoolers, no experience with teaching, and no patience for when I didn’t understand things fast enough. We were going off of Catholic-approved curricula, all second- or third-hand because we were poor. She’d tell me to read the lesson in the book for each of my subjects and do whatever “homework” it said to do; usually, I was done by noon, with nothing structured for the rest of the day.

I rarely saw kids my age during this time. I realize much of my social dysfunction is just autism, but it’s hard not to credit some of it to the years I spent isolated from my peers. I felt so alone, and that feeling only worsened when I realized I was bisexual at 12. 

At this point, I had already been struggling with obsessive/compulsive tendencies when it came to religion, particularly in the form of “sinful” intrusive thoughts. But coming out to myself made them 10x worse. Based on what my parents had drilled into me, I became fully convinced that when I died, I was going to go to hell forever, and I worried about it all the time. It really fucked me up. I even convinced myself I had killed my aunt, who died in an accident, by sinning; I thought God was punishing her for my sins, which my parents said he would do. 

But what do you call that, exactly? It’s not neglect, it’s not abuse, it’s just me having an awful time in my head because of the way that I am. It’s sleepless nights spent praying to be made different. It’s so much shame that you bawl during every confession. There’s no easy, catch-all word for “my parents provided for me materially, and they tried to the best of their abilities to help me emotionally, but they couldn’t, and also they made me think I was irredeemably evil along the way.”

My siblings (F34 and M15) turned out fine, so realistically, my mom and dad are probably fine parents - it’s just that, as conservative catholics, they were not the parents I needed. Being queer is obviously part of it, but I think the fact that I’m autistic is an even larger part. As a literal thinker, I took what our parents told us at face value - that we have to be good Catholics, otherwise we will go to hell. It seems that I was the only kid who took it so seriously. It feels so unfair that I am the only one of my siblings who has to deal with the repercussions of spending your whole childhood convinced you are a sick, perverted sinner who deserves eternal torture. They just got to be kids.

Throughout high school and college, I kept quiet about my identity and pretty much everything else about me, because it would all lead back to the whole sexuality thing - it shapes my values, my politics, who I’m friends with and who I’m not, the media I enjoy and how I enjoy it (fujos rise up.) So with most topics of conversation off the table, I talked my parents about next to nothing other than things I could impress them with, like good grades and success in extracurriculars. 

It was like the relationship version of quiet quitting - emotionally detaching from them and just doing what you have to do to keep them happy. For years and years, I silently listened to their opinions on what should happen to gay people, trans people, women, immigrants, non-believers. I listened to their conspiracy theories making less and less sense as they were pushed further and further to the right. Cutting them off was a choice I assumed I would eventually have to make. Growing up felt like survival, and I always had it in the back of my mind that I would be “free” once I was out of college. 

Fast forward to now, I’m “free,” but still struggling. A few years ago, after so long stewing, I snapped at my dad after he made a transphobic Facebook post, telling him (with permission of course) that my best friend and husband are both trans (news to my dad at the time). I also said I was done talking to him and my mom until they made some sort of effort to educate themselves about trans people and we could have an actual conversation about it. It has been 2 years and they have done nothing to that end.

I don’t know if I’m justified in cutting my parents off. Like I said, it wasn’t a cut-and-dry case of abuse or neglect, and that makes it hard to explain to people what was so hard about my childhood - my parents included. My decision to cut them off when I did was an angry, impulsive one, and I wish I had thought it through better, in part because I barely scratched the surface with how much they had hurt me.

I’m now considering writing up a longer letter to my parents explaining my feelings, not to twist the knife but to fix my first attempt. I get the sense that this was a bolt from the blue for them, me woke-ly canceling them for expressing different opinions from me on social media (funnily enough, I never really cared about the stupid Facebook post; it was just the straw that broke the camel’s back.) But their “opinions” are that  husband is a woman and we’re both going to burn in hell forever for the sin of being together. That’s not an acceptable belief to have and share about someone you allegedly love. Maybe it’s just that pesky autistic sense of justice getting to me, but I am not OK with that. 

With that in mind, I don’t want to send the wrong message by breaking no contact. I think they deserve more of an explanation, and I think it would be cathartic for me to write it all out, but to be totally honest, I have not missed my parents at all. We had no relationship before this; they knew/know nothing about me. They see me as the mask and get upset whenever I try taking if off around them. Also, objectively, cutting them off has improved my life (autistic pragmatism!) The last two years “without” them have been without a doubt the best two years I’ve ever had. But I do regret the way I cut them off, and I want to reiterate in case I didn’t properly communicate it the first time that I am open to a relationship in the future if they’re willing to try to educate themselves.

Another complicating factor is that having autism really impacted my experience as a child, but I can’t talk to them about that either because they would never believe me. They are raw milk-carnivore-diet types who believe autism is caused by vaccines (which is ironically why I 
wasn’t vaccinated as a child, lol.) I don’t know how I could explain my issues without that piece and all the language that comes along with it.

So I guess my question is - do I send a “followup” letter? If so, how do I do that in a way that they will understand? I also have to figure out what to do about my extended family. Contact with anyone in the family has been very limited since I cut off my parents; I only talk to my brother (15, still living in their house) regularly. I was always the black sheep of the family, and no one ever really talked to me, so it doesn’t make much of a difference day-to-day, but I am thinking of future weddings/funerals/the like. 

I know this is a lot - sorry for the massive text dump. Hoping someone has had a similar experience or advice to share. ";;;;
2025-10-29 04:33:05;Late diagnosed, 1st gen immigrant using AI to cope;"Hi everyone, I was just diagnosed with inattentive AuDHD 2mo ago, and going through what Claude legit described as an “ontological crisis”.

For context, I’m a 31yo Black “third culture kid” and with my upbringing, it’s genuinely hard to know where my mask ends and i begin. I’m the youngest in my family, but also the first to be diagnosed. Given the internalized stigma i grew up with, I’ve been turning to AI to co-regulate via processing and studying. 

Yes, I would much rather do this with loved ones, but the sheer volume of my thoughts makes me want to process before sharing to avoid overwhelm. 

My therapist has flagged the risk of me “splitting” my support channels by using GPT/Claude/Gemini to vent and understand. It’s a valid flag (average +15hrs/week on AI apps), but it’s genuinely been making me feel better as i cognitively process.

Any other heavy users of AI, esp those who use voice to text who’ve been able to successfully unmask more with friends post diagnosis? Thanks!";;;;
2025-10-29 03:37:16;Pain tolerance?;"Hello everyone?

To start I’m (28F) not diagnosed autistic. I’m simply the weird child but my sisters say it goes without question. Like 15 minutes ago I fell going up the stairs directly on the nose and heard a lovely crunch. Started to turn colors right away but didn’t feel a thing. I cried and felt weak in the knees but it didn’t hurt. I’m pretty confident I broke it but it does not hurt at least nothing more than just pressure. Looking back I don’t think I’ve ever gotten hurt after being hit in the nose and some other injuries to the face. I once had a rock imbedded in my cheek for 3 days after falling without any worry, but having water or anything on my face makes me jitter.

Again not diagnosed but my sisters started working at a before school program for autistic kids due to helping me when I was a kid. Now a social worker.

Any way I’m reluctant to go to the doctor because they always dismiss me when I say that I think something is wrong but it doesn’t hurt. Like I’ve had appendicitis, utis, strep and neuropathy, and they just ignore me when I say it doesn’t hurt. So I guess I’m asking is this a common thing? Am I just being weird? Or if someone knows anything about facial bones is it possible that cracking could occur without breaking? I don’t wanna go to the doctor ";;;;
2025-10-29 00:47:09;32, but feel like I have the mind and air of a teenager;"Hi all! I am new to this subreddit! Looking forward to interacting with yall.

I got my diagnosis 2 years ago. While it made sense…. It kind of felt set and stone that people were just never gonna really feel safe for me. I often felt “off” with people. They always commented on how strange or weird I was. Or wouldn’t know how to respond to things or interact with me. And I very rarely found people that made me feel “normal” for lack of a better word.

Now I am mostly friendless with the exception of my spouse who is my best friend. But I otherwise don’t interact with my family much and have a hard time finding solid interactions with others. 

A lot of people see me and read me immediately as a teenager. I have even had 18 year olds think I was their age, but when older folks interact with me they actually treat me like a child before I can fester up the energy to tell them KINDLY that I am 32. But people have talked over me or “on my behalf” to say my mother or a long distance friend in person if that makes sense? 

And especially in healthcare spaces, most of what I say doesn’t seem to be taken as seriously as if it were my spouse. I feel talked down to a lot of times? Of course my inkling is always that it’s just me… but do other fellow autists feel like a lot of people do this? 

I am also not sure if there is a significant difference when it comes to your perceived gender? I am perceived sometimes as a girl, and receive that infantilizing treatment. And when I am perceived as a boy, I feel as though I am kind of seen as defiant or offputting.

Anywho, I hope it isn’t just me 😭

2025-10-29 00:28:06;I need to know if anyone else feels the same way and has overcome this perpetual cycle.;I am nearing 30 and I was diagnosed as autistic in 2022. I don’t want to go on about all of my other diagnoses, but I am very open to share if more context is needed to get better advice. I have had trouble with insomnia and other parasomnias for my entire life. If I don’t take all of my daily medications at just the right time and in just the right way, I won’t sleep. Sometimes that cycle catches and has left me sleepless for days. When I am awake, I am dissociated and derealized chronically. This has also been how I exist from as far back as I can recall. I have nightmares every single night. I have become pretty desensitized to the content of most of them but a lot of them repeat. They are getting worse and I feel like I’m always teetering on the edge of psychosis (I have had episodes of psychosis in the past). When talking to a friend recently, she asked, “So you’ve never woken up feeling rested or refreshed from sleep?”. I realized the answer was no. I have become so exhausted and honestly terrified. I feel like I’m finally breaking down to the point where I am often very depressed and I wake up with racing thoughts making me panic. These thoughts and feelings that come through as I’m coming out of the sleep state into wake state are usually very abstract and very dark and disturbing. I just want to figure out what actions I can take toward getting better. A life spent full of fear is no life. I am losing out on so much because of this. If anyone feels like asking questions to help further this conversation, PLEASE do. I need to discuss this. I am suffering. ;;;;
2025-10-28 21:44:47;Parents of 15 year old - Need Help!!;"Some background first, my son is about to turn 15, he was diagnosed with Asperger's about 3.5 years ago. He is very intelligent and was not diagnosed until later because of that, even though my wife and I pursued a diagnosis because of behavioral issues we noticed from a young age.

The issue I am hoping for some insight on is the gloom cycle and eventual crash that comes at the end. We have tried so many approaches with him, listening, responding, comforting, but it always escalates until he gets more angry and crashes. Recently I have been just stepping away and telling him I can't help him if he is going to argue with me when I try and help. I can see the solution but it is unclear when he is triggered. I have seen enough of these crash cycles to know its going to happen, just from a simple sentence. Usually he will complain about something that seems out of place for the moment, like it is bedtime and he is tired but he complains he needs to figure out when to get something done for school, or that he doesn't have enough time with his cousins to spend together. He will fixate on that concern and even if my wife and I try and suggest options and solutions he will reject them and then get worked up until he gets angry and shouts, waking up his younger siblings and being a huge a\*\*hole to everyone. When it happened every few days it was easier to handle, but its been almost daily for the past two weeks and I just do not have the patience with that short of a recovery period. 

WHAT CAN I DO TO EITHER STOP OR MINIMIZE THE INTENSITY OF THE CYCLE???? I am at my wits end and hate feeling so angry towards my own child for the way he acts out in these cycles. He is usually quite respectful and kind outside of these events, but no matter how early on I recognize the beginning cycle, there is nothing I can seem to do to help except let it run its course in all its overwhelming intensity.";;;;

2025-10-28 19:35:30;Cocaïne effects (medication?);"Yesterday I went for an operation called Colblation. They gave me 200 mg of Cocaïne as a form of anesthesia. I had to let it sit in my nose for atleast 20 minutes deep in my nose before operation.

During this time I felt so different. Like I felt so much more normal. Like the my regular daily struggles with myself have been parked away for a little. The doctor told me that people with adhd/autism react differently to these kinds of stimuli. It was very calming and relaxing.

I have tried to get diagnosed for autism begin this year but they said they couldn't tell for sure due to cptsd. (need to work more on treating cptsd, then retake my daignoses which takes a long time) I likely have autism, not sure about adhd. Could someone fill me in regarding medication like this?

2025-10-28 11:38:39;It's not my Partner, it's her House;"Tl;dr: Moved in with my girlfriend, but the city life is constantly overstimulating me. How can I make this work?

A year ago, I (40M) moved in with my girlfriend (39F) of, at the time, approximately two years. I was diagnosed recently as an adult with autism thanks to my gf's suggestion, and we see a couples' counselor who specializes in neurodivergence to maintain our relationship. At the time, I was living in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. I loved the isolation, the nature, and the animals that were always around even though it was a dump. My girlfriend lives in the city in a home she has a mortgage on. The neighbors are all around, there are very few birds, and we live on a pretty regularly used road with cars frequently driving past. She wanted me to move in with her so she could see me more often. My gf always hated when I would leave to go home each visit. I was hesitant, but I agreed.

The first problem happened the week I was moving in- her son (21M) couldn't pay his rent, and asked to move back in with his girlfriend (22F). They moved back into my gf's basement. The basement was the space I was going to escape to when I was feeling overstimulated. But at this point, I was already committed to the move with my lease ended and already partly moved out. I could not back out. In retrospect, had they moved back in earlier, I would have not moved in.

The past 2-3 months, I have been increasingly irritated all the time. I am more prone to meltdowns. We have had several fights because I don't have enough spoons for my gf. My GF has CPTSD and abandonment issues, and this is highly triggering to her. This past week, we were on the cusp of a breakup. Our therapist asked us to take some time to understand each other's perspectives. 

I had planned a weekend away to self-regulate, and the therapist suggested I take that time. I am there now. It is a beautiful Airbnb in the middle of nowhere with cows and sheep outside my window and no one around. I am having a great time. The time away is making me realize that the house we live in is draining my resources constantly. This place is charging me and letting me regulate, where my gf's house is always draining me in lots of little ways. I think this is why I have been increasingly irritable and not wanting her company as much. I think this is why I'm constantly trying to take time to recharge but never getting anywhere.

I guess I wanna ask- has anyone been able to make a situation like this work? I don't want to give my gf any kind of ultimatum. She eventually wants to move into a more naturey space, but that's a 5 or 10 year plan. It won't happen anytime soon. We've tried planting a tree and putting up a birdfeeder to give me more nature, and that is nice, but I feel like there's nowhere I can go to not be seen in some way and feel comfortable unmasking. I know if I could come up with a solution that worked, my girlfriend would help me. She cares about me very much.

Any advice would be very helpful.";;;;

2025-10-28 09:42:56;On Self-Diagnosis: A Journey Through Three Identities;"Hey folks! I've spent the last decade-plus navigating three communities that have very different relationships with self-diagnosis: transgender, autistic, and dissociative identity disorder (DID) spaces. 

I like community, and I'm grateful to be able to speak easily with others like me in every case. For a while, I thought the differences in how ""welcoming"" these communities are to self-diagnosis said something about the people in them. I wondered if there were some inherent temperament issues, or maybe that some communities were just more exclusionary than others.

I was wrong. The stuff I uncovered about this really helped me understand a lot of the assumptions and judgments I was making, and I want to share. I'm hoping that folks in all three groups can find this helpful. I'll be cross-posting pretty broadly and I'm super interested to see how the reception differs! 💜


My Personal Journey (a bit of context):

I'm transgender. I'm autistic. I have DID. I've got firm clinical diagnoses on the latter two, and I feel strongly that nobody but the individual can “confirm” a trans identity.

I came to these identities in that order over the course of YEARS, and each community taught me something different about how they approach self-diagnosis. 

The trans community taught me that self-knowledge is valid and that I don't need a gatekeeper's permission to know who I am. 

The autistic community reinforced this, teaching me that self-diagnosis can be just as accurate as clinical diagnosis, especially when formal diagnosis is expensive, inaccessible, or comes with serious risks. These communities built my biases and attitudes, and I really value the lessons I have learned about existing on a great big spectrum of valid experience.

When I was diagnosed with DID, I was super uncomfortable with the idea, and I jumped into DID spaces online for support and information. Many DID spaces treat self-diagnosis with a lot of skepticism and sometimes even hostility. Coming from where I was, this felt like needless, mean-spirited gatekeeping. It felt exclusionary. Why were these people being so rigid when the other communities I'd been part of were so accepting? It felt really uncomfortable to me.

Over the past month I've been looking at the actual research on this. It was super clarifying for me.



The Numbers:  

Here's what the research actually shows about self-diagnosis accuracy. In each case I'm discussing INFORMED, ADULT self-assessment.

Transgender identity: 98-99% accuracy. When adults go through the process of gender-affirming medical care, regret rates are around 1%. The Amsterdam cohort study followed nearly 7,000 people over 43 years and found regret rates of 0.6% for trans women and 0.3% for trans men. If somebody says they're transgender, they're transgender - almost always.

Autism: 45-80% accuracy, depending on the context. Self-diagnosed and clinically diagnosed autistic adults look ""remarkably similar"" on validated measures. The accuracy drops when there's significant psychiatric comorbidity, but it's still quite high. While the low end here is 45%, it seems that MOST people who feel that they are autistic are autistic.

DID/OSDD: There's no question that this is the least-studied statistic I can share, but it really shook me. 0-8% confirmation in the limited studies that exist. In one study of 85 people with elevated dissociative symptoms, only 8.2% were confirmed to have DID. In another study, 0 out of 36 self-diagnosed individuals were confirmed upon structured assessment. So, the VAST majority of people who feel that they've got DID absolutely do not!

When someone says ""I'm trans"" and pursues transition, they're right 98-99% of the time. When someone says ""I'm autistic,"" they're right 45-80% of the time. When someone says ""I have DID,"" they're right 0-8% of the time. No fucking WONDER the communities behave differently around the issue!

This was SUCH a huge paradigm shift for me that I'm trying to write it up as clearly as I can and to contextualize it in a meaningful way for my peers. I'm not a science writer, but I'm doing my best.

These studies outline what should have been obvious to me but wasn't - these are completely different phenomena that require completely different community responses.

When the trans community says ""trust people when they tell you who they are,"" we're backed by data showing that people are almost always right. When the autistic community says ""self-diagnosis is valid,"" we're backed by data showing that self-diagnosis is highly accurate, especially given the barriers to formal diagnosis.

But when the DID community approaches self-diagnosis with skepticism, they're responding to a reality where the vast majority of people who self-diagnose don't actually have the condition.



The Nature of the Conditions Themselves:

The accuracy differences reflect something fundamental about these conditions.

Transgender identity is something you live with every day. It's about your internal sense of who you are, and generally, you're the world's leading expert on your own gender. There are edge cases and exceptions (there's a form of OCD that creates intrusive thoughts about gender, for example), but these are relatively rare. Most people who persistently identify as transgender are transgender.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with traits that are relatively observable to the person experiencing them. Social difficulties, sensory issues, pattern recognition, special interests - these are things you can notice about yourself, especially as an adult with the language to describe them. Our moderate accuracy rate reflects genuine self-recognition backed up by lifetimes spent trying to assess why we're “different,” somewhat tempered by the challenge of distinguishing autism from overlapping conditions.

DID, however, is specifically designed by the brain to be hidden. It's a trauma response where the whole point is dissociation - separation and amnesia between parts. The very nature of the disorder means that people with actual DID often don't recognize it. 

Meanwhile, people with other conditions (especially BPD, PTSD, or schizophrenia) might see dramatic media portrayals and identify with surface-level symptoms while missing the core features.


The False Paradox:

I couldn't get past something in these numbers at first. DID folks know that DID is systemically UNDERdiagnosed. Professionals frequently misdiagnose DID. Studies show that 26-40% of DID cases are initially misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. BPD is diagnosed in 30-70% of people with DID. The average DID patient has received multiple prior diagnoses before getting the correct one.

So how can professionals be constantly missing DID while laypeople are constantly over-diagnosing it? It fried my noggin to think about.

I think the issue is directionality. Professionals are diagnosing genuine DID cases as other things (missing many genuine cases), while laypeople are diagnosing other conditions as DID (false positives from visible symptoms). Why?

Because DID is covert by both structure and by function. It involves amnesia, shame, and parts that actively work to hide themselves. Genuine cases often don't recognize themselves or present in obvious ways. I was in my late 40s before I had ANY CLUE about my DID. 

“Not-DID” (other conditions mistaken for DID) is visible. People see the dramatic switching in movies and think ""that's me!"" when what they're actually experiencing is BPD mood instability, PTSD flashbacks, or something else entirely.


Community Responses:

I've gone back through hundreds of discussions in r/DID this week in light of this information, and it suddenly feels a lot different to me. The DID community isn't being exclusionary when they say ""please get assessed by a professional."" They're responding to a situation where:

- The base rate of accurate self-diagnosis is near zero
- The most common differential diagnoses (BPD, PTSD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) all require different treatment approaches
- Misidentification actively harms both the person (who doesn't get correct treatment) and the community (which gets flooded with people who don't genuinely share their experiences)

It's not gatekeeping. It's triage in a situation where self-assessment is genuinely unreliable.

Meanwhile, the trans community isn't being naive when they say ""trust people about their gender."" They're responding to a situation where:

- Self-knowledge is highly accurate
- Gatekeeping has historically been used as a weapon to deny people necessary care
- The risks of false positives (detransition) are vastly outweighed by the harms of false negatives (denying transition to people who need it)


And the autistic community is threading the middle ground, where self-diagnosis is reasonably accurate but professional diagnosis is often prohibitively expensive, carries risks (like loss of parental rights or employment discrimination), or is simply unavailable for adults, especially women and minorities.


We carry biases from our personal history:

To get personal again, I learned about self-diagnosis in the trans community first. That shaped how I thought about self-diagnosis forever after. When I encountered the autistic community's general embrace of self-diagnosis, it reinforced everything I'd learned. By the time I got to DID spaces, I had a strongly held belief that self-diagnosis skepticism was just gatekeeping by insecure people who wanted to feel special.

I was completely wrong.

But I also see the opposite problem. People who start in DID spaces and then encounter trans or autistic communities often bring their learned skepticism with them. They apply the DID model (where self-diagnosis is highly inaccurate and professional assessment is crucial) to contexts where it doesn't fit.

To my eye, both biases cause harm.

If you're in the trans community: The way we think about self-knowledge and identity is valid FOR GENDER. But we need to be careful about applying it universally. Some conditions genuinely require professional assessment, not because of gatekeeping, but because the conditions themselves resist self-identification.

If you're in the autistic community: Our embrace of self-diagnosis is backed by good evidence FOR AUTISM. But we should be cautious about extending it to other conditions without checking whether the accuracy holds. And we should acknowledge that 45-80% accuracy still means some people are wrong, and that's okay to discuss.

If you're in the DID community: The skepticism toward self-diagnosis is appropriate FOR DID. But we need to avoid becoming reflexively skeptical of self-diagnosis in other contexts. The person saying ""I'm autistic"" without a formal diagnosis isn't making the same kind of claim as someone self-diagnosing DID, and they don't deserve the same skepticism.

“I'm Tired, Boss!”:

There's one more thing I want to address, specifically about DID spaces. When I talked about this with my bff, I realized that DID spaces are FUCKING EXHAUSTED. 

When accuracy rates are 0-8%, that means for every one person who actually has DID and finds the community, there are 12-infinity people who don't have DID but think they do. That signal-to-noise ratio is absolutely devastating. People with DID are trying to find others who understand their specific experiences, and they're drowning in a sea of people whose experiences are fundamentally different.

It's not about being exclusionary. It's about maintaining useful spaces to exist in community. It's about being able to have conversations that are actually relevant to your life without constantly explaining ""no, that's not what DID is"" or ""that sounds more like BPD"" or ""have you talked to a professional about this?"" 

I had been interpreting protectiveness as exclusion, when really it was just people trying to maintain spaces where they could actually discuss their lived experiences. I still think fake-claiming does more harm than good, but now I see that persistently and firmly redirecting people who think they might have a dissociative disorder toward OTHER spaces and professional resources is the right thing to do for everyone involved.

We need to stop treating ""self-diagnosis validity"" as a universal position and start treating it as a context-dependent question. The answer for transgender identity is different from the answer for autism is different from the answer for DID.

We need to be able to say:
- ""Self-diagnosis of gender identity is highly accurate and should be trusted""
- ""Self-diagnosis of autism is moderately accurate and should be respected, especially given barriers to formal diagnosis""
- ""Self-diagnosis of DID is highly inaccurate and professional assessment is crucial""

All of these statements can be true at the same time. They're not contradictory. They reflect the actual nature of these different conditions and the different data we have about self-recognition accuracy.

My biggest takeaway personally? I need to stop bringing my biases from one community into another. The lessons I learned in trans spaces about self-determination were invaluable for that context. But they made me less effective at understanding DID spaces. I had to unlearn some things to really get it.

2025-10-28 08:35:47;Autistic author searching for readers;"I have never posted on reddit before, but tonight I am taking a chance. I am a late diagnosed autistic author of Y/A scifi and have been stonewalled by the traditional publishing industry for nearly two decades. A few years ago, I decided to self-publish the first book of my series on Amazon. At the same time, I entered one writing competition with the same title (Monsters of Camp Erehwon). Much to my great joy I was awarded the Silver Medal in the Nautilus Book Awards in 2023.

Unfortunately, without the power of a publishing house, press agency, and authors representative my stories have gone nowhere. It seems to be the plague of most autistic writers. The few copies that have sold have been well received, and I made the autistic books by autistic authors book list. What I am hoping to do is connect with a few other autistic adults and young adults who would be willing to give my novels a read. I really want to hear from anyone, for good or for ill, about my work. Thanks for giving this a read.

2025-10-28 08:28:38;"[OP not autistic] What kind of support/understanding do you need from ur partner when having a terrible day?""";"My girlfriend is autistic. She was diagnosed at a very young age, and it's about time I take a more serious approach to adapting/accommodating the intricacies of her neurodivergent experience. I love her dearly, and she is such a refreshing presence. Her autism has benefited us in bountiful ways, namely her incredible personality and directness. She has always been super upfront and transparent about how she feels and where she sees issues. This is oftentimes a blessing, but sometimes it can prove challenging for me to interpret her properly (exacerbated to some degree by my abandonment issues). She has put so much time and patience towards understanding my nuances; it is only fair that I reciprocate.

She has had a stressful few days, to put it bluntly. Her mom yelled at her over some nonsense that had nothing to do with her, she sat for an exam that left everyone in sheer disbelief from its difficulty, and to make matters even more stressful, after the exam she had a job interview at a business, only to drive to the wrong location.

She called me around lunch time, and I did not provide the support she needed in that moment. She hung up after a few minutes, and so I sent her a general ""Sure as hell sounds like you're having a crazy day."" She replied with ""I shouldn't have called you tbh."" I asked, ""Is there a particular reason?"" She replied, ""Just made me feel worse."" I replied, ""I'm sorry that our conversation did that. Was there a particular aspect that caused that? Was it because I was not talkative?"" She replied, ""Think about it.""

I gave it a few hours and sent her a text ""You needed more emotional connection and engagement, and I reasonably should have known that based on how crazy your day was. I didn't engage much and you rightfully felt disregarded."" She replied, ""Ok.""

I love her, and while our interaction felt quite abrasive, they only happen like this every few weeks (Her words do hurt me tho)... I suspect that her autism may be involved in how this interaction played out? She seems quite frustrated, and I want to be approaching this and further situations like this in a way that is conscious of her diagnosis. She certainly deserves understanding.

Any advice or insight at all would be great thx!!!

btw I will talk to her at length about this stuff when she is feeling better 

  
Edit context about the call we had: So she called me and she told me about her day. I was mostly just listening, as I was distracted by her having bad audio and I was thinking about the shower I was about to take. She then asked me if I was busy, so she must have sensed that I was not totally present in the conversation. After that I focused my attention, and offered some heartfelt reassurance about the exam she wrote, and her interview.";;;;
2025-10-28 08:28:21;Crashing out a bit over possible diagnosis.;"Earlier this year, I got some psychological testing done. I've struggled with my mental health since puberty, social anxiety and OCD identified, experienced some derealization, and also wondered about ADHD symptoms. I'd never gotten a bona fide diagnosis, so when mental health came up during my yearly checkup, I got a referral for the testing. 

Unfortunately, I did not read any reviews for the psychologist I was referred to, and just had the worst experience. Don't really wanna go into the details, but because of this I decided I didn't want to take that psychologist's word for anything. But the LAST thing I was expecting was for the psychologist to tell me I was autistic. I felt like someone had slapped me in the face. 

At the time, I didn't pursue getting a second opinion because I had stuff going on, and kind of moved on from it. But it's been in my head, so now I've read up on symptoms in adult autistic women: Every. Single. Symptom. on Psychology today that is listed, I have.  

I'm so upset. I know that possibly being autistic doesn't make me less valuable as a person, but when I thought these things were just anxiety, OCD, etc. I felt like those were things I could overcome. But autism feels like something that just... is. My whole life, I'll be this way; it's got me really down.  

Autism might explain some things that I previously blamed my social anxiety for. I struggle with social cues, and struggle to connect with people, even though I want to. I sometimes stutter or slur my words when I speak up. I ""stim"" (I didn't know what this was until yesterday) at times. 

So I am getting a second opinion. If I'm autistic, I want to talk to a respectful, intelligent psychologist about it. But I'm crashing out, and wondered if the community here might have some advice or encouragement for a woman who is nearly 30, finding this out about herself. ";;;;
2025-10-28 06:34:11;I want to be the best boyfriend for my functional autist girlfriend but don't know how;"It’s a long text, but I’d appreciate it if you could please read it :)

I’ve been dating a girl with functional autism for 1 year and 5 months. We’re both in our 20s (I’m a bit older than her), and I’ve learned a lot from this relationship. She was only recently diagnosed, after a complicated episode earlier this year.

To give some context: at the beginning of the year — specifically, in early February — she vanished off the face of the earth. She had warned me last year that this might happen, but this time it lasted much longer. From February until the end of June, I had no news from her (she would only send me a short message at the start of each month with a brief explanation, and on my birthday she made sure to spend time with me somewhere quiet and even made me a small cake).

When we finally started talking again, she told me she’d been having constant anxiety attacks and didn’t feel capable of talking to anyone (she was only speaking to a gay friend of hers who was going through a deep depression and might have been one missed call away from attempting suicide). It was a really difficult time for me — not only because of her absence, but because I couldn’t understand what was going on in my head. I felt abandoned, like she had stopped loving me.

Her diagnosis came about because her psychologist and psychiatrist were trying to understand what had caused such a long episode, and that’s when they reached that conclusion. She’s always been someone who tells me that if something’s wrong, she’ll say it — or that if she gets angry with me, I’ll know — and that’s always been true. But I’ve always been an insecure person (I’m in therapy myself) and I constantly feel like I’m never enough for anyone.

Even so, I always try to give her all the support I can. Right now, she’s not studying (she’ll start next year), and because of her current situation and recovery process, she’s also not working. She doesn’t have much money, so I always try to help her however I can. Recently, she lost the headset she always used when going out, so I made sure to get her the one she had always wanted. I also lent her my old laptop so she could work on her portfolio, made her dream come true by taking her to see her favorite band in the VIP area, and more recently, I helped her buy a new phone (I lent her the money until she can pay me back, but I don’t pressure her about it).

Her father passed away in 2021, and every year around that time, she tends to withdraw a bit. This year, the day before that weekend, she sent me a message thanking me for everything I’ve done for her — saying that I make her weeks better, that she likes me very, very much (she’s incapable of saying she loves someone), and that I’m helping her achieve the dreams she had as a child. I almost cried on the train when I read that.

She’s the kind of person who, if I ask her to do something, rarely says no. She always agrees to go wherever I suggest and prefers that I make the plans so she can just come along.

She disappeared again last week, but lately these disappearances have only lasted one or two weeks. And even though I’m kind of “getting used to” these situations, I still feel sad when they happen. I’d really like some advice on what I can do — I want to be a good boyfriend. She always tells me that I am, that she has nothing to complain about, but I always end up overthinking things. I start imagining that she’s hiding something, that these disappearances only happen with me, and that she keeps talking to her friends during that time (though she has very few friends and doesn’t leave the house except with me). She has serious difficulties communicating through text; she always tells me she never texts anyone, and that she makes an effort to text me daily, or almost daily.

2025-10-28 05:47:31;NT here, why do I get along better with NDs but find it so difficult to get along with NTs?;"Hey guys,

Recently after a few bad experiences at work and my social life I've realized how difficult and complex the whole concept of socializing can be, but when I think about it more, I've never had problems getting along with neurodiverse people, just talking to them is so much more engaging, and they don't really let stupid social cues get in the way of socializing and in general its just more fun to talk to them, I find I can talk to them for hours and its always been a mutual thing. I've got a handful of friends that have Aspergers, high functioning autism, Tourette's etc and I adore them. With neurotypicals I always feel so stupid and lost trying to talk to them, I don't know why, its like they care so much about small rules and always being so PC and in the one instance you're not , you're painted as a bad person or labelled. I'm not diagnosed myself but have thought I might be slightly on the spectrum? Ive been told my directness and brutal honesty can be off-putting sometimes or rude even though that wasn't my intention yet my ND friends appreciate my directness as I do theirs. After finding out what NTs think of NDs in general, and finding out my NT friends' attitudes towards NDs, it makes me feel sad that they're not willing to let go of their prejudice towards them and if they did they could see how ignorant and unfair they're being. Can anyone enlighten me about any of this?";;;;
2025-10-28 05:30:53;Do you also notice people start to resent you just for existing?;"Hello, I am new here. I hope it's okay that I post here--I want to be respectful to those in the neurodivergent community. 

I'm not diagnosed. In fact, it never crossed my mind once that I could be autistic until coworkers and friends and even Reddit users began asking me directly if I was or making jokes that I was. 

So I don't really know if I am or not. But I have a lot of social issues and sensory struggles (my dry hands have caused me to break down into tears a few times) that have haunted me since I was a kid. 

So I'm curious if this is a thing too for anyone here:

I notice that people begin to resent me over time at every place I work, or any social group I try to be a part of. It feels like they dislike the fact I'm literally just *existing*. 

I always seem to be doing something wrong somehow, and I never know what it is. People react weird to the things I say, the way I engage with them, or even my facial expressions. 

I think I'm acting the same as those around me. But most times, I'm just staying quiet and keeping to myself. 

The most I do is just smile and laugh when it's appropriate. And this somehow bothers them too. 

I can't read social situations. I can't detect people's subtle mood shifts. I don't understand humor. I can't tell a joke or even tell a lie.

All of that upsets my coworkers somehow.

Especially the joking. My male coworker (I'm 29f) seems so put off that I can't understand his jokes or give it back. Be seems frustrated by this. 

Why is humor such a big deal? I don't care to be funny.

Why can't I just be me without it upsetting most people I meet?

I've had to leave so many jobs because people are so put off by me it becomes so uncomfortable at work.";;;;
2025-10-28 04:39:48;Why are neurotypicals (expecially old ones) always so butthurt?;"So yeah they always get offended at the smallest things and I just can't with them sometimes!

Today at work I had few spoons and was less verbal and so I asked my coworker to stop talking cause I wasn't interested and she flipped out saying I was so rude and like I didn't say shut the fuck up just please stop talking, and even when I apologized explaining my diagnosis and stuff she still was like I don't talk to rude people 

I also wear a macaron with my pronouns and neurotypicals are so butt hurt by it! Meanwhile my new autistic friend was like can I take a picture so I remember to research this pronoun I didn't know? And that was a lovely interaction! 

Like you can't even stare into space with neurotypicals around because they'll accuse you of staring at them!!

Meanwhile I always need to accommodate them! 

Sorry this turned less into a question and more into a vent but yeah";;;;

2025-10-28 03:05:18;Need some input regarding my traits;So I finally started the long awaited journey of figuring out what’s ’ wrong ‘ with me. And decided to take an online assessment for both adhd and asd with my mom’s input because I have zero recollection of what I was like as a child. When reading out the questions to her I ticked yes on pretty much all the adhd traits ( which I knew anyway) but the autism one left more grey area. We determined I have no sensory issues and never have, no issue with eye contact as a kid ( suggesting it might just be my social anxiety), no issue responding to names, no issue with physical contact, no issue with imagination or playing with other kids ( i actually had a very vivid imagination back then), and no noticeable difficulties with social communication. However I did do a lot of the stimming behaviours such as hand flapping and jumping whenever I felt restless or excited ( never when I was nervous/ anxious though) . As well as always having to have that ‘ thing ‘ I’m interested in and refusing to talk about/ engage in anything else most of the time ( exclusive to childhood) and would usally last between 3 weeks - 5 months. I still get these fixations now but they’re way less intense and I desire to talk about different things and what others have to say these days. I was also very particular about things as a child and enjoyed lining things up in alphabetical order and imitating collection vids on yt for whatever my interest at the time was, as well as having meltdowns whenever I lost anything, I could and did enjoy playing games with other kids however I’d always be preoccupied with whatever I was interested with at the time. I’m sorry if this post seems incoherent I just wanna know if at face value this sounds more like audhd or just adhd, and if my ‘ autistic traits ‘ are seen in adhd as well. I am in the process of getting a diagnosis at the moment but I live in the uk so I could be looking at years waiting and just wanna learn more about myself before then, thanks to anyone that read sorry if it’s a bit messy lol. ;;;;
2025-10-28 02:36:11;Becoming disillusioned with the concept of autism;"I am not trying to claim that we don't have real difficulties. But I am more interested in a world of perfect information, where we understand everything would autism be a diagnosis or would what we think of as autism be separated into multiple different disorders? 

It seems like autistic people can be so different from each other it's hard to believe we all have the same root cause wrong with us. The diagnosis also isn't objective and seems arbitrary, if you have sufficient difficulties in a broad enough number of categories you are autistic, but there is no objective way of measuring if these difficulties exist and no way of measuring whether those difficulties cross a severity threshold.

I see people come on here asking if they have autism or not because they don't have a deficiency in a certain area like eye contact or whatever and I just feel like writing why does it matter? It's not like it's a real thing, it only exists so society knows somebody has a problem and there is an existing framework they can work from to help that person.

Do you echo this sentiment?";;;;
2025-10-28 02:21:03;I need help;"Hello everybody! I am a 24F med student. All my life I've known something was off with my learning. 

When I was 3 my mom brought me to therapy because I wasn't talking yet/a little sensory seeking. While I was 3, I just randomly started talking. The only word I ever said was ""that"" beforehand. My mom said that whenever I said it, it made sense. I would only say it if I wanted something and point to it, or if I wanted to go somewhere I would always point in the direction and say it. One day when I was 3,  I just randomly started talking full sentences. My mom said she can have a full conversation with me and I wouldn't repeat anything. All my other milestones (including walking which was early) I met on time.

The sensory stuff wasn't that much, just like a deep hatred for the fire alarm cuz of loud noises. I soon grew out of that and I don't really crave or don't like any sensory stimuli at all. I am fine just how I am. (Sometimes I do hate getting dressed up and would rather wear a sweatshirt but who wouldn't lol). At therapy they said that I'm not autistic. They said to my mom ""whatever she has is small and this is what you want your kids to have since she's super bright"". 

In first grade, I was put right into reading intervention. I would cry and scream when trying to read with my mom because I didn't understand it. I was never tested, but eventually made it out in 4th grade. I can read old words super well (all I do is read for school like 8 hrs a day), but I still have trouble with some big new words esp medical terminology. (I am a bit better now because I need to hear the word a few times and med school is very repetitive, but at first my friends would make fun of me because I couldn't read or remember the words at all). I still struggle with spelling and have difficulty with random words at random times (I could not spell ""speech"" in this lol). 

When I was 8, I went to see a psychiatrist for anxiety. She said no autism, maybe if I am alone on the playground in 4th grade, but nope...had tons of friends! Also- I had an IQ test done around that time which came out undefined or whatever. My mom (believes- still waiting to send scores) that I scored low in visual spatial reasoning and high everywhere else but idk. 

All throughout high school I only did ok. I was in no honors or AP classes. I got A's & B's (but my class was super smart so I was in the bottom half). I just don't know. I cannot simply read from the book or the powerpoint. I need to rearrange ALL of the material (which takes FOREVER) because I need to learn it in a whole to part way. I cannot learn it fact by fact like normal people. It drives me nuts. Every time I try to learn fact-by fact it does not work. I was finally diagnosed with ADHD in 10th grade, and in 12th grade I was put on the right meds. I actually had my highest GPA ever the last semester of my senior year (99.5). 

I did great in college because I had the motivation/concentration (ADHD meds) and the time (to reorganize my work). I worked harder than anybody else (classes + 12 hrs worth of studying daily), graduated in 4 years with 2 degrees and a a 3.94 gpa. Did terrible on the MCAT, but still got into a US med school right after. 

Not even 3 months later, I got into med school and I STRUGGLED. I did not have time to rearrange things like I did in college. I failed my first ever class. The first two years were rough. Finally we studied for our boards (which really helped because I can see the big picture) and I ended up doing above average on the boards and above average on tests now. 

I went to a learning specialist to try and get diagnosed with dyslexia (the issues with reading plus my whole-picture thinking scream it). However, he only did a informal 30 min assessment and tested me with normal words. Like I said, I read stuff for 8+ hrs a day everyday. I need to be tested with nonsense words as they only show my struggle. 

The odd thing is- he thinks I'm autistic. He said the thing is though- I am socially fine. However, I guess a lot of autistic people think like me whole-to-part. I am very expressive of my emotions and I can pick up social cues right away. In fact, I want to go for psychiatry because I am so good with social cues. I am also very expressive and very imaginative. I also do great with empathy and on the tests. I am a lil awkward, but I contribute that to my social anxiety. I've never had a problem making friends and my biggest strength-I am VERY self aware (which is why I'm in med school in the first place). I know a handful of girls with ASD, but they do not remind me of me. The learning specialist agrees with all of this.

He did say I have some traits (which I do agree with more than a full diagnosis) I can be a bit younger acting- I like stuffed animals and I like colorful clothes, but a lot of these interests I get from my friends. I am a little quirky- but that's just me. I have lots of friends, and I get along great with others. That's all that matters. 

This learning thing has affected me so much within the last few years. I know it may not seem like it since I'm in med school, but it does. He thinks I have a high IQ (which I don't agree with) and that's how I made it. The learning thing affects me way more than any sensory, social thing could even come close. Like the learning thing is a problem in itself. I get autism can affect learning, but this just seems like an isolated issue in itself. 

I talked to my last night and she believes I was diagnosed with visual processing disorder, however not sure. I want answers please lmk if anything comes to mind.";;;;

2025-10-28 01:22:20;Growing up undiagnosed with unaccommodated ARFID;"\*\*Trigger warning for discussions of food/nutrition/weight/hunger

ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder) is one of the aspects of autism that I feel like people have only just started discussing in the past few years. I (32F) wanted to share my experience with it because it was absolute hell during my childhood and it's something that I'm still struggling to process five years after being diagnosed. Unfortunately, my undiagnosed autistic mom only made things worse for me, and it's really hard for me to reconcile that fact. 

Sensory issues with food have been a constant in my life. When I was about 4 or 5, there was a solid year straight where the only foods I could safely eat were dry cereal and peanut butter sandwiches. My mom would negotiate with my to get me to eat a slice of cheese with these two safe meals for extra protein/calcium. Despite being below average weight my entire childhood, I had high cholesterol at this time, probably because I was eating so much sugary cereal.

My mom also has sensory issues with food, but she has never understood that or acknowledged it, which makes sense given the time period she grew up in. While I am sensitive to texture, she is sensitive to taste, and the vast majority of her cooking was extremely bland and plain, which only exacerbated my food issues. For example, an average dinner she would serve would be plain chicken, plain noodles (no sauce), and plain cooked vegetables. She didn't use any salt, butter, or seasoning. I would gag when trying to eat these meals, especially the plain cooked meat. 

I also think my mom had internalized ableism around her own picky eating, so she was strict with me about my picky eating. My only option was to eat the food she provided or go hungry, so I was constantly hungry because I physically could not force down this food. By the time I was five, when I would go trick-or-treating or go to a birthday party and get a goodie bag, I would strategically hide candy around the house so that I would have something to eat later because I was constantly going hungry. 

My parents didn't consistently give me multivitamins to make up for my nutritional deficits, either, so around puberty I started breaking a bunch of bones. It started when I caught a basketball wrong in fifth grade and broke a finger. That same year, I broke another finger, a toe, and my collarbone, all from pretty mundane activities. I went on to break yet another finger and my foot in high school (from tripping over a curb, something that shouldn't have resulted in a broken bone). At the time, this felt very mysterious to me, but looking back now, it's clear that I was kind of malnourished. 

By the time I reached high school, I had declared myself a vegetarian. My mom told me that if I wanted to be a vegetarian, I was old enough to feed myself and she wasn't going to cook special meals for me. However, she had never taught me how to cook, so I had no real way to feed myself. I basically survived off of sandwiches and pasta for all four years of high school. 

Looking back now, it's a miracle that I didn't develop any other kind of eating disorder. To this day, I constantly have snacks on me at all times. I'm scared of feeling hungry because it was such a constant in my childhood. I know some of it was the time period I was raised in (90s/2000s) and the parenting philosophy around picky eating, but it makes me really sad that my parents didn't try to accommodate my needs or show more empathy. 

It's hard for me to look at my mom in the same way after realizing all of this. And the irony is that I find myself easily accommodating my mom's picky eating. For example, when she comes to visit me, I choose restaurants that I know will have foods she can eat. I cook a separate serving without spices/seasonings for her. It's not hard to do.

My husband enjoys cooking and has never once shamed me for my sensory issues with certain foods. I continue to be a vegetarian but eat a pretty wide variety of foods now as an adult. It turns out that adding seasoning helps with a lot of my texture issues. And the fact that my husband never pressures me makes me feel safe to try new things.

Sorry this is so long, but this has been on my mind for a long time and, although it makes me feel vulnerable to admit all of this, I wanted to share. ";;;;
2025-10-28 00:52:46;At rock bottom - self harming, signed off work, not coping. Cannot get help. Adult diagnosed autistic and ADHD. Anyone been able to get out of this type of hole? UK.;"Hi,

I've suffered from issues my entire life, and it seems to happen in cycles. This year has been the worst I can think of. My confidence and self worth has plummeted. 

I've found it increasingly hard to cope in busy areas, I cannot use public transport due to the triggers, I can no longer work in the office. I panic when outside, I scream and breakdown, I have panic attacks and pass out in shops. 

I've been begging the local GP to help, I've had ambulances called out after attempts to hang myself a few months back. My arms are sliced to ribbons. I was diagnosed with ADHD combined recently but not yet given medication - I hope to god it works, because all I can do currently is lie down, look out my window and cry all day. The last time I was this bad I took a bread knife to my neck, and another instance I tried to drown myself.

I called connexions and mental health support to chase and beg for support but I was advised there is nothing to help unless I want to call 999 if I'm in immediate danger

What the hell am I supposed to do? Do I need to die first before I am taken seriously and given support?";;;;
2025-10-27 22:15:19;Help me figure out if I am asexual or if this is a sensory thing or something else??;"As a general point, I have a fairly low libido in the sense that I don't frequently want sex with another person. In the right circumstances I can masturbate fairly frequently (sometimes more than once per day), but it's possible that is out of boredom rather than any actual sexual impetus….

I think I have felt sexual attraction (in the sense that merely looking at someone makes you want to have sex with them) maybe a couple of times ever in my life, and only if there is some aspect of the person’s personality that I also find compelling. I’ve done a fair bit of reading around what sexual attraction feels like for most allosexual people, and I find it quite hard to relate to. For the most part, I don’t feel sexual attraction to anyone, including my wife (even though I find her aesthetically attractive). However, I can get sexually aroused once I start being sexual with someone - I think this is called ‘responsive desire’, as distinct from spontaneous desire. 

The problem I have though is that reaching a state of responsive arousal requires pushing through a period of intense sensory discomfort, and I’ve been finding this harder and harder to do recently. It’s always been there to some degree, which I always attributed to the discomfort/awkwardness of engaging in sexual activity before being aroused, but since getting my diagnosis I now think it is more of an autistic sensory issue. 

As I say, it has been getting worse recently, to the point that I’m really struggling to be sexual with my wife at all. I cannot push through the sensory discomfort, and trying to do so actually makes it worse. I feel like I am traumatising myself by trying, and it also feels unfair to my wife that I am essentially feeling grossed out (sometimes to the point of nausea) by kissing her or touching her sexually.

I have not been fully honest with her about this. We’ve always been quite mismatched sexually - she has a high libido, is very forthcoming about finding me sexually attractive, and has said multiple times that sex is important to her in a relationship. I have shared with her that **sometimes** I find it a difficult sensory experience, that my libido generally is lower than hers, and that I don’t place as much importance on sex in a relationship compared with companionship and emotional and intellectual compatibility. But I’ve not told her that I don’t feel sexual attraction to her the way she evidently does to me, as I know that is something she feels insecure about (especially if I turn down her advances, which is increasingly often), and I’ve not shared just how intense the sensory aversion has become.

I know I need to be honest with her, but I’m a bit confused about what to even say - should I be coming out as asexual (or perhaps grey-asexual)? Is this more of a relationship compatibility issue, whereby the problem is my lack of sexual attraction to **her** rather than my sexuality *per se*? Or should I be approaching the conversation as a request for sensory accommodations (albeit ones I think she will find difficult to accept, e.g. no kissing)?";;;;
2025-10-27 21:18:26;How to cope with a changed image of your parent(s)?;"Let's say I never connected well with my parents, especially when I was younger (I'm 41 now).  
They were too strict in comparison with other parents, too conservative and too dominant in their projections and it was impossible to talk to them on a simple, human level. Shouting was their idea of dialogue.

When I got older I attributed a lot of this to their own upbringing and outdated view of raising kids. When I finally got diagnosed with autism, other things clicked and I can safely say they're both on the spectrum - which possibly contributed to their lack of self-knowledge, empathy or self-improvement.

So I made peace with the fact they weren't the best parents around. They did their best and although I expected more, they did taught me some things about life I find useful and I grew up being not a bad human so they must have had some good influence on me.

When I was 20 I left home to be independent. I was actually sick of the tensions and expectations at home. I did want to become a teacher but I had a lot of anxiety starting with college because I've had a rocky school career and my mother told me I wasn't able to go for higher education. After 3 years of shitty jobs, I gathered little of what was left of my savings and started teacher training at college.  
I paid everything myself, while working, which was very difficult, but I got some help from friends who invited me for dinner and also my parents who gave me 1000 EUR during my 3 years of college.  
  
I still don't know how I did it but finally managed to get my teaching degree and started working.  
Ofcourse teacher pay for beginners in my country is very low for the first 5 years so I was still struggling a lot with poverty, practicing no self care at all - just working, had little to no social contacts, constant financial stress and anxiety and just feeling generally like a bigtime loser although I just managed to become a teacher.

This period in my life gave me a lot of health issues that still linger on this day. I still have financial stress, I still have this weird eating disorder, smoking addiction, low self-esteem, anxiety and an irrational fear of living on the streets.

Back to my parents:   
When I was in college and struggling, my grandfather died and my mother, her sister and her brother inherited the money from the sale of his house and another property. I never asked for any part of that money, never asked anything about it really.  
The moment she got the money, I constantly saw my mother in new dresses, they bought a new car, new furniture, went on vacation a lot...but I was happy for them, enjoying their time after working 40 years. I was sure she wouldn't spend it all at once: she was always talking to us about saving and investing and I did hear her mention something about an investment. 

Fast forward to last year: after my mother had a mild stroke 4 years before, now it was my dads turn. His stroke was so severe we had to put them both in a retirement home because independent living was out of the question. It just wasn't safe anymore.  
  
So me and my 2 brothers took over their finances to pay for the, ridiculously expensive, retirement home and to manage all the other stuff. We noticed there was hardly any money: just about 10.000.  
We asked my aunt how much they each got from the inheritance: **175.000.**

So we asked my mother what happened to the rest of the money and she started lying. *It disappeared on the stock market. Someone at the bank took it. There was this financial crash.*  
Whatever we did, she wouldn't admit she spent it all so we recovered some years of transactions and finally came to the conclusion she spent it all in 5-6 years time. Mainly on clothes, garbage, vacations, handbags, jewelry + the car and remodelling the house (which was a council house ffs). We found out she also got scammed for appr. 1000/year through some shady website in Cyprus.  
We also noticed the money was in an account in her name only. She managed the family's finances anyway: dad left all the financial business in her hands and never complained as long as there were no problems. He did say a lot about her buying so much clothes but to avoid conflict, he mostly kept his mouth shut. Which I also never expected of him.

So after an excruciating 6 months searching trip - and my dad recovering from his stroke, we found them both a place in one of the cheapest retirement homes in the region. I was devastated. First I had to discover there were no savings (while they had the chance to save a lot), then I had my own mother lie to my fucking face, then I had to deal with a severely handicapped father and finally I had to put them in a retirement home that I dreaded because of the awful care and underqualified staff.  
We had to sell all their belongings to make sure there would be enough money to pay for the cheapest option there is. I felt like the poorest guy in town.

This year, my dad died from another stroke. The funeral ate up 80% of the money that was left. Mother doesn't receive enough pension and widow-supplement to pay for her monthly costs. So me and my 2 brothers will have to step in, which is impossible for me and my younger brother: we're both living paycheck to paycheck.

I still visit her. She still expects us to visit her and take her places. She acts like she didn't do anything. After an emotional rattle of me, she finally said something like ""it was my money"".  
  
In a couple of months, the image of my mother I had, changed immensely. Okay, we never had that connection but she was still this mother figure. She gave us food and clothes and good advice.  
Now all I see is a sick, selfish woman with some kind of spending disease. And yes, I know she is sick and I know she can't actually help herself but I can't help myself either.  
Because honesty and empathy are pretty important to me, I just can't handle the fact that she   
A) spent all the money without thinking about her future, her children and grandchildren  
B) still lies about it, even when we rub the bank records in her face

I still go visit her once a week and take her for a coffee or a wine. I still go on a witch hunt every time something in the retirement home isn't up to human standards. Because that is what good sons do. But I fucking hate it. I can't believe this creature is supposed to be my mum. I can't believe I had to put her (and my dad) in a home like one where she worked all her life and had nothing good to say about it. And now I have to carry this image with me for the rest of my life without any hope on reconciliation. She still refuses to admit anything, or apologize and her health is deteriorating so she probably hasn't long to live. 

All I need from Reddit is some advice, insight or a funny meme. You can just tell me how this looks to you. You can call me a retard for still visiting her or congratulate me on being the worlds best son. I just need something. This is cheaper than therapy.  


TLDR: I found out my mom is a selfish cunt and I would've never expected this. Toughen me up stranger.";;;;
2025-10-27 20:37:19;My son's friend is nonverbal--how can I best support him and their friendship?;"(TLDR at the end) Reposting here as I was told that it didn't fit the subreddit for parents with autism. I might be wrong again so I am so sorry in advance. I wanted to hear experiences from autistic folks and what works/feels best for you not from allistic parents who have not experienced autism themselves. Not crossposting because I might delete the other one. I am neurodivergent but not diagnosed with autism if that helps out with perspective here but I don't want to sound like one of those allistic people on TikTok who try to relate to autistic people just because I have other things that might cross over (like RSD or ARFID or trouble with eye contact? But I have ADHD and have not been looked at for autism because I don't struggle with interpreting others perspectives or body language or subtext (beyond thinking I suck when I someone points out my mistakes which is usually a misinterpretation lol)). I am so sorry if it comes across like that I really don't mean it--I'm just trying to figure out how to communicate my question and put it in the right place. Thank you for giving me a chance. 

To preface, these are toddlers. But as a young kid, I had a girl in my class that struggled to communicate and I, being a dumb little kid, didn't give her enough of a chance. In short, I was sh*tty to her. I wish I wasn't, but I was six and I wasn't the best version of myself. 

I want to do better this time around and treat my son's friend with all of the respect I'd give any kid. I want to teach my son the patience I didn't have and help foster this friendship. I also want to be able to play with both of them in an appropriate way that makes both of them feel comfortable. Right now it's mostly ""can you put the bricks in the bin? Good job!"" but as they both get older I don't know if there are certain things I should foster more or focus on or avoid? Like, is there a chance he would appreciate less imaginative play of ""let's pretend to be knights and fight the dragon"" and more of the task oriented ""build the Lego tower as tall as we can""? I struggle to make eye contact myself--is it better to try to make eye contact with him even if he doesn't want to make eye contact with me, or is it better to also not make eye contact when we are communicating? So far, he likes when I read a book to him (brings it over to me and opens to the first page and hands it to me), but he walks away and does something else sometimes and then comes back to me and I continue reading. Should I keep reading the whole time, or wait until he is done with his other toy and comes back over? As an ADHD person myself, I think I would prefer someone just reading as I multi-tasked, but I don't know if it might be different for him.

These kids are still very young, so I don't know how either of their development will progress, but I want to keep these things in mind as they both grow. He is in early intervention so things could change as he grows--either in terms of speech or an AAC device or other. I also plan on communicating with the boy's parents to ask some of these questions, such as his diagnosis/diagnoses and their tips/preferences for how to play/communicate with him but I thought it might be helpful to get some outside perspectives as well so I don't sound completely uninformed and make them spend their own energy answering all of my questions (I can understand how exhausting that can be from my own experiences in life).  

Thank you in advance for any experience or advice you can provide. I'd also appreciate hearing stories if others have had success stories as young kids playing with allistic kids or being around supportive adults.

TLDR: My toddler son is friends with a toddler with neurodivergent development. How can I best support this boy as well as the friendship between my son and him, and what types of play might this boy prefer when I play with the two of them? ";;;;
2025-10-27 19:01:12;Having a rant that a lot of my problems come from 'not looking autistic';"I really dont want to upset anyone and I know this sounds like a shitty thing to say but i have recently had some bad times at a family event and insulted to my face by people who dont know im autistc.

I am not the sort of person who tells everyone I meet about my diagnosis but it seems like people engage with me, feel like somethings off and resort to insulting me because of what they think is going on with me.

Hoping people can relate, it just seems that people i meet socially always detect something is off with me and most of the time i end up feeling like I dont want to see them again.

2025-10-27 16:39:27;Anybody else labeled “gifted”? How do you cope (especially with work?);"
I find work boring at best and soul-sucking at worst. 
I speak several languages, have a bachelor’s in law&economics and a master’s in global environmental studies - now I care for ESG policy in a cooperative bank. I’m bored to death tbh. I feel it’s so soulless and useless, I don’t get to think or design, I am simply reading the most boring of policy texts and compare with excel sheets. I feel like I perform mediocrely and I can’t even be bothered.
In my job before that I did projects around ecological agriculture. 
Nothing you need a degree for. I was hospitalized due to depression bc I felt it sucked the life out of me as it was so boring and perspective-less. 

I kind of always imagined myself to work internationally, change and influence and create things. Yet I feel stuck and everytime I get motivated to march out of my swamp I again am confronted by slow processes, narrow-minded and/or stupid people and my inability to either find jobs I’m suited for or to make it clear to HR people why I’d be a great fit. I’m also scared that there just isn’t any job I’ll ever fit. What jobs did you guys find fulfillment in? 

I’m not diagnosed with anything except “high IQ”, but my mum and sister have ADHD, my uncle autism, so I guess I’m just highly functioning neuro-spicy.

Tl;dr: how to find fulfilling work that doesn’t maim you mentally as a neurodivergent person? How to cope with the futility of some jobs and systems?

For some reason whenever I see a TikTok saying “don’t self diagnose” I feel super targeted. Like I feel like they are talking to ME and they wanna criticize me and say I’m a horrible person. I feel like this for hours obsessively and I can scroll on this topic for hours. 

It’s like I feel so offended to the point where I get like chest pains kinda. It’s weird that I feel like an attention seeker even though I’ve literally just told my parents and that is it. ";;;;

So I was at home during all of primary school. My parents ""diagnosed"" me by themselves with social anxiety or agoraphobia, or a problem like that, I don't remember which, and my dad told me he wouldn't spend money for a psychologist to help me since ""all these people do is read books and tell them to you"", so he told me he would cure me himself (he did this too when I developed bulimia as a teen; at least then he actually bought me a 0.99€ self-help e-book though. Ended up never reading it). By the time my mom let me join school again in 7th grade, all my teachers just assumed I had been diagnosed in primary school, which I didn't even attend, and the school's psychologist would supposedly screen me for it but COVID hit and she never did. It was really weird because all the other adults in my life definitely assumed I was autistic. I identify so much more with early childhood diagnosis experiences since I have never masked at all my entire life and everybody around me could tell exactly what I had. I still feel like shit remembering my dad telling me he was going to cure me and telling me my treatment would be a waste of money lol";;;;

I can’t seem to figure out how to maintain a social circle and have always been some kind of lonely as a result, my apartment is a total mess because I can’t convince myself to clean with any degree of consistency, I can’t convince myself to make phone calls to strangers so if I need to call to make an appointment it’s pretty much not happening, every time I have to do any kind of paper work or any bureaucratic jumping through hoops I get way too stressed out and then I don’t do it until it’s too late (or almost too late).

I can’t help but feel like a failure of a person sometimes, or at the very least like I’m still a child. And yet I know I have it pretty good relatively.

2025-10-27 14:13:15;NT people adopting ND habits?;"I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this, or if I'm the only one.

I've noticed that NT people with ND family tend to have a few ND ""traits."" 

I'm diagnosed with ADHD, and my mom is undiagnosed but clearly the source, and my sister is very clearly NT. Compared to my mom and I, my sister definitely is NT, but she also has some slight sensory sensitivities, and she fidgets with her hands a lot. She isn't distractable, forgetful, or have any traits that stick out as definitively ND, but she feels like the definition of Neurospicy.

I also have a friend whose brother has ASD. She might have ADHD, but I am of the personal opinion that she does not. Take that with a grain of salt, of course, I'm not a psychiatrist. She has a lot of vocal and physical stims, and she has a few very specific passions that almost feel like hyperfixations. 

I'm not saying NT people can't stim or have sensosry sensitivities, but it's almost like the way that they act triggers my ""ND"" alarm even if they seem otherwise NT. I tend to gravitate towards those sort of people as well, because they feel more relatable, and then I find out later that they have siblings or cousins or a parent who is ND.

It feels like a pattern, but I could be completely wrong? Has anyone else noticed this sort of thing?

2025-10-27 07:09:04;Edward Scissorhands is the unofficial movie for autism;"This is a topic that has been discussed to death in these kind of forums already, but I rewatched it recently and post-diagnosis made me see it in a very different light from when I was younger.

Writer and director Tim Burton is self-diagnosed autistic and the movie was based on his own experiences as a child of not fitting in. The story is obviously largely inspired by the stories of Frankenstein's monster, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio etc. 

So it's a classic theme, but it has enough variations and personality in it to set it apart from other works of similar ilk.

Here are a couple of observations I made. Spoilers ahead.

Edward's father (The Inventor) decides to give life to the only robot in his factory that doesn't have a face. Not much backstory is given to The Inventor, but we can determine that he's a kind soul but lonely and eccentric and although he enjoys his machinery he has no one to share it with or talk to or for that matter being kind to someone.

When Edward's father dies he loses the only person that understood and loved him unconditionally. Even Kim came to love him only when she saw that he was remarkable but initially she disliked him even more than the others.

Edward's father teaches him social etiquette, but they both deem it boring and the chapter being read makes it seem overly complicated. They read poetry instead and enjoy it much more. Edward gives a strained smile and his father encourages him.

The same theme comes back at the dinner table with the Boggs family when Bill tries to teach Edward morals and gives him a scenario of what to do if he found a briefcase full of money.

Edward choose the option of giving it to his loved ones but Bill angrily corrects him that he should give it to the police instead. The little brother Kevin scolds Edward for giving a stupid answer. 

Kim tries to defend Edward but the others won't allow it, with Bill and Kevin being aggressive and Peg not wanting to have the discussion at all. Both Peg and Bill seems to try to be kind to Edward and teach him to ultimately change him to something else, but they never really understand or accept him for who he is.

The suburban families don't treat Edward well. They are either frightened by him, mock him or treat him like a pet. He only gains real value when they discover his special talent for cutting.

They of course use him when they find out about this, which is pointed out when Bill remarks that Edward hasn't been paid for his services.

One of the neighbors, Joyce, mistakes Edward's innocent nature as being mysterious and attempts to sexually assault him. This scene commits only half-heartedly to being humorous and I think it can be interpreted differently by people.

The bully Jim is jealous of Edward and uses him to break into a home then tricks him to get caught. The police thinks Edward is crazy and aggressive before the neighbors tell them who he is. Because he's afraid and that no one would believe him (Jim is handsome and popular) Edward has to take full blame and he's deemed unable to understand what is right and wrong.

In this scene the doctor talks to the police about Edward in third person despite the fact that he is present, he calls him a ""highly imaginative ... character"". With the pause indicating that another word could have been used. He basically says Edward lives in a fantasy world.

After the arrest Edward is scorned and isolated. One neighbor says ""All along I felt in my gut that something was wrong with him"", all while they are still having the haircuts he gave them and behind them is the sculpture he made aswell.

In the final confrontation the same story repeats with Jim attempting something terrible and even though Edward saves the day he accidentally hurts Kevin and it creates a big misunderstanding and no one excepts Kim believes him. Kim was the target of the same kind of misunderstanding earlier so she knows.

But no one wants to listen to her and instead choose their own preconceptions.

Edward's frustrations with being accused despite doing nothing wrong ends in a meltdown of sorts with him destroying his sculptures before retreating to his old home to be alone.

When he simply won't be left alone, Edward is forced to fight back and Jim's final expression is of pure disbelief that Edward had this power in him. Edward ultimately decides that people are cruel and vicious and that he belongs in solitude in the castle.

2025-10-27 07:07:43;Edward Scissorhands is the unofficial movie for autism;"This is a topic that has been discussed to death in these kind of forums already, but I rewatched it recently and post-diagnosis made me see it in a very different light from when I was younger.

Writer and director Tim Burton is self-diagnosed autistic and the movie was based on his own experiences as a child of not fitting in. The story is obviously largely inspired by the stories of Frankenstein's monster, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio etc. 

So it's a classic theme, but it has enough variations and personality in it to set it apart from other works of similar ilk.

Here are a couple of observations I made. Spoilers ahead.

Edward's father (The Inventor) decides to give life to the only robot in his factory that doesn't have a face. Not much backstory is given to The Inventor, but we can determine that he's a kind soul but lonely and eccentric and although he enjoys his machinery he has no one to share it with or talk to or for that matter being kind to someone.

When Edward's father dies he loses the only person that understood and loved him unconditionally. Even Kim came to love him only when she saw that he was remarkable but initially she disliked him even more than the others.

Edward's father teaches him social etiquette, but they both deem it boring and the chapter being read makes it seem overly complicated. They read poetry instead and enjoy it much more. Edward gives a strained smile and his father encourages him.

The same theme comes back at the dinner table with the Boggs family when Bill tries to teach Edward morals and gives him a scenario of what to do if he found a briefcase full of money.

Edward choose the option of giving it to his loved ones but Bill angrily corrects him that he should give it to the police instead. The little brother Kevin scolds Edward for giving a stupid answer. 

Kim tries to defend Edward but the others won't allow it, with Bill and Kevin being aggressive and Peg not wanting to have the discussion at all. Both Peg and Bill seems to try to be kind to Edward and teach him to ultimately change him to something else, but they never really understand or accept him for who he is.

The suburban families don't treat Edward well. They are either frightened by him, mock him or treat him like a pet. He only gains real value when they discover his special talent for cutting.

They of course use him when they find out about this, which is pointed out when Bill remarks that Edward hasn't been paid for his services.

One of the neighbors, Joyce, mistakes Edward's innocent nature as being mysterious and attempts to sexually assault him. This scene commits only half-heartedly to being humorous and I think it can be interpreted differently by people.

The bully Jim is jealous of Edward and uses him to break into a home then tricks him to get caught. The police thinks Edward is crazy and aggressive before the neighbors tell them who he is. Because he's afraid and that no one would believe him (Jim is handsome and popular) Edward has to take full blame and he's deemed unable to understand what is right and wrong.

In this scene the doctor talks to the police about Edward in third person despite the fact that he is present, he calls him a ""highly imaginative ... character"". With the pause indicating that another word could have been used. He basically says Edward lives in a fantasy world.

After the arrest Edward is scorned and isolated. One neighbor says ""All along I felt in my gut that something was wrong with him"", all while they are still having the haircuts he gave them and behind them is the sculpture he made aswell.

In the final confrontation the same story repeats with Jim attempting something terrible and even though Edward saves the day he accidentally hurts Kevin and it creates a big misunderstanding and no one excepts Kim believes him. Kim was the target of the same kind of misunderstanding earlier so she knows.

But no one wants to listen to her and instead choose their own preconceptions.

Edward's frustrations with being accused despite doing nothing wrong ends in a meltdown of sorts with him destroying his sculptures before retreating to his old home to be alone.

When he simply won't be left alone, Edward is forced to fight back and Jim's final expression is of pure disbelief that Edward had this power in him. Edward ultimately decides that people are cruel and vicious and that he belongs in solitude in the castle.

But he keeps thinking about Kim and sends her snow, using his special talent without ever being present himself.

2025-10-27 06:17:40;Getting Diagnosed In Canada - Embrace Autism?;"Is Embrace Autism considered legit?  I've been diagnosed ADHD by someone who told me they suspected I was also autistic but couldn't officially diagnose.  My counselor also thinks I'm autistic but can't officially diagnose.

I live in Nova Scotia and adult autism assessments are all private and cost $4000 - $6000, but I'd really like to do an assessment and find out if I am.  It's more of a personal journey.

  
Is Embrace Autism legit within the autistic community?  It's legit the cheapest avenue I can find to have an assessment done. ";;;;
2025-10-27 05:38:24;Autistic shutdown vs trauma related shutdown???;"I need input from other autistic individuals with histories of trauma.. My therapist and I started discussing this.

What's the difference between an autistic shutdown vs a trauma related shutdown?

Pre-diagnosis I thought all my shutdowns were trauma related. I'd shut down, be unable to talk, not really move as much, dissociate, etc.

From my reading, autistic shutdowns can include dissociating. But also anything I read about the difference between the two (which isn't much) says trauma related shutdowns are dissociative and autistic shutdowns aren't. 

Clearly these two... contradict eachother.

So what's the difference? What's your experience?

Part of me is starting to think the only difference for me is the trigger. 

But clearly there's a difference from non-autistic people's trauma related shutdowns vs an autistic shutdown. 

Are what make them autistic shutdowns- being autistic? 😭 maybe not..

I read an article about autistic shutdowns and they seem to effect the same part of the brain that trigger trauma responses etc. 

I don't know.

Heeelllpppp.

How would you define the difference between the two, if you feel like there is one for you. Or if they both feel the same to you- what do they feel like?";;;;
2025-10-27 05:17:40;it’s weird how differently it’s viewed socially to describe the symptoms of your disorder and just saying you might have it/are diagnosed with it;"
I could say “oh I have trouble with memory, hearing, and paying attention”, and “I might have inattentive adhd”, and the second option gets met more with extremes. They’ll either start minimizing it, call you lazy, call you an attention seeker, or thinking you’re very disabled & always mentally ill. 

This isn’t just true with adhd, but most disorders. Like it’s viewed so much unnecessarily more extreme if you say you might have a disorder/are diagnosed with it.";;;;
2025-10-27 05:05:02;Could this be autism or something else?;"Hi everyone,
I live in Egypt. I was diagnosed with OCD about five years ago after regular follow-ups with my doctor.

Sometimes I feel a kind of nervous or tense sensation in my head, and after that I often do some mild compulsive behaviors.

When I interact with others, I’m often seen as less capable or a bit “different” from what people consider normal. This has been happening since I was a child.

I’m also quite isolated nowadays and prefer being alone most of the time.

I’m starting to wonder — could what I’m experiencing be autism? Many people around me have told me that I seem “different,” to the point that it’s noticeable in almost any group I join.

I’m not sure if this is a mental illness, a psychological issue, or maybe a form of neurodivergence.";;;;
2025-10-27 04:51:23;I’m about to get an autism diagnosis and I’m super nervous.;So it runs in the family on both sides and I most definitely have it. I mentioned it to my therapist and she made me a referral. I’m wondering what sorts of questions they ask? I like to be prepared and I’ll more or less blank if I don’t have an idea of what I’m going into. I’ve been working myself into a bit of a tizzy about all of the possibility questions.;;;;
2025-10-27 02:52:20;Sick parents and my solution;"I come from a dysfunctional family. I was physically and emotionally abused as a child, and later they tried to make amends, but always in ways that caused me deep emotional pain.

My father is schizophrenic and bipolar, and he is also a particularly ignorant person.

My mother is the most emotional person I have ever met in my life; she seems like an eternal thirteen-year-old.

Recently, all my grandparents passed away within a few months, and my father keeps saying he does not want to be alone, even though a few years ago he threatened to kill me, and I had to call the police because he was hurting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my mother has been diagnosed with cancer.

My mother has made an endless series of foolish choices in her life, in her career, friendships, and relationships. Whenever I tried to step in and help, she always resisted.

I am autistic, and I would have needed a mentally and emotionally healthy family, but I got the opposite.

Now I have the opportunity to work abroad, and I am thinking about moving there. My younger brother is safe; he is 26, I am 33, and he now lives 700 kilometers away from our parents. I am considering just sending some money to Italy to help my mother since she cannot work anymore, but aside from that, I do not want to be involved. They have crushed me and left me with several mental health issues.

A friend of mine says I am a terrible person for abandoning my parents, but from my point of view, they are the ones who abandoned me from the very beginning, and now I am just trying to save myself. I spent my teenage years locked in a room, unable to connect with anyone, while all I could hear at home were my parents screaming at each other.

I have already spent some time abroad, and being away from them was a huge relief. What do you think?";;;;
2025-10-27 01:32:17;My mom thinks I'm not autistic.;"This situation is a bit weird.

First of all, I wanted to thank everyone who gave me advices about how to get a diagnosis because it worked and I'm  getting diagnosed in 2 months.

Now about my mom, she thinks that I'm not autistic, just weird, sensitive and closed off or that I have at least ADHD (from her words). 

What I don't understand is that she thinks I'm not autistic but is still okay with me getting diagnosed  (I'm 15(F) so I can't afford it) and sometimes she called me insufferable, loud, annoying because of how I act when things changes, how loud I can be or how bothering I am without noticing that I'm annoying her. So I just wanna understand her does she thinks there's a chance or not ?? 

(Also she thinks that my little brother has ADHD).";;;;
2025-10-26 21:22:56;Why do you need to be diagnosed?;"This is a sincere question. Perhaps it’s because I live in Europe but what’s this need to have one more label. Of course, if you’re having major issues and need medication , it becomes a necessity but if you have just escaped the system, keep it that way.

Is it cultural? I’ve been labelled as weird, anti social, intellectual…… 

No angry responses. Perhaps I’m just being naive.

2025-10-26 20:29:55;Testing for neurodivergence as an adult;"Hi everyone. I hope you don't mind me joining your community. I'm a 40 year old woman who has always struggled socially, and have relatively recently decided to try and look into whether I might have some sort of neurodivergence. I can access the test privately on my health insurance, but being UK based i would still need a referral from my GP. The thing is that, Im scared that the GP will think that im jumping on some sort of bandwagon and dismiss me, so im trying to figure out what to say. My partner has said that he will come to the appointment with me  and my boss has said he would be happy to supply evidence of areas I struggle with at work. Ive previously been diagnosed with anxiety, and my Dr has been very helpful and supportive with guiding me through medication, and various other therapies so I dont want him to think im wasting his time. I've also had occupational health reviews through my employer because of my anxiety, and my GP already has a copy of their report. So I guess this could also be used as proof?

Im considering asking close friends for their observations, just so that it doesn't seem like im just making stuff up to get a fake disgnosis. ";;;;
2025-10-26 19:39:29;Burnout, cannot function;"I am seriously going though a really hard time. My son (7) is a handful, he would be level 1 however we don't use this term in Europe, and I am working very hard to get him official diagnosis to get him support at school (clinical psychologist did confirm but he also needs offically to go through specialists at autism clinic to get  the support, and the process is so slow). So I am doing a lot here, calls with school, doctors, trying to push it faster, advocating for him,  ... it's a lot, and it seems it's not moving at all. He is difficult at home, he screams and kicks furniture over the smallest things, daily.

I am diagnosed. And it's all too much. It seems all the autistic symptomps I have, had escelated by 100%. I can't handle any noise (I am getting loop earplugs), I can no longer go for coffee with a friend because I am always too tired, my body is just always exhausted, I just hate going into work (it's a new job one year contract) and people have started to notice I don't really socialize (one thing is I am not good at it, and the other I have no energy to mask), I just want to lie down and do nothing. I cannot handle touch (I used to be able to to some extend), I find it a lot to be doing stuff with my kids (my daughter is one of those mellow lovely calm girls, and even that is too much now). I used to go hiking with my dog and it made a difference, now I force myself to go on a short walk, and then hate coming back home because kids are loud. I used to take kids out to the park etc and loved it, now even dragging myself to the car is hard.

I dont know what I'll do about work. I cry every morning in the car beceuse I am tired. Last time I was picking up my daughter I had to grab the locker to hold myself as I felt like fainting. 

I think the last 7 years have led to this, but it was also other things, for example at my last permanent job I was severy bullied for 2 years by my manager and I think since then I just can't function normaly, probably also had something to do with PTSD as I was bullied at school a lot. I hate shops as they seem to bright, I can handle libriries to some extend but also less and less. My.selfharm has increased a lot in terms of pain, I actually nearly seriously injured myself because I was so overwhelmed. I've always done self harm, but never to that extend before.

Is this autistic burnout? And what to do? If I had a perm position I would take sick leave, but I am afraid to do that at temp position.

What can I do, advice please as I am completely drained.

Edit: my post was written in a way it made me sound like a single mum. I am sorry about this, I do get some free time which just makes me feel quilty because some parents don't and I just sound spoiled now. However still, all the family logistics, school trips, doctors, etc is on me. My husband took over doing homework with him and now helps more with bed time, so perphaps I am just not tough enough. ";;;;
2025-10-26 14:38:49;Autistic + (C)PTSD. Does life exist over there?;"I'm sure I can't be a single person with these both. My life is basically either trauma response or autistic meltdown - sometimes even triggering each other. I'm hardly functional and don't have any desire to go on with this. I'm not officially diagnosed (beyond a psychiatrist looking at me and talking to me and saying ""yeah that's most likely the case""). Same with PTSD - I have a constant depression diagnosis and social anxiety disorder, but it's not really hard to figure out, especially that I know my own past and present. 

The problem is I live abroad and can't get an official diagnosis for autism in my language or English - you can easily get a normal doctor appointment in English but not something like that, so I'll probably have to fly somewhere for a diagnosis or to do it online if it's even possible. Also, I don't have a fuckton of money. So far, pretty much every therapist, psychiatrist and medication give up on me, just stop working shortly after the start. No one seems to be qualified enough to work with this. 

So, if you are someone with similar conditions - you can share your journey. Did you find someone helpful? Does it even get better at all? I feel like I'm the lost case and don't want to continue.";;;;
2025-10-26 09:56:03;[US] Adult assessment: how do I find a qualified, skilled ND psychologist who can detect well-hidden ASD? Can I send them an essay beforehand since I can't speak well?;"I knew in my bones all my life something was off. I never meshed socially, never reached milestones. As is common with missed ASD, I excelled in reading, vocabulary, academics so I flew under the radar. Unfortunately, narcissistic parents didn't see the child who felt alienated, only felt safe in games or imagination or with alone time. My brother was diagnosed with Aspie, now ASD-1, but never got support.

The problems came socially and then eventually with independence, like when teens are looking to drive, party, go out, move out and/or live at college, none of that happened for me. I just wanted to continue with routines I had and had such fear around the changes. I never understood friendships, dating, and social cues were a struggle.

Into adulthood, social problems became glaring with total loss of friends and isolation. I'm now in the middle of terrible autistic burnout. I've lost all steam. I used to be pretty productive by my own standards, now I can't sleep well, find it hard to wake, can't even make a phone call or send an email. I've missed doctor's appointments. I really need to get an assessment.

Last year I went to an evaluation with a psychologist. She wasn't specialized in ASD, didn't seem to understand the ASD levels, stims, odd behaviors and masking. She was also NT. She believed autism is little boys flapping their hands, making noises and playing with trains. I downplayed my answers, froze up and omitted information.

I also failed the evaluation due to severe social anxiety and agoraphobia that were diagnosed before. Not feeling comfortable talking about myself due to trauma of being told my feelings/thoughts are worthless. New environment, the lights, the temperature, the feel of the chair. I felt sick, wanted to leave. I felt imposter syndrome.

I've fixated on ASD for years. I just need this professional confirmation so I can go ahead in life and obtain help. I need to know it's true beyond just my own hypothesis.";;;;
2025-10-26 08:51:09;How my meltdowns feel from the inside…;"I’m 43 F AuDHD late-diagnosed - 3 years ago actually this week. I wanted to share what an autistic meltdown actually feels like for me from the inside because it’s so hard to explain when it’s happening and sometimes even the people closest to me don’t understand, but I figured you all would. 

I got in an argument with my husband today because he moved the car while I ran inside the grocery store and didn’t text me he moved it. I got back out and the car wasn’t where it had been and he wasn’t answering his phone. When he called me back I freaked out because I was having a panic attack not knowing where the car was. It’s my safe space when I come out of stores and having to stand outside the store and not know where to go triggered me. 

From the outside, it might look like I’m just angry or overreacting, but it’s not me trying to fight or be difficult. And inside myself, it feels like I’m having a floating, out-of-body experience watching everything unfold before me. 

I can see myself reacting, saying things I don’t mean, doing things I wouldn’t normally do, and I know it’s not worth it. I know it’s not really about whatever small thing set it off. But I can’t stop it. My body is in full reaction mode while my mind is stuck watching, frozen. I have no control and just feel helpless. It feels like my whole system short-circuits and that’s one of the hardest parts.

What I really want to do in those moments is sit down on the floor/ground and curl up into a ball and sob, but my past trauma makes me push through it. I grew up not being allowed to fall apart or show emotions, so now it all comes out sideways when I can’t hold it in anymore.

When it’s over, I’m left completely mentally drained and frustrated with myself and physically exhausted. I end up wishing I could control it, but not knowing how. I hate that it looks like I’m fighting when I’m really just breaking down.

I’m still trying to understand it better. I’m still learning what my triggers are and how to communicate when I feel it coming on.

Does anyone else experience meltdowns like this where it feels almost like a floating, out-of-body experience and you can see yourself reacting but can’t stop it? 💙

TL;DR: During meltdowns, it feels like I’m having an out-of-body experience — I can see myself reacting but can’t stop it. Wondering if anyone else experiences it this way too.

2025-10-26 07:54:32;Do you think ADHD is AUTISM?;I have recently had this thought based on my own experience (diagnosed ADHD, now identify as AuDHD) and a lot of others that I have heard. Many people who get treated medically for ADHD symptoms seem to uncover that they in fact are also autistic. Coupled with the fact they are both grouped as neurodivergent and even share symptoms, this made me wonder if they are just different forms of one thing? I understand why it is necessary and helpful to diagnose them as different, I am just wondering if biologically the root could be the same and it just happens to be expressed differently based on how the body processes it? ;;;;

I don't understand social cues at ALL, and I've been oversharing to the point where one of my ex-friends was saying I was complaining/venting for attention. That didn't even cross my mind the *entire* time. I wanted to know what was ""wrong with me"" after that, and I discovered external processing. I constantly overshare I think, but I never want attention from it at ALL. I just feel like I need to verbalize my thoughts I guess? I've been so paranoid that I'm talking too much or oversharing to everyone I know. It's like with everything I say I have to overexplain myself and apologize profusely. I want to recognize when I'm sharing too much and stop. It feels so paralyzing whenever I have a conversation with anyone (even my friends or family), and it's getting to a point where I can't even go to work/hang out anymore without feeling like I'm going to die from how anxiety-ridden I am. I'm terrified every single word I say is wrong, and I'm paranoid that it's really impacting my friendships. Anyways, does anyone have any tips to help? I really want to start managing this without being extremely detrimental to myself. :') Thank you so much";;;;
2025-10-26 05:09:08;New therapist clocked me for something I never even thought of.;"I had an intake appointment with a new therapist the other day. About halfway through I mentioned that I am self diagnosed autistic. I was going on about how I didn't take that lightly and did all this reading and such. She said ""actually I was going to ask if you were diagnosed with autism. I do autism screenings every week."" 
I somewhat jokingly asked 
""Was it the lack of eye contact or the fact that I brought a stuffed animal with me?"" (The stuffed animal was a white rabbit named Lola)
She said
""No, actually, it's the fact that you didn't talk until you were 4."" 

Somehow it never occurred to me that that could have been an autistic thing. According to my mother I *could* talk. I just wouldn't for the most part. I'd point at things until my older sister (also autistic) would tell our mom what I wanted. I guess since I technically could talk and since I started talking eventually I thought I was just being stubborn or weird or something. Even when I started suspecting that I'm autistic I never thought of that as an indicator. It's funny how hard it can be to see the thing right in front of your nose sometimes.

Anyway, the therapist asked if I'd like a proper assessment and I said no because ""I'm afraid they're gonna round up all the autistics and put them in camps"". She said that's a valid concern, which horrified me. Existential dread all the way through to my soul. But it was nice to get validation of my neurodivergence. ";;;;

2025-10-26 00:31:40;Why autism is not an accident of evolution and why that still is relevant;"**I came across a rather positive hypothesis on autism, which suggests it is by no means an accident but an important part of human evolution.** I think **Penny Spikins** (archaeologist and author of *The Prehistoric Origins of Compassion*) explained this well in *The Conversation* piece [“What Role Did Autism Play in Human Evolution?” (2017). ](https://www.sapiens.org/biology/autism-human-evolution/)

**Here I quote the first part of the article by Spikins** (bolding and italics are mine).

# What Role Did Autism Play in Human Evolution?

Traits we often tend to disparage were—and arguably still are—critical to human communities.

When you think of someone with autism, what do you think of? It might be someone with a special set of talents or unique skills—such as natural artistic ability or a remarkable memory. It could also be someone with enhanced abilities in engineering or mathematics, or an increased focus on detail. 

This is because despite all the negative stories of an “[epidemic of autism](http://autismmythbusters.com/general-public/home/autism-epidemic/),” most of us recognize that people with autism spectrum conditions bring a whole range of valued skills and talents—both technical and social—to the workplace and beyond [Research has also shown](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-of-half-a-million-people-reveals-sex-and-job-predict-how-many-autistic-traits-you-have) that a high number of people not diagnosed with autism [have autistic traits](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x/full). So although many of these people have not been officially diagnosed, they might be were they to go for autism-related tests. These people were unaware they have these traits, don’t complain of any unhappiness, and tend to feel that many of their particular traits are often an advantage.

# The origins of autism

This is what we mean when we talk about [the autism spectrum](https://www.intechopen.com/books/autism-spectrum-disorders-the-role-of-genetics-in-diagnosis-and-treatment/the-genetic-basis-of-phenotypic-diversity-autism-as-an-extreme-tail-of-a-complex-dimensional-trait) — we are all “a bit autistic,” and we all fit somewhere along a spectrum of traits. And we know [through genetic research](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006618) that [autism and autistic traits](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7615/full/nature19075.html) have been part of what makes us human for a long time. Research has shown that some key autism genes are part of a shared ape heritage that predates the “split” that led us along a “human” path. This was when our ancient ape ancestors separated from other apes that are alive today. Other autism genes are more recent in evolutionary terms—though they are still more than 100,000 years old.

[Research has also shown](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361398023008) that **autism for the most part is highly hereditary. Though a third of the cases of autism can be put down to the random appearance of “genetic mistakes” or spontaneously occurring mutations, high rates of autism are generally found in certain families. And for many of these families, this dash of autism can bring some advantages.** ***All of this suggests that autism is with us for a reason.*** And as our [recent book](https://roundedglobe.com/books/9673edbf-0ba5-47b1-97bd-16ef244fd148/The%20Prehistory%20of%20Autism/) and [journal paper](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1751696X.2016.1244949) show, ancestors with autism played an important role in their social groups through human evolution because of their unique skills and talents.

# Ancient genes

**Going back thousands of years, people who displayed autistic traits would not only have been accepted by their societies but could have been highly respected.**

Many people with autism have exceptional memory skills; heightened perception in realms of vision, taste, and smell; and in some contexts, an enhanced understanding of natural systems such as animal behavior. And the incorporation of some of these skills into a community would have played a vital role in the development of specialists. **It is very likely these specialists would then have become vitally important for the survival of the group.**

**MY COMMENTS**

**While many are unhappy they have autism, we can be proud of the role it has had and still has in the development of society. Truth tellers, analyzers and innovators are needed to help identify risks and possibilities cohesive neurotypical people are often not able to do.** These characteristics are apparently made possible by a number of genes. And as evolution is very picky, it keeps these genes because the group benefits from diversity, even if some individuals face difficulties. **Evolution has ""concluded"" that humanity needs both: The social majority to preserve cohesion, and the analytical minority to be highly specialized, to tell the unfiltered truth and to give rise to out-of-box innovation.** Autism no doubt is challenging to most who have it, not least in these days with a steady stream of noise and sensory impressions, and with the importance of social skills as contrasted to practical skills which prehistorically would have been honed by the tendency to hyperfocus. But it is a cloud with a silver lining as autistic people still can make a contribution neurotypicals normally are not equipped to make. Processing issues analytically, valuing honesty and becoming an expert in some domain still can be valuable, but those skills probably are very domain-specific. Thus **an autistic person is adapted to less fields in life, but where skills match the needs, that match may be extraordinarily strong.**

At a personal level, I have an unusually mild expression of autism (no comorbidities, no masking, no visible stimming, very minor sensory issues, high verbal ability) I see my autism as a net benefit due to the following: I have an analytical mind, I love optimizing and trying to make the most rational choices, I lack sensitivity to group pressure and I am thus less easy to be manipulated. Yes, I know few have a positive view on their autism in the way I have and I fully understand most autistic people have far greater challenges to overcome. I myself am probably also lucky and privileged: I was a big child and thus not exposed to bullying and I wasn't diagnosed until this year so my difference was not medicalized when I grew up. My self-confidence had decades to strengthen before I recently got a diagnosis at 50 years of age.

Not all is perfect: no doubt I have less social skills than neurotypicals and I lack friendships beyond my family. This has though partly been out of my choice as I don't feel such a need to cultivate friendships beyond talking with people I meet in daily life. I can be seen as insensitive as I concentrate on facts and seem less interested in emotions. The correctness of the message is thus more important to me than building social rapport by adapting the message in a neurotypical way. This can be a recipe for misunderstandings and conflict: just ask my wife...

Like I said, **I don't mask and I tell openly about my autism. Autism itself has almost become an area of hyperfocus for me. If I could give one piece of advice to autistic people: if possible (and I know it often isn't), be yourselves and don't mask, your value isn't dependent on whether some people find you different.** I am strange, or at least very unconventional, compared to the majority and I'm fine with it. As a matter of fact when I'm asked how I as a European have adapted to Latin America where I live, I half-jokingly answer: ""The question isn't how I have adapted but whether the locals have adapted to me!""

**What about trouble getting a partner?**

**Many autistic men struggle with dating and mating success today, and that probably applied to the most severe cases in the past too.** Thus should not autism disappear if autistic persons don't reproduce and isn't autism therefore more of an accident of nature? As Penny Spikins argued, **autistic skills, if not outweighed by very heavy ""baggage"" in the more severe forms of autism, can lead to a valuable contribution and thereby to social respect or acceptance, including from potential partners.**

That’s still true today. I have a mild form of autism, and I have a wife and children. The most famous autistic person, Elon Musk, apparently has 14 children, so mild autistic traits clearly don’t prevent reproduction. But more severe autism is correlated with reduced mating opportunities especially for men.

**EDIT/Additional note:**  
Two different but compatible perspectives complement the hypothesis, admittedly in a way that is not very accessible to those (me included) unfamiliar with advanced genetics.

First, and integrating the insights of a comment to my post, recent research suggests that mutations or dysregulations in **the mTOR signaling pathway may act as a switch that reactivates ancient gene networks** related to neurodevelopment. And to laymen like me: the mTOR pathway is a kind of “master regulator” inside our cells that controls growth, metabolism, and brain development. When it’s thrown off balance by genetic variants, environmental stress, or metabolic factors, it can change how certain genes are expressed. That fits with the concept of an “ancient operating system”: evolution didn’t erase these older circuits, but it usually keeps them suppressed. When the mTOR pathway is disturbed, parts of that older system might become more active again.

Second, there’s also the **theory of retained primitive reflexes**, which my wife (a neuropsychologist currently receiving further training on the topic) finds highly relevant in her work with neurodivergent children. These early-life reflexes such as the Moro or grasp reflex, are typically inhibited as the brain matures. But in many autistic individuals, they remain partially active, suggesting that deeper, evolutionarily older neural layers stay more engaged.

Both perspectives point in the same direction: autism is less a ""defect"" and more a partial re-expression of ancient neurological systems. These systems, which once had clear adaptive value, are the source of strengths and challenges that still characterize the autistic mind. They don't prove the evolutionary hypothesis on autism suggested by Penny Spikins but they are very compatible with it.";;;;
2025-10-25 23:35:34;A larger problem/autism;It is not necessary to elaborate but is your diagnosis of being on the spectrum just one issue of a list of problems?;;;;
2025-10-25 23:33:41;Psychiatrists keep telling me I'm too old for a diagnosis?;"I'm 24, I've gone through 3 psychiatrists (they either retired or had babies), and I'm with my third one. All three of them told me, unprompted, that they are either sure, or straight up know I am on the spectrum, but also all of them told me it would be useless and time consuming for me to get a proper diagnosis, because I'm too old and too functional. 

My former psychiatrist told me to ask my (former) therapist to work out the symptoms on their own, with no diagnosis.  
I don't go to therapy anymore, but I opened up to my last therapist about this, as advised, and she spent ten minutes belitteling me, laughing almost to tears because she ""never heard of an autistic person knowing they're autistic"" (though she also told me that people can't have eating disorders unless they're ""skin and bone"" so I don't trust her very much). I felt so awful I wasn't able to talk for the rest of the session.  
I fear I put my psyachiatrist in danger, because this therapist kept asking me ""who told you that"", ""what did she say exactly"", and then that psychiatrist had to suddenly leave a few months later.

I don't understand where they got the ""too functional"" part from, since I am in fact seeing a psychiatrist (I think having BPD, AVPD and depression can be a misdiagnosis at this point, and all these struggles would be much easier to explain with asd) and cannot have a day that is considered normal especially by social standards.  
I have no friends because I have no idea how to properly interact with people (it genuinely feels like I have to read their minds, sometimes they tell me I'm not sociable enough, other times I'm ""too desperate"", so I stopped trying), I have my ways to get around sensory issues, which honestly can disrupt or ruin my day entirely, I had my mother crying when I was a child/teen because I was ""too different from the rest"", ""too childish"", when I'm overwhelmed I get physically sick, or can't talk at best, and going home playing my favorite videogame is the main thing that can recharge my batteries- these are just overly simplified experiences I had (I'm not trying to perpetuate stereotypes, at least I hope not); what I'm trying to say is: how functional is too functional?

I know I can just go and ask for a diagnosis elsewhere, but at this moment I can't afford one (not to mention I wouldn't know where to turn for adult diagnosis) and the only place that gives free assessments is the building where I'm seeing said psychiatrist, which means I need her written prescription in order to see a specialist- except she won't give me a prescription (I'm from Italy, from what I understood this is the only way to have a free assessment, via Centro Psicosociale, which is where I'm currently being treated).

I guess I'm venting, but also asking if anyone had this experience. Maybe they're right, and I shouldn't worry about a diagnosis? It wouldn't change anything, maybe. It would put me at ease though, becuase right now I feel like a fraud.";;;;
2025-10-25 22:27:50;Is weed giving me a psychosis like state? (AuDHD);"Hey. I won't really explain how I got the diagnosis for ASD (Asperger's) and ADHD,  
I'll just say it's an official diagnosis that I have gotten at 9 yo (ADHD) and 12 yo (ASD).  
What might be also important is that I'm heavily traumatized, but it's not tied to just one or two traumas,  
rather ongoing abuse in multiple forms (the only form I haven't experienced is sexual).

(It's easier for me to explain in points):

1. I started smoking lots of weed around July this year (lots in frequency, weight around 0.5g).
2. I had almost no breaks and have smoked for two months.
3. For the first month, it was mostly spliffs, before switching to joints and mainly bongs.
4. I smoked THC, didn't really get my hands on, and didn't want to, CBD.
5. The first few days were fine, no problems whatsoever.
6. Then, when I started going outside, I had experienced intense DPDR(?) states.
7. The DPDR states were foggy, and because it was mostly dark (past 8PM), there were times when I just switched and saw only the lamps, the road, nothing more than that. But these states were peaceful, calming, almost like having a mental rest for the first time in my life. A couple times, I was even looking at myself, almost literally, and saw myself through a bubble that was surrounded by a void and a standing character, which looked like it was drawn digitally, not many details.
8. Fast forward a month or two, the only state I experience now, one that I am also worried about, are the rushing thoughts and ideas in my mind. I feel like it's unstoppable, and what usually happens during this state is that it feels like my brain is literally hurting. In this state, I am somewhat aware, but see little particles instead of the way I normally see. It doesn't matter if it's loud or quiet, bright or dark.

It's also probably worth mentioning that I started dealing with it only recently, so there's a LOOT I have yet to learn about how autism and adhd really affects me. This is what you get when you're told you're fine, lazy, shit like that. Fuck my family, fuck all the schools I've been in, fuck all the doctors who diagnosed me with panic disorder. Luckily, I found the papers I was looking for.

More info that I thought about minutes after posting:

1. The second, bad state, also feels like I'm literally seeing what people may see on LSD or DMT. As I've mentioned before, I am aware of the surroundings, even can interact, socially too. But it's like taking what I see and putting one of the trip simulations on top of the normal vision, it's just not fully opaque.
2. There were a few times when I felt like I'm literally bleeding in the brain. Mostly the center, like there was a ball that was bleeding from the top, and I could feel each drop slowly go down around the ball.
3. The first time I had THC, I was in a shock. Barely able to hold a conversation. I would usually just start talking and forget the whole sentence before even finishing it. Shit was disturbing.
4. I am not planning on stopping. I am okay with searching for alternative ways, less dangerous ways, but I'm not stopping. It doesn't even give me euphoria anymore, but it works well, for example, as a way to boost my fantasy, which lead to me finding interest in making music, streaming, making videos and drawing. Basically, I wanna produce what's in my mind, which I probably don't need to overexplain.
5. An important factor to mention is that this depends on whether I'm inside or outside. If I'm outside in the dark with just my earphones, taking a walk, maybe sitting down on a bench for a moment, it switches to the first state than the second.

Thank you for reading through, and specially for providing answers that I can't get on the internet.

Last edit:

First of all, I want to thank this community. Downvoting someone just because you don't agree with someone's logic, even if it's kind of reasonable, was giving me some bad vibes, but you've shown you \*\*care\*\*.

That's rare for subreddits, so I'm glad to decide to go here in the last minute.

Anyway, I've found three most probable factors in the bad states.

1. Talking or looking into any of my mental problems (DO NOT DO THAT WHILE HIGH)
2. Ongoing stress and or panic attacks from reminding myself of trauma for hours at times
3. Heavy meltdowns, because I just need that loud music with no light
4. And lastly, fighting against it. Just accept that you get sad, emotional, flown away

Yes, I'm dumb. I'm human who's been broken. I regret not regretting at times, times that keep getting longer.  
But sometimes, life is easy this way. It's human to make mistakes, because we all do them.

Good luck out there to any trauma survivors.";;;;
2025-10-25 21:36:28;Executive dysfunction, burnout, or....?;"I'm super sorry if this is obnoxious, I know I'm asking for advice/Naming a Thing but I just want to bounce something off people that know this subject better than I do and get some direction. 

I'm having a hard time with ""Am I lazy or is something wrong?"" Like the dishwasher needs emptied and I'm floored that people empty their dishwasher for the rest of their lives and just do it. How? How do people go about folding laundry every day? There's definitely a part of me that doesn't want to, but I wish I did, I wish I could just do chores like so many other people and be kind of tidy. 

My gf and I are going on an overnight trip, no big deal, and I have my bag on one side of me and the things to put in it on the other. We leave today when I get off work and here I am, not even packed yet. Here's kind of the kicker though, I used to pack at least the night before if not earlier. It might have been an anxiety thing? I have never been good at chores, like putting my clothes away. I was good at homework in school and getting things turned in, I was a good student (""gifted"") except for math (I'm not sure if I have dyscalculia or not) but putting my clothes away was something I just like... couldn't do. My mom thinks I don't do things because I don't want to do them. And in some ways I don't. But I do. I would love to get the floor swept up, but my dog sheds like crazy and the hair takes up space in garbage can and I'm gonna have to take the garbage out and put a new liner in (and it's not JUST taking the garbage out, it's opening this door then trying not to knock the garbage bag as I open another door next to the first door, making sure the animals don't follow me outside, and then opening the final door and putting the trash out and coming back through all the doors or going through the sliding door (making sure animals don't follow me out) and walking through the mud to the trash can and then getting back in through the sliding door and the animals). It's like my brain sees all the steps and I'm mentally tired. 

I'm ftm, 36, and have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for over half of my life. Last year I had my antidepressant changed from citalopram to duloxetine and the duloxetine has helped me with some things. I'd generally pace back and forth downstairs before work, ruminating on things that irritated me and I don't do that anymore. When I was really little (like 4 or 6?) I'd do laps around my bedroom at night because I couldn't sleep, like the thoughts in my head were so loud I'd need to act them out or something. I didn't have a hard time staying still in class, but at home sometimes I'd need to get up and move. Since being on duloxetine I'm like... Almost too tired to do any of that. Like sometimes I would need to get up while telling my gf about my day but now I can just lay on the couch and talk. The duloxetine really wiped me out for a while, but I feel a lot more emotionally stable and less volatile on it. I was seeing a therapist and she didn't seem to feel I was on the spectrum. I'm also seeing a nurse psychiatrist and she also doesn't seem to feel I'm on a spectrum, which is fine. My gf strongly suspects I'm neurodivergent, but I don't particularly think I am although I do go back and forth about it. 

But anyway, with a pretty life long experience of not being good at chores I don't feel like it's burnout but I do just feel really drained from life at this point. So I don't know if this a lazy problem or there's something deeper going on that's not just laziness. 

Thank you for any insight! ";;;;
2025-10-25 19:28:51;How can I let things go and not take them personally?;"Hey all, I’ve not been diagnosed, but I have some neurodivergent friends who told me they strongly suspected I also am. Ha. Anyway, I am a few months into a new job, and the past week has been really hard with coworkers. I initially felt really welcomed and accepted, but a couple things happened recently, and now I can help but feel like I want to go into hermit mode and lick my wounds a bit. 

The first incident involved a social night last week where the subject of an international conference came up. Someone asked who all was invited, and I said I’d been invited to go. One coworker then asked “why they chose you and not me”. I played it off in the moment and didn’t make a big deal out of it, but I felt really offended. 

A couple days ago, a different coworker couldn’t find something in his classroom, and the assistants found it a bit later right next to the computer mouse. I put a laughing reaction in the teacher/assistants group chat, and then he lashed out at me. I tried to be assertive and said I wasn’t his punching bag and that wasn’t ok to go off on me like that. 

I’m in a bit of a funk now and have really pulled back on any socializing with my coworkers. I can’t help feeling like I’ve been talked down to or treated poorly and it’s hard for me to put on a smile and pretend things are ok. I don’t really want anything to do with those two coworkers at this point, but I feel like that seems like an extreme reaction. It also puts me in a weird place with the rest of my coworkers as most of them are friends/friendly. I really don’t know what to do or think.

2025-10-25 15:33:32;i cant relate to other neurodivergent people. is there something wrong with me?;"i apologize if this rant seems mean spirited. i'm just really sick of feeling so alienated.

Since i was 15, I've been diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and OCD, among other things. At first it was a really useful insight to my mind and i hoped that moving forward i could use this knowledge to try and have an easier time making friends. I haven't had an easier time, at all.

I'm autistic, yes, but i dont struggle with the things other autistic people struggle with. I dont have many sensory issues, in fact, i generally block that out, I'm competent at understanding social cues (probably a bit below average? but like theres neurotypical people who probably understand social cues worse than i do i'm sure). I dont have special interests, i do have hyperfixations (not in the slang for interest meaning of the word. as in i obsess over something for like a week and then just forget about it).

Especially online, Neurodivergent spaces just puzzle me and i feel excluded. I feel like people are too busy trying to position themselves over viewpoints or identifying with labels and it just confuses me. I dont get fandom culture. I dont get any of it. I'm blunt with my words and it causes a lot of people to be offended, especially in neurodivergent spaces where people are bad at interpreting meaning and attribute it to malice.

im just sorta sad because my 'community' online is neurodivergent lgbt folks. and there's nothing wrong with that i guess but i just cannot mesh with those sorts of communities online because i find them immature and offputting. that isnt me being hateful or anything (i am lgbt and obviously as said, neurodivergent) im just really weirded out by those spaces (again, not because of the people but because of the behaviors of the people in them. which i hope isnt me being mean or discriminative or ableist, sorry.). i dont have any friends online really. or offline, because im honestly in a pretty terrible depressive spiral. for a long time i've just tried blaming others and just figured it was just kids being chronically online but the thing is, there is no alternative. there's no place for people like me online. am i the only person with this experience? geniunely asking here, is there something wrong with me and the way i experience autism/adhd?";;;;

I've always been proud of the fact that I saw the world differently, this just validated it.

I'm suddenly more aware of how alienated I feel trying to communicate with neurotypicals, I always have been but it just feels more acute now that I'm aware of the reasons why.

My life partner is one of the only relationships in my life that feels entirely understanding - they have experience with this. I'm eternally grateful for that and the love we share. It feels quite serendipitous in that regard and they encouraged me to seek out a diagnosis.

My problem is that I'm resenting people I work with and I barely have any friends because I feel like I'm not understood fairly, respectfully and appropriately and I battle to understand them and their rationale.

I feel like I'm from another planet. Can anyone relate?

2025-10-25 14:20:01;Friend’s reaction to my autism diagnosis left me speechless.;"Got my late diagnosis recently, and I was talking on the phone with one of my best friends. This person is usually very open-minded, but this seems to trigger something. I was very shocked to get these reactions, and it seems like it’s not possible for them to accept this for whatever reason.
(I suspected it for a while, and I got very uncomfortable suspicions from this person that I just made it up, even though it was fairly obvious even before the diagnosis.)

The immediate reaction when I told them about the result of the evaluations was:
“Everyone is a bit on the spectrum, you just overthink things. That isn’t a real diagnosis.” (It definitely is.)

After mentioning that I was uncomfortable and that I didn’t understand at all where those reactions came from, since we went through many tough times together, the response was:
“You act like you’re the only person in the world who has a mental illness.”

I was actually speechless after that. I mumbled something about it not being an illness, first of all, and secondly that it was really fucked up to say that, but I haven’t responded much to it until now. What do you guys think? How do you deal with a good friend being unable to accept your diagnosis due to some incomprehensible personal issues? This definitely made me very careful and doubtful about disclosing my diagnosis to other people as well. ";;;;

2025-10-25 10:50:29;Work experiences before diagnosis;"Hello everyone, I wanted to come on here and ask if anyone has ever had any bad work experiences before they were diagnosed and later when they looked back on it realized why it didn’t work out. Before my diagnosis my longest job was only 4 months, every time I had a job I eventually quit because of the horrible social experiences not even with customers but with coworkers. It seemed like my coworkers would get incredibly annoyed and frustrated with me for seemingly no reason, It felt like anything I did would make people angry at me and I never knew why.

At one job, it was at my parents friend’s restaurant, and I tried to be a server. That was a total shit show. I made mistakes, and said things to customers that got me in big trouble and I was so upset and confused. The owner that my parents knew would always call me to talk to me, and eventually started threatening to fire me which made me ultimately decide to just quit because I felt like nothing I could do would fix what was going on. I later realized part of it was just inexperience, and the other part was just not saying the right things, I would end up trying to copy others and saying stuff that others said and it just never turned out right because I obviously wasn’t able to do it right because of communication and social deficits. 

I was so clueless to why these things were happening and also the things I was doing. Embarrassingly enough when I was a server for that short time, I got too comfortable with some customers around my age and said something which I thought was a light joke talking about a tip which they actually reported me to my manager and so yea.. that didnt go well at all. I also was a host at another restaurant and ended up walking away from a table that asked me to bring them another dish and legit wiped the plate with my shirt and went over and handed it back to them within full view, that obviously didnt turn out great either, I actually got yelled at by that table. 

Even after I got my diagnosis I tried another job, this time it was a retail job. I still had communication issues and social problems with my coworkers, some treated me worse than others did and I guess they just had more issues with me. Asking for visual instructions made them mad, asking for clarification made them mad, asking for help a lot made them mad. One manager even said to me “so I have to be sensitive towards you but you cant be sensitive towards me,” and that made me really upset, like I’m just asking for some understanding for my deficits, she was able to do things I cant because of my disability and I feel like people always assume that us asking for a bit of accommodation is wanting everything to be about ourselves when thats literally not the case.

Most of my issues was with my coworkers but I still had issues with customers too, i’m sure you can imagine. Things I said or how I acted got frequently taken the wrong way by customers and I would get yelled at frequently where I ended up having to go to the back to cry because I’m very emotionally sensitive unfortunately. I felt like I did better when I was able to help people find things on the sales floor because I really liked talking about makeup, it was a special interest of mine and it was a makeup store. I felt like I just had more social issues with people at the cash register but unfortunately I realized later that they had kept me doing newbie stuff and kept refusing to let me do more, even though I had worked there for at least a year at that point. 

While working there I realized everyone else in my same position was getting paid at least a $1 more than I was which made me quite upset. They never let me train new people, they always asked more new people to do it even though I had a lot more experience and at times I even had to help the people training with training the new hires. When I had tried to ask to train more people I felt like I was kind of worked around in the conversation kind of like a communication manipulation to say no without directly saying no. 

Anyways yea, working sucks and I decided I wasn’t going to try and work again until I get approved for employment services because maybe then I will have a better shot.

Well, I don't mind speaking in public I do it on my own but I'd like to improve because when I give presentations I have a huge gap between my technical knowlodge and my soft skills. And with that I miss some oportunities. 

Does anyone have some tips, since what to do, some different therapy - focused in that (since my diagnosis is New).

Once I also read about an app to autistic people improve soft skills.

2025-10-25 06:58:37;Has anyone gone for a private autism diagnosis and found to be neurotypical?;"I have some autistic traits and have been suggested by some that I might be neurodivergent. But at the same time I have neurotypical traits, and possible BPD traits. I'm happy to pay for a private assessment to not have to wait on a 2 year waiting list. But my fear is if I pay for one, and the outcome of the assessment is that I'm neurotypical, I will have wasted potentially £thousands.

So, my question is, has anyone gone for a private assessment and the results were that you were not autistic?";;;;
2025-10-25 05:32:35;What is it like having both autism and adhd?;"Ok so i got diagnosed with adhd a couple years ago but I’ve also felt for awhile that i might be autistic as well.

So if you have both,  it would be really helpful to hear about your experiences because I don’t really have anyone in my life to really ask about this . 

Also just to clarify :
I am aware that it’s a spectrum and not everyone will have the same experiences
I won’t be reading these replies and deciding that I’m autistic based off of that alone, I am doing plenty of research outside of this and if I get the opportunity in the future I am going to try to get a diagnosis to confirm it

2025-10-25 04:24:58;Bouncing as a Stim?;"New to this sub, hi! 
I’m a f, 29. Diagnosed with ADHD since 11 years old and re-diagnosed again as an adult. I have suspected ASD, however one trip through the NHS diagnosis system is enough for me. 
I need to know if this is just me! 
I, without fail, bounce on the spot for at least an hour a day, on average probably 3. I have always walked with a bounce (since I could walk according to my mother) and used to have a little trampoline in my room as a child. 
Does anyone else have similar, know anything about this or have any other cool quirks?! 
";;;;
2025-10-25 04:16:33;How to operate until my assessment?;"So friends, family, ex partners, my therapist and psychiatrist (who doesn’t diagnose adults and told me that I should start operating like I have already received a diagnosis, but I’m not entirely sure what that means) all suspect that I have autism, possibly audhd, but the wait list where I am going is 1.5-2 years long. I am in the US, have state funded health insurance, and can’t afford to pay out of pocket at a private place, so this seems to be my only option right now. 

The way that I am heavily impacts my life, work, relationships, etc. I am very hesitant to self diagnose. I was reluctant to even seek out a professional diagnosis for years. I don’t know why. Denial or internalized ableism maybe. But my life got to a point where I need to know. I need to have the language, I need accommodations, and I need to be able to advocate for myself. I feel like this would all be easiest if I had an official diagnosis, but it’s so far away. 

I don’t even really know exactly what I’m asking for advice on. I just feel kind of stuck. Maybe others can relate. ";;;;
2025-10-25 00:29:47;Job interviews are the bane of my existence. So I wrote this guide for us.;"I’m autistic (late-diagnosed) and interviews have been a nightmare for me. I struggle with understanding job specs, getting answers out under pressure, and handling curveballs on the spot. Advice from (well meaning) job coaches helped a bit, but didn’t fit how I think.

A month ago or so, I put together a guide based on peer-reviewed research.

2025-10-25 00:14:29;Suggestions for the mods - Rules;"Official Meta Post  

We’ve been working on new rules for a few months now, since April. We’ve hit a stump so we’re asking for tips/feedback. 

Here’s some of the new rules we’ve been working on (we can only have 15). We’ve combined some that were essentially the same thing.  

  - Be kind (This will include no hostility, personal attacks, bullying, bigotry and continuing online arguments, following people around threads/posts/subs and tagging/showing usernames of other users/mods/subs on reddit)  
  - Follow the posting guidelines (This combines the old rules of check the wiki faqs, low effort/spam/clickbait/ragebait/duplicate, no self diagnosis debate (as that would now be a stale topic), no stale topics (a regularly updated page in the wiki listing topics temporarily or permanently banned because they’ve been done too much). 
  - Pseudoscience and Misinformation  
  - No medical advice (This combines asking if you are autistic/someone else is autistic, posting online test results, giving medical advice).  
  - Mature content rule (If it’s not appropriate for a 13 year old, it needs to be marked NSFW. Alcohol, drugs flagged as NSFW. Sex education is fine, but graphic sex posts, posts about libido, type of sex, etc, get redirected to our NSFW subs.).  
  - Online safety (No personal information or pictures)  
  - No advertising/fundraising.  
  - No politics (includes petitions but excludes news). 

There’s other topics we need your opinion on before we make a rule. These topics are:   
  - AI usage, images and text, apps made from AI or with AI that people try to post here.   
  - What is considered off topic? Would a recurring themed megathread be a good idea for the off topic posts? Do you have any other ideas to keep off topic at bay in the main feed?  
  - How do you feel about people posting screenshots of their messages and asking what went wrong or what the person means? Is that on topic? 
  - Engagement is low on posts with no images. Memes already aren’t allowed but that doesn’t get enforced well because people don’t report it. What can we do to make this more clear?   
  - What is included in advertising/marketing/fundraising? Someone who wants to make an app? Someone who is writing a book? Someone who already has a product made? Something that is free? Social media profiles like someone’s youtube? Someone who has an idea and wants options on it? Etc.  
 - What are some stale topics?  

Any other things you think we are missing that should have rules?  

How would you word these rules to be clear and concise?  

And lastly, when we do change the rules we will make a post. This post will be highlighted permanently at the top of the sub. Should we 

1. keep it short and link each rule to a page in the wiki that gives a more in depth description with multiple examples or  
2. put everything in the post  

***Please keep all meta discussion to this post, all others will be removed for off topic.***

Meta means posts about the subreddit, its moderation, its users, or posts made in the subreddit instead of posts about the subreddit topic, which for us is autism.";;;;
2025-10-24 23:45:06;Share your aspie comfort tips;"Recently I saw a post with cool aspie hacks, tips and so on.
(BTW did anyone yet create special sub for accumulating such aspie wisdom so to speak? It would be great.)

And as a late discovered / self diagnosed person I found many of such tips helpful, but previously non obvious to me.

Like it never naturally occur to me (probably because I was destroyed by trauma and masking and had to reinvent/recreate myself) that I can just listen to my favourite music 100 or more times in a row. I had this mental block that it would somehow be psychotic, not normal. But today I gave it a try and I literally listen to single track all day and that is super comforting.
I didn't know I can do that.

Share other tricks and tips, obvious and non-obvious.

Here's mine:
I use this rhythmical gymnastics that would probably be pleasant for some aspies. Look up ""гимнастика ключ Хасая Алиева"" or ""Метод ключ Хасая Алиева"". It's healthy and comforting.";;;;
2025-10-24 23:06:11;Desperately want to stop scrolling and be more intentional with my time;"Hey folks, I'm a recently diagnosed adult suffering from burnout. Like many of you, I was diagnosed after working a stressful corporate job. I was lucky enough to take a break from working and find a remote job, but the burnout has been slowly creeping back in.

As I get increasingly burnt out, I find myself binging on mental junk food like reddit and youtube. I know this isn't helping my mental health but at times doing anything else feels insurmountable. Even turning off the feeds and starting a video game feels like a lot.

I've tried the app blockers, but I find myself just disabling them. If anyone has any other tools or techniques I'd love to hear them. Thanks!

2025-10-24 21:39:21;What are the most common problems you face as a result of your Autism/ ADHD/ AuDHD diagnosis?;Hi all, I am a fellow late diagnosed AuDHDer and after my diagnosis I became a lot more aware of several problems and daily annoyances that I very clearly learnt to ignore over the years. However, after I got diagnosed and certain things were pointed out to me, I find that I’m constantly picking up on small problems and annoyances that are a result of my AuDHD or are made harder to deal with because of it. What are some problems/ annoyances that you as a neurodivergent individual or the caretaker of one, experience pretty regularly?;;;;
2025-10-24 19:05:35;How relevant is developmental delay to the diagnosis?;"Reading at my maternal and child health handbook, it seems I was a normal child at least until around 4.
But starting in elementary school, I struggled with bad habits like forgetting submission, telling lies, and being sloppy. I ended up dropping out of high school, and now (21yo) I live on welfare. I skip work, and honestly I just drift along without thinking, heading toward hell. I've already gotten a diagnosis on my own at the hospital, and to deepen my self-understanding, I'm going to see another doctor soon, this time including my mother. But my mom will surely tell the doctor I was normal. I don't know what to believe anymore. Do you think there was some mistake in my diagnosis of ASD?";;;;
2025-10-24 11:09:22;Looking for dating advice as a recently diagnosed autistic gay man in his 30s.;"
And to add to the difficulty finding a partner I live in rural area with a small dating pool.

I'm functional autistic with a job and not a model but decent looking. ";;;;
2025-10-24 07:24:52;Very nervous to go to my appointment for ADHD/Autisim diagnosis;"Logically I know there is nothing to be nervous about so I'm not sure why I'm nervous. I had always been told by my GP that he suspects it most of my life and it's genetic on my dad's side, but was never formally diagnosed, recently I thought I would benefit though seeking a diagnosis and then therapy specifically for it since I feel like past therapy I had didn't understand me and my problems.

My appointment is next week and idk maybe I'm afraid because I'm extremely high masking I'll be too ''normal'' or accidentally lie or something. I tend to not be able to get the words out of my head quick enough and say things that are like only adjacent to what I actually mean? Or I habitually script and will just say pre-prepared things. Maybe I'm afraid to be diagnosed too even though it feels correct and I don't really see autism or adhd as negative in my life personally. I think labels just put me off, but also I feel like I need the diagnosis to be able to improve my life rn and get proper therapy that works for once.

What is the test like/ what was your experience? And do you guys have any advice? I'm probably asking stupid questions because probably someone NT wouldn't even be worried about this lmfao but I'm still anxious for no reason.";;;;
2025-10-24 06:23:14;Can these be a special interest?;"I’m a woman, self-suspecting and about to have an evaluation next week. I had an autism diagnosis through Embr*ce Autism, before I knew they were a scam. I have all the signs of autism to some degree or another but I’ve always been uncertain if I have a special interest.

In elementary school, all I did in my free time was read or watch documentaries. I maxed out my library card and would read over 29 books a week.

In middle school, I became obsessed with one direction and could tell you literally everything about them, but hid this interest from my parents because I was afraid of getting in trouble. I even taught myself how to do each members voice/accent. In college I developed a similar three-year phase for BTS. 

The most long-standing thing I can think of as being obsessed with is actually a trope. Since I was old enough to read, I sought out and wrote my own stories about this one concept, called “found family” or “Families of Choice”. It is pretty much the main kind of media (books, films, otherwise) I consume - from childhood even to this day. It started with the embarrassing “adopted by_____” stories on Wattpad, and now I just seek out that trope and write it myself. But I’m not sure if this can be a special interest.

2025-10-24 05:38:33;Diagnosed as adult. Now what?;"Got my official diagnosis today.  I'm in my mid 30s and my autism has had a negative effect on my life, especially in the last, but Zoloft has helped a lot with anxiety.  


What's my next step?  How do I accept this diagnosis and try to mitigate the effects of it on my life? ";;;;
2025-10-24 04:45:07;Diagnosis Headache - where do I go from here?;"In Nov 2023, my therapist suggested that I may be autistic. This came as a big surprise to me even though I have several neurodivergent family members. She has autism and has a lot of experience working with neurodivergent people. So I went away and did hours upon hours of research, questionnaires, workbooks and started to see where she was coming from so I went to my GP and got referred.

Sept 2024 rolls round and I finally have my ASD appointment. At this point, I have done so much personal work and research that I am having a whole identity crisis and struggling massively with imposter syndrome. I started using ASD comping mechanisms and it greatly helped me but that just made me question myself more. Anyway, I had the appointment and to cut a very long story short, it went very badly. The doctor was short and rude and I just had a terrible time. In the end, I was told I “ticked every box bar the social category because you have a functioning relationship with your boyfriend.” Wtf?

Obviously I complained and I’ve now reported the service to the ombudsman. But I then spiralled further into feeling like an imposter, feeling like a fake, that I was self diagnosing incorrectly and I’m a problem harming the real ASD community. It was horrible.

So I contacted my university and they have an insight psychiatrist. He met me and we went through everything and in the end he said he can’t fathom why I wasn’t diagnosed and has wrote me what is called a “working diagnosis of ASD” document but doesn’t count as “full” diagnosis as he can’t offer me that paperwork.

After all this, I have no idea how to feel. Am I or aren’t I? Am I allowed to “claim” I’m autistic at this point? I’m also certain I am but then I also feel like I’ve gaslit myself into this position. I desperately need advice.

As of July 2025, I heard back from the ombudsman who told me there is nothing they can do other than look into the email misconduct that happened after it all (this woman was super rude in the emails to me) but that’s all. They said they can’t do any referrals or get me a second opinion or remove the information from my profile. I can’t afford a private assessment.

This has completely messed my head up further. I feel I can’t accept myself and this is affecting my mental health massively. I feel like I’m going insane, especially when I experience what I believe to be meltdowns because I spend the whole time further gaslighting myself that I’m making it all up. I’m so unbelievably exhausted.

At this point, I’ve taken to just saying I have ASD but when I do I feel an incredible amount of guilt so I don’t tell people very often. Any thoughts?";;;;
2025-10-24 04:29:25;How reliable are tests?;"I know they're not a diagnosis. But I'm going to therapy soon because I have high suspicions of being an Aspie.

Just wondering: how accurate are these? I did an Aspie Quiz some time ago and it says I'm most likely Asperger. 

I don't exactly remember which test it was. I just remember it was one that a lot of people recommended.";;;;
2025-10-24 03:59:20;Failed exam;"My daughter (12F) is being evaluated for possible ASD. 

Today I received this correction for your music exam. The teacher sees her answers as not very elaborate but I, who know her, know that it is not because of a lack of interest but because she is extremely literal and parsimonious. 

She still does not have a definitive diagnosis, although the professional who is evaluating her told me ""I don't understand why she wasn't diagnosed before, to me it is evident that there are many ASD traits and some ADHD"", so she still does not have any adaptation at the institute.

 Do you think I should talk to the professor now or is it more prudent to wait until I have the diagnosis in my hands? I feel completely helpless watching his grades drop so quickly when the question begins ""describe.../interpret.../imagine that...""

(In the images the questions say ""describe the sound in the image in your words"" and she answers ""engines/orchestra/silence"").";;;;
2025-10-24 03:50:48;I go through phases of not talking but I literally CAN’T speak sometimes;"This is a separate post. I am 23F, diagnosed AuDHD and PTSD. I also have something called selective mutism, it’s basically like I literally cannot speak. Earlier in the year, around April-May, I literally just could not speak. 

I feel I have explained this aspect of my life over and over and over and over again.

But, neurotypical people see this as an offensive act, that I am ignoring them or giving them the “silent treatment”. Which is not the case, I just literally cannot SPEAK, especially when I have a lot of anxiety or really overwhelmed. Autistic shutdowns and sensory overload also impact this area of my life. 

There have been countless of times where NTs in my family or other living situations want or even DEMAND me to speak, it is not that simple at all. I even have had coworkers question me about why I am so quiet or if I am upset. 

I am not upset! 😭 I SWEAR!! 

This has caused so many issues in my friendships because people think I am mad at them, or expect me to talk to them. But, I literally CAN’T.

I try to write things down, I try to text to communicate, but neurotypicals can’t read tone over text so they see it as an argument. I try to add emojis, or smiley faces or whatever but then they just assume I am passive aggressive. I am not, I am just TRYING TO CONVEY that I am NOT UPSET. 

Whenever I explain, they are always like, “I know you have these problems, or xyz, but we need to talk, or we need *you* to talk.”

They say they understand BUT THEN THEY DON’T! 

I don’t know how I am not getting this point across or if people really are just that ignorant. 
I have felt like neurotypicals just do not like or educate themselves on autistic traits in general. 

";;;;
2025-10-24 03:43:57;i don't know if im autistic and im super mad about it;"(f20) so, here's the tea

i can't get a diagnosis cause i still live with my parents, don't have monthly income and generally i'm not independent yet. i had a talk with my mum about going to therapy - never again, i felt so ashamed. 

as a baby (a pretty little one, dont wanna drop too much personal data) my parents took me for evaluation. one doctor said there's definietly something wrong (as in: neurological shit such as autism), the other said that i'm completely fine with just looking at me. so, the child is fine, parents happy. 

the problem is that this ""fine"" child turned out a weirdo who struggles to socialize and most of the time is an awkward sidekick, cries because everything is too much (recently late buses were my last straw, pretty embarassing to cry on a bus stop, dont recommend) and has weird sensory issues such as not eating fat from meat cause the texture makes me wanna puke (there's way more of that, i can even make a list). my friends who knew or know autistic people has already compared me to them. For example when i told my bestie that when i was younger i used to murmur to myself words that ive just said, his reaction was: ""i had a friend who did that. he had big autism."" and again, there was more of comparisons like that. 

that's it. im mad and confused, but mostly mad.

";;;;
2025-10-24 03:43:48;Can ADHD and OCD present as autism?;"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD within the past 2 years and the diagnosis’s make sense for me but I still feel like it doesn’t explain pieces of me. I have brought up the idea of autism to my therapist and they just write me off saying I’m too empathetic (which I know isn’t indicative!) and even if I did does it matter? I’m diagnosed with and treating the ones that could lead me to significant harm so what’s the point in testing - which hate that too. 

Examples that I feel aren’t explained with adhd and ocd:
- I hyper-fixate on things from years and years like history events or personality types. Specifically with the personality types (zodiac signs, mbti, etc.) I tell people that it is because I use these to better understand others and give logic for their actions. I get stints of hyper-fixation related to creativity and they tend to go away within a few months, this is different. 
- I have a really hard time understanding algebra or hypothetical math but LOVE statistics or real world math. It feels like I’ll be taught one thing and solve a question perfectly but on the next question it is worded or the formula is different and I can’t grasp why or how. 
- I have a hard time showering or washing my face on a schedule because I hate the feeling of running water or splashed water on my face but have always loved swimming. It’s just the pressure or lack of pressure, the repetitive beading against my skin etc. and I only wash my hair twice a week so on days I need to shower without washing my hair I literally dread it because it is opposing my normal routine. 
- My hair never feels right. It’s either too heavy, too hot, too dry, too greasy and I can smell the grease, too crunchy, too fluffy or too flat. I will not wash my hair for a day and I’m trying my best to not scrub my scalp with a brush when to others it looks great. My hair looks great down but feels better up however I get headaches when it’s up or get sore spots that feel like my hair is being pulled out. 
- I have rosacea and if I have a flare up my whole day is ruined. I’m rubbing my face because it’s hot but then the grease from my face is now on my hands and on my phone and it all feels so wrong (not in an ocd, contamination way). No matter how much I wash my hands or face I can just feel the grease and how hot my face is. This typically comes about when I am stressed or in a work meeting, heightened emotional or social situations.  
- When I get overwhelmed I just shut down and everything seems to be fight or flight. Too many emails? never open my email. Too many people? Leave immediately. Too many dishes? Ignore them until I can’t anymore. When things get too hard or too stressful I want to run away and it takes everything in me not to pack my bags every other week. And it’s with things I don’t understand mostly, relationships, school, work, and conversations of things I don’t quite know about yet. 
- I look EVERYTHING UP even things that could hurt me. If I don’t understand it, Google. I have so much useless knowledge because I love learning and feel as though I am not complete without knowing everything. I have so many books on things I don’t even care about but I know everything about it. 
- I try to see everyone’s point of view but also have a strong defined line of good and bad and put things into those buckets constantly to decide my morals. I will learn someone’s point of view if they are a terrible person with harmful views so that I can know what I shouldn’t say or do. 
- the last one that started this thought process which is insane: I love crocheting. I’m not saying people on the spectrum all love crocheting but for me it turns my brain off and gives me the freedom to be creative while predicting the outcome with repetitive actions. 
- ADHD and OCD typically show addictive personalities to cope however I have never had an addiction aside from a disorder that lead to my ocd diagnosis. I hate the feeling of being out of control or having a looser grip on reality. I barely drink and I’ve tried to take a gummy once and hated every second because I didn’t feel like myself. 
- EVERY aspect of myself has a reason. My favorite color is because of my birthday. My favorite movies is because I relate to the character etc. it’s like I am prepping to be interviewed about every little piece of myself constantly. 

So sorry for the long post but, is this just adhd or ocd? Or is there something else at play?

2025-10-24 03:36:10;I do not allow myself to have relationships or love.;"I am 23F, diagnosed with AuDHD and PTSD. 
And, if I could be single forever, I really think I would do it. 

I have had 2 official relationships. The first was when I was 17 and the guy was 21, yikes. So maybe, that ruffled my feathers a bit, and turned me away from dating. This was way back in 2019-2020. 

My second relationship was in 2022, and ended December 2023. The guy cheated. Took advantage of me. 

I also dated a girl super briefly when I was 16, but I don’t consider this a real relationship, because it was brief and it wasn’t serious just us being teens. I think our “dating” was less than 2 months.

Since then, I don’t know what it is but, I prefer being single over being in a relationship, or even dating. I usually do not even entertain the idea of dating to people. I am very firm in my boundaries. Usually, whenever I am with people I make jokes about myself and my single-lifestyle. So, it’s not like I am single and looking for anything either. 

Lately, I struggle with people confessing feelings for me, that and when I date people it’s like I can find a million other reasons to stay single. In addition, I have had in the past of women who I was friends with get jealous and possessive of their male partners or they see me as competition. 

Of course, this has not and never has been the case. 🙏🏼 I don’t know how to politely tell people that I do not want their crusty boyfriend. 💀

Whenever I am with a guy, I can find like so many reasons not to date him. “I don’t like what he says,” “I don’t like how he touches me.” “I don’t like how he smells,” “He annoys me,” “He doesn’t give me space.” etc. 

When I am with a girl, I do not experience this. I almost find myself thinking of more reasons to see them. But, I also keep it strictly just to casual dating. 

I tend to only sleep with men out of self-harm, instead of having attraction for them. I end up sleeping with women because I genuinely like them and enjoy them as partners. I do not usually enjoy men as partners. I also do not usually speak to men, either. Male friendships are few and far in between when I reflect and look at my relationships.   

I feel like this revelation makes me an aromantic lesbian. But, I don’t know if this is accurate, so I just label myself as queer. 

I also tend to have self-destructive patterns with relationships in general. I don’t think I deserve to be loved, and for some reason even if I like someone it makes me feel on edge and hyper-vigilant. I am always waiting for the next bad thing to happen. 

Currently, I have a very good partner who understands this, and knows my past history with sh. But, we are not in an official relationship. We enjoy the companionship, and the intimacy and that’s it. They are very understanding, and overall a great partner. 
But, I do not *let* myself have relationships? or *let* myself be in a commitment. I feel like I am very self-aware when I make these observations. 

Does anyone else experience these emotions?

2025-10-24 01:44:10;How do you guys manage your time while doing something;"I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but I think I really need to approach a specialist for a developmental thingy. A simple tasks takes me 3-5 hours to do. I'm tired of always being the last person to be finished with an exam or activity. Regardless of how much I know about it, I feel like I always makes things complicated for myself. Mostly overthinking, compulsively doing a thing, hyper-independence; avoids asking others for help even when needed, perfectionism, and sometimes, I feel like I have to chill because I'm doing too much. When I work on a school activity, I tend to hyperfocus; no breaks, no peeing, and I avoid being distracted, yet it takes me a long time because I'm slow too even If I try to keep up. It's making me hate doing a school activity and tend to avoid doing it immediately. ";;;;
2025-10-24 00:27:03;Is self diagnosis valid?;"I know this is an iffy topic. But it came to my understanding as for now that I kinda self diagnosing myself as one . Many other ppl do, I’m not looking for attention like that just understanding.i don’t have enough funds to even afford the testing .

I came here before and ask the same question. It wasn’t met with good intentions,so if you can please be kind ( it’s my second time coming back)";;;;
2025-10-24 00:00:02;formal assessment for autism ADHD feels incomplete...other experiences?;"So my psych prescriber and neurodivergent life coach both believe I have autism level 1 and likely adhd as well just not the restless/hyperactivity piece.  

Psych recommended formal testing so I just had my first intake.  I was really confused by the end because I felt like I wasn't asked hardly any questions about how symptoms or traits of these diagnosis show up in my life or affect me.  Wouldn't they be asking lots of questions?  

All she did was ask me for a brief overview of why I was recommended for testing, I didn't expand a whole lot on that as I figured we'd explore more later, so I just told her for my sensory meltdowns, difficulty with social overwhelm or needing to feel rehearsed, and impulsivity.  She then proceeded to ask questions about whether I had trauma and a little bit about my career background and previous diagnoses.  

Then she went straight into asking me to recall numbers and then name items that start with certain letters.  Then she said that was all and that I needed to take the online test which will be one hour and be able to detect all diagnoses.  

I asked her when we would be going over more of how criteria for autism and ADHD show up for me? She said this is all we will do.  

What!? lol 

So I explained to her a bit more about how I feel autistic like tendencies disrupt my life or challenges I have had in different contexts, and a little bit more about why my provider thought ADHD fit as well.  

I went on for about 10 minutes since she was still listening and then she goes ""well all these things will be caught in the online test."" 

Did I just get connected with someone completely incompetent or am I over concerned here?  ";;;;
2025-10-23 21:40:00;am i neurodivergent?;"
i am still in school about half way through secondary school and ive noticed something over the years that i am not normal, i struggle with processing information and with talking to people, i hyper fixate on certain things for a long period of time like halo, batman and dark souls (these are stuff ive loved for my whole life but i go through periods where i focus more on them).
there are materials i find absolutely horrid to even think about like foam and wool (i have struggles wearing my full school uniform due to it) and i have a terrible time focusing. i have high sensitivity to light and certain sounds (not just scraping plates and stuff everyone finds irritating) and certain materials like wool and foam send genuine shivers up my spine.
i struggle with social queues and piss people off alot of the time because i cant recognise where they are coming from or cant figure out a response and im constantly told my stupid by everyone around me and i feel out of place every where even with my friends (some who are autistic or have ADHD).
i am diagnosed with C-PTSD, GAD and Depression so it could be factors from there. 
i was tested for ADHD, ADD and ASD but my mam never showed me the results and just told me but she is openly against neurodivergent disabilities and says ""they are just excuses"". i want to see my diagnostic records but i have no way to see them and i need to know how i can get them in Ireland as a 16 year old without parental consent because i feel if i dont get the supports i need i wont go far in life, im already significantly behind everyone in my year and its causing more frequent episodes (my depression is life long and my mother doesnt want me to get medication especially when it gets bad and the supports system in Ireland suck especially for teenagers) i just feel like a sore thumb and dont beleive my life has any purpose.
am i anywhere on the spectrum or even show signs of ADHD?
another thing to include is i used to have MAJOR melt downs as a child and it would be over showers or other small stuff that used to irritate me like certain foods i would be forced to eat. 
im not asking for a self diagnosis because in my opinion its absolutely stupid since you cant actually get help or supports but i do beleive its perfectly fine to acknowledge you have these traits and be suspicious that you have something and see a professional about it.";;;;
2025-10-23 19:35:50;Do you get called out for snapping at people out of nowhere?;"25F and I was diagnosed with AuDHD less than a month ago. Ever since I’ve had many lightbulb moments and everyone around me says the diagnosis seems on the spot for them.

All my life people have told me that I snap at people randomly. I don’t recognize it often but I know I can be very rude and I feel awful afterwards but in the moment I can’t help it. I’m doing my best to work on it and it’s got better but I still struggle.

The process is the following: someone says something that I don’t like -> I react super serious or even rude -> the person is shocked -> if I notice, I apologize -> I go from serious to neutral then nice again because I feel bad and I want them to know everything is okay and it’s just me being randomly jumpy.

People say that they're super confused by all this of course.

The thing is, that thing that I don’t like is 99% of the times completely normal. For example, me having to repeat something cause the other person didn’t hear me or I wasn’t clear enough. I don’t know if it’s impatience or something getting in the way of my idea of a perfect interaction/role of that person in my life. I still haven’t figured that out but that’s the ideas I’ve come with. I don’t even know how to describe the feeling I get when it happens (I’m looking on alexithymia and see if that rings a bell).

I thought it could be the AuDHD cause it also checks out as “something that no matter how hard I tried, I could never fully learn” like sarcasm. There are lots of things in my life that I’ve never managed to learn to a certain point and now I know that it’s everything related to the AuDHD ofc. I’m still figuring out a lot and seeing how my symptoms manifest.

I don’t want to hurt the people I love. I do this with my family, friends, significant other. Everyone. Does this happen to anyone else?";;;;
2025-10-23 19:05:24;I think I'd go insane without work... (Long post about my work history and thoughts on being undiagnosed until 36.);"I've been working full time since 17. I graduated high school early because it was hell. College seemed unnecessary, loads of debt, and I was terrified of the social aspect of it. I love work. Work is easy for me. There is a set of instructions. Do this, then do this, then do this. 

I take these instructions and refine them to be as efficient and streamlined as possible. I then make it a game in my head to see how fast and accurate I can perform these duties. This is how I spent my first 7 years in retail. 

When I moved to the corporate world this game in my head continued. I wanted to be the most knowledgeable, the best at everything there was to learn. I mastered my duties and then I asked for more. I rarely, if ever, spoke to anyone. I just focused on the work.

I would run reports at odd hours and send them out via e-mail... just to build the illusion that I was ALWAYS there and ALWAYS on. 

I would also get bored once I had mastered a job and would ask for tasks assigned to other jobs so I could learn that side of the business. There was an older guy at this office who I never actually saw working. He would just sit at his desk and talk to people. It drove me crazy.

So, I made it my mission to be as friendly as possible to him and volunteer to take any of his day to day or week to week tasks. I was able to learn more and I was also trying to strip away any actual work he was doing so he would be left with nothing.

Well, I did that and he continued to just do what he did. Screw around and talk to people. Everyone loved him so nothing happened. 

After 6 years at this company they asked me, and another, to found their new division. It was me and a new hire who would be my boss. The boss did ALL of the socializing which included vendor and customer negotiations. I ran everything else including warehouse, accounting, pricing, data, CRM, website, etc, etc. 

The division grew, but I was shown no increase in salary from it so I left after 4 more years. The next company was interesting. It was a sister industry and I got to try my hands at IT software development. I was a Business Analyst, basically working with executives and developers to build changes into the custom ERP.

I brought the same intensity as I had at my last job. For example, during a Go Live weekend we were mostly holed up in a meeting room but something was wrong with the warehouse so I got up and ran to the warehouse. I probably looked strange but I didn't care. The problem needed solved and so off I ran. 

I worked here for about 3 years. It was a fun company. Got to travel to Europe a few times and meet colleagues overseas. Some good memories and I wasn't judged NEARLY as harshly for my strangeness. In fact they seemed to like me more than my other American colleagues.

Eventually I left this company. Mostly, I said because of salary but honestly it was because I was bored. I had solved and refined everything that needed to. My mind was getting bored. 

I went to a different company and helped them stand up a new division including building them an e-commerce site integrated into their ERP in their 10 month window. After that I volunteered to manage this new division and to help centralize their Pricing across all of their locations. (Again, because I was bored and wanted another challenge.)

I was at this place for 2 years and was recruited to another company during Covid. I joined them and have been with them for almost 5 years. I ran their e-commerce division and created a new Sales Operations department with a few analysts under me.

The job is fully remote but over the past two years I have been SO bored. Bored out of my freaking mind. I've automated and refined everything I can. So now it is the same day over and over again to infinity. 

I've tried recreation. Video games, movies, reading, etc while I'm working but it doesn't scratch that itch. It just makes me more bored. I need a new challenge. 

Luckily, I had someone reach out to me this week for a potential new role at a local company. I am excited! Hoping I get it for the challenge.

**Final Thoughts**

Now having said all that about work I find it funny how I wasn't diagnosed as ASD1/autistic until 36 years old. I remember getting so angry at people who would sit and talk at work. I wanted to scream at them quit talking and start working. Talking is irrelevant. Work. Work. Work.

I had this same intensity when it came to exercising. Go. Go. Go. Don't stop. Just constant action.

Somehow, through all of this, there was a women who showed interest in me when I was 18. We were together until 36. Ended up married and had a few kids. The only reason we got together though, I believe, is that I was an extreme safety net. She never had to worry about money or a place to live. She came from a broken home and was abused. 

I loved her, still do, but I knew even then, at 18, that there was something wrong with me. I buried it deep and ignored it. Instead focused on the work and exercise. It was a strange marriage with little sex. I realize now, that I'm probably asexual or a variation of it. Sex never really mattered to me. 

Eventually, about 16 years in, she healed from her trauma. While she had her trauma she acted similar to me. Very reclusive and quiet. We had each other and that was all that was needed. However, as she healed, she became more and more social and then eventually moved beyond me. 

I've had a few relationships like this afterwards. A women with trauma comes to me and I do my best to be as stable and routine as I can with her. I never really show emotions but I am a great listener and will sit there for hours just listening to them. 

After time passes though they realize I don't have much more then that. I am not romantic. I am not spontaneous. Everything operates on routine. Everything is strictly planned and laid out. I have thousands of pages of notes from my work history I catalog... but I also keep notes and catalogs on people while I'm dating so I can try to remember things about them. 

Now, at 39, and single... work is what keeps me going. I pay my exwife about $60,000 a year in alimony and child support. I see my kids half the week but outside of that... I work. I don't think I'll ever retire. I'll just keep coming to another challenge.";;;;
2025-10-23 15:49:56;Increasing anxiety/rumination about something specific, not sure if it's because of my autism or something else;"I'm already diagnosed autistic so I'm not asking for opinions on that, moreso I'm just trying to understand why this is becoming such a problem and how to approach/talk about it with my psychiatrist when I see her.

I'm also diagnosed with ADHD, CPTSD, and a dissociative disorder (severe childhood trauma, etc), so I have a psychiatrist to prescribe medications. I take something for anxiety as well as my ADHD meds, and we've been sort of experimenting trying to add some stuff to help me with sleep issues/general mood stability (I'm PDA profile specifically, which was mistaken for bipolar when I was a teenager).

Anyway, onto the issue...

I've started to seriously struggle with the fact that my dog is getting older. I know that's going to sound kind of silly at first, but I can barely even begin to explain how seriously distressing it is for me.

I adopted him from a shelter 10 years ago, when I was 21 and in an abusive relationship. He had a lot of behavioral issues at first, having been abandoned as a stray, but I poured *so* much love and time and patience into him and he became the best friend you could ever ask for. He's now my registered ESA, the smartest and sweetest and most loyal little guy you could possibly imagine.

Together, we've been through multiple abusive living situations, two off-leash dog attacks (I've got scars but he doesn't!), homelessness... He's been my rock, my anchor, my everything.

In the past few years, I've been through an inordinate amount of loss. An unborn daughter, a mother-figure, all four of my grandparents, my marriage, and my (human) best friend of 15 years. All are dead now, and I have next to nothing/no one left. My family is unsafe, I have no truly close friends and no partner. More than ever before, my dog is who I live for.

But he's 11 now. He's very healthy and youthful for his age, and I do everything I can to keep him that way, but the gray is starting to show up around his muzzle... And the pure terror I have of the day I have to say goodbye to him has started to overwhelm me.

Every time I look at him, snuggle up to him, let my mind linger on him and how much I love him for more than a minute, I start shaking and crying. I'm generally not really someone who gets all that scared about much - I've survived so much that it's kind of hard to phase me these days - but this is a level of fear that's physically painful. I've spent nights rocking desperately trying to shake the thoughts, but I can't.

I'm losing sleep over it, but even worse I'm losing out on enjoying and being in the moment with my best friend. I can't play with him for more than a few minutes before it hits me. I keep playing of course, but this isn't how I want to spend my time with him. I want to be able to savor every minute.

I'm really rambling now, sorry. This is just a super emotional topic for me that I've never been able to articulate to anyone before. I'm too scared to even say any of this out loud, I've tried once or twice but it's too overwhelming and somehow it feels like saying it out loud will make it more real. Like something bad will happen if I even let it be acknowledged.

I guess I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this. I have trouble in general with the concept of aging, I guess - it freaks me out to see familiar actors looking older than I remember, to see family after some time and see that they've gotten older. I think it has something to do with things changing, which I know is part of autism... But the severity and persistence of this anxiety, about my dog specifically, is truly intolerable.

I want to try to talk to my psychiatrist about this, but I can't figure out how to put words to it without launching into in a huge monologue (like this ended up being) and then completely shutting down. I've thought of describing it as intrusive thoughts, because I've had those in the past (or at least that's what doctors called it) and they felt similar in nature. But that also feels almost... I don't know, not the whole picture?

How do I describe this overwhelming anxiety/preoccupation, that's seriously impacting my mental health and getting in the way of how I want to be living?";;;;
2025-10-23 11:12:22;Autism Evaluation;I just had an autism evaluation yesterday. I am a 26 year old female and I have consistently struggled throughout my life. I’ve carried many mental health labels since my childhood including: OCD, social anxiety, depression, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality, etc. None of them felt like they quite fit me. I had been on 20+ different medications since childhood. They either didn’t work or made things worse. It wasn’t until my newest therapist (that I’ve been with 10 months) taught me self-awareness that I had any idea of what was going on with me. I had little understanding of my internal experience or the things going on around me. I only knew sad, happy, anxious, angry and barely knew how to describe what it really was. My brother has been diagnosed with autism since age 3. It was never on my radar for myself because we seemed so different. It wasn’t until this therapist I’m seeing pointed out I had a lot of things going on that seemed to look like autism. (My therapist is autistic and ADHD herself). She started to show me how it showed up in girls and women and I was like OHHHH. I’ve been socially different since I can remember, felt like no one understood me, had very rigid routines, emotionally set off by changes, repetitive behaviors, trouble with loud noises and groups of people, food preferences/adversions, liked certain clothes, etc. I never put it all together because A. It shows up differently than my brother B. I wasn’t aware/attributed it to other things C. I kept my stuff mostly internalized D. I didn’t know what was normal or not… I just knew I felt quite different than others. But anyways, I am waiting for my appointment next week to go over the evaluation. I’ve been seeking help since I was a child, but never felt like I was getting anywhere. I’m hoping this is the answer and that I can finally understand myself. Any advice on what to do after this?;;;;

2025-10-23 10:30:22;What do you do when your performance evaluation at work is all about autism?;"Hello. I'm hoping someone may have some helpful insight for me. 

I learned that I'm autistic about 3.5 years ago, though later learned I was diagnosed at 2 and just never informed. Every job, internship, and report card in school has always given me the same feedback, and its all related to being autistic. I changed careers from social work to data analytics because its more aligned with my natural strengths, and the areas that I struggle in won't have as much of an impact on my role.

I've been at my current job for almost 2 years and have my first performance review tomorrow. When I started, I disclosed being AuDHD, talked about my strengths and challenges with it, how to expect my disability to show up at work, etc. I was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, told how my support needs were okay, none of it will be a problem, and how I'm perfect for the role. I was also recruited for this position and knew most of the staff before starting there. Throughout the past 2 years, I've received only positive feedback, told what an asset I am, how lucky they feel to have me there, all of the ways I bring value to the organization, etc. 

I did my self evaluation a few weeks ago, my supervisor sent me her evaluation today (I requested it 1 day in advance), and we have our conversation tomorrow. She wrote a lot of nice things about my performance, strengths, contributions, etc. She also spent the entire area about challenges and opportunities for growth basically saying I'm autistic and I need to not be autistic anymore. Just describing autistic traits and how they show up at work without acknowledging its autism. 

How do I tell them that I have already reached my full potential in those areas, I will always struggle, and that I need to know if the good outweighs the bad or if we will have a problem if I don't improve in the listed areas? I wholeheartedly agree that they are challenges, that's why its a disability. I don't want it to come off as I'm dodging accountability, making excuses, avoiding growth, etc. I want to grow, but in areas that I actually can. 

I can use tools, resources, create systems, be self aware, work through hard things by asking questions and accepting feedback, etc. I can't improve my ability to use context clues, draw conclusions, and interpret ambiguous information correctly. I can't use more nuanced thinking, read between the lines, and step away from black and white thinking. I can't help that I follow all of the rules as they are written and learn when to follow or break the rules. I'm 32, I've spent my entire life pouring everything I can into trying to improve those areas, and I've simply accepted now that its not going to change. When I stray away from what is clear, I fuck it up every time and will get in trouble for doing it wrong. 

Edit to add: Aplogies that this got long. I think I partially needed to vent because I'm so tired of the same thing over and over again. And I also just don't know what to say tomorrow about making plans on how I will improve in areas that I can't. ";;;;
2025-10-23 09:25:12;I don't like my Asperger;"I've had Asperger's since I was little; it was diagnosed around age 11. Now that I'm 20, I can't stand my life with these restrictions anymore. It's incredibly hard for me to express myself, and added to that, my support circle is nonexistent—I don't have a girlfriend or friends. And to my family, I'm the ""stupid autistic one,"" which really hurts. I wanted to ask how others manage this in their day-to-day lives. I know you have to accept it little by little, but I can't accept that I can't have what other people have. I want to be able to touch someone without being afraid. I want to receive a loving hug. I want my life to have meaning. I feel like I'm in a cage in my own body. I don't know why God made me this way, but I often feel like the best thing would be to disappear rather than be who I am. I wish I could be different";;;;
2025-10-23 05:54:18;Do any of you have difficulty speaking when you’re overstimulated and overwhelmed?;I’ve been recently diagnosed with ASD-1 and it feels like everyday I’m noticing things that point to the diagnosis. Today for example I went to get food and I was feeling overstimulated and overwhelmed and I got up to speak and I literally thought I wasn’t able to speak for a second and my speech just sounded off. The entire day I had felt overstimulated and just crappy so I just wanted to see if this is something others deal with?;;;;
2025-10-23 03:06:23;Overstimulation?;"So, I'm a teenage girl, I've gone to a psychiatrist once (so I could get sessions with a psychologist) and I only had like 6 or 7 sessions with the psychologist. I think I have already been diagnosed with anxiety but I hadn't been diagnosed with ADHD (it was one of the reasons I tried to get with a psychologist but that was two years ago and I haven't been able to keep going.) 

This has happened to me a couple of times and I'm not sure if it's overstimulation or if it's just me being stupid, but literally like twenty minutes ago I had gone to the kitchen to look for some cake my mom had made (she has a bakery and yesterday a cake had gone wrong, so anyone in the house could eat it) and when I couldn't find it she told me she had thrown it out cause it was raw. I immediately got upset, tears in my eyes and all that, she had a reasonable explanation and didn't do it out of malice but I left the kitchen genuinely anxious about it, hands fidgeting trying to find for anything to do, a need to scratch my skin since I've already done that before to soothe, jaw clenched too tightly. I kept crying for the full twenty minutes and I don't know if it's actually some form of overstimulation (I don't wanna self diagnose) or just me acting like a child about to throw a tantrum.";;;;
2025-10-23 02:53:39;"Are ""Accomplished"", Socially Articulate & Empathetic Autistics an Oxymoron? Is there an Autism Level 1/2? (sorry, long-winded)";"Since I was a kid I've been detrimentally affected by every little thing from a stray hair to the touch of clothing against my skin. In the 90's my mum assisted with ""special needs"" kids, and one day she told me about ""sensory overload"" which seemed to describe what I felt.

Over the years, the subject would return with people online calling out neurodivergent traits I share, or friends and therapists expressing suspicions about me.  I'm not big on labels and didn't want to ""appropriate"" a serious disorder so I dismissed these remarks, saying ""everyone's somewhere on the spectrum.""

But I'm now in my mid-forties and still struggling to become independent. I'm living with parents, never had a career, and am seeing my latest therapist both to address depression and anxiety, and to try and understand why I don't ""fit"" in society.  

This therapist tells me they work with a lot of autistic people, and urges me to get assessed.  Further, they raise the point that these issues have dictated my life choices.  Among other things, I'm extremely introverted and ""highly sensitive"" and can't tolerate fast-paced or sensory-intensive environments, long hours, or profit-driven drudge work. And it's not because I think I'm ""better"" than that; my failures contribute to a significant inferiority complex.
___

**Reasons I've told myself I can't be autistic**

A) I'm not always literal.  I like creative prose and allegory and metaphor and double entendres and sarcasm.  I enjoyed The Colbert Report.

B) I like novelty as well as routine.
I'm mostly a homebody who needs my own space to feel comfortable, but I do like to break routine sometimes and travel and have novel experiences that challenge me and build my confidence.

C) I am highly sensitive and deeply empathetic.
I'm hyper-tuned into body language and feel the feelings of those around me whether I want to or not. Even fictional representations of things affect me viscerally.

D) I have good social/interpersonal skills.
I had friends until age 11 when my family moved and I turned to my own interests.  I made internet friends who shared my interests after that, and eventually made another irl friend at age 33. 
___

**Greyareas**

While I like irony and creative prose, I read and process information fairly slowly, partly to work out intended meanings.  I also get very irritated when communication is imprecise, ambiguous, misleading, or tangential.  I can't understand talking just to be talking, rather than to convey information.  And sometimes I can't translate my thoughts into words at all.

Despite my occasionally intrepid expeditions, I also endure intense anxiety about the social, sensorial, and unpredictable or uncontrollable aspects of leaving the house, which I suppress with varying degrees of success, and get inordinately upset about small, unforeseen changes to things that I like or have incorporated into my daily routine, including in the digital landscape which I can spend weeks tailoring to my needs.

It's difficult to say whether my isolation growing up was voluntary or imposed, since I was both lonely and found socializing a waste of time.  I understand tone and expression and am good at performing the social dance despite my discomfort.  I've always mirrored people's faces instinctively, taking it as a cue for how I'm supposed to react in the moment when I don't have time to process.  My father would lose his temper with me if I got overexcited, amplified, or rambled, so I learned to contain those tendencies pretty early.

Since I was a child I've been in the habit of breaking down conversations word by word, both in text and in my head, to improve my understanding.  Of my myriad streams of competing thoughts at any given moment, one is always a rehearsal of anticipated conversations.

While I don't line things up, I'm highly organized and a chronic ""straightener"", impulsively fixing anything askew or disordered.
___

**Reasons I May Be Autistic**

* Sensory overload

I check all the boxes.  Visual, gustatory, olfactory, and especially tactile, interoception and auditory sensitivities are daily challenges.

* Stimming

I pace and flail my hands and arms if I get excited or agitated and am not actively suppressing the tendency.

* Non-verbal Communication and Silent meltdowns / Shutdown

The more overwhelmed I become, the less affect I have both in tone and expression and the less energy I have to translate my thoughts into verbal language.  I get increasingly monotone and mute and resort to more hand gesturing, and frequently have to withdraw.

* Special Interests?

I've mostly maintained the same interests since I was young.  Animation.  Comics.  Cats.  Reading.  Writing.  Research.  Websites.  

I find it virtually impossible to commit to things outside these interests or for purely monetary purposes, even though I desperately want to be independent.

* Sense of Justice

I have strong moral values which are not, I believe, influenced by external validation.

* I'm Trans

Apparently there's some overlap?

* Eye Contact

I find eye contact very intense and additionally can't stand *pictures* of people staring from websites, magazines, billboards, etc.

* Changing Tasks

My friend has described my work flow as having ""inertia"".  Once I start a task I don't like to switch or add more before I've finished the first.  I have intense difficulty beginning large projects but, once I've begun, don't like to be interrupted for anything, including bodily demands.

* ""Spiky skills"" profile

My ACT scores and college Disability department found that I scored above average in areas like verbal communication and below average in things like processing speed and maths.

* Sleep problems?

I developed the habit in my pre-teens of staying up while the household was asleep, and that hasn't changed, so if I have to keep a ""regular"" schedule or set an alarm I have issues.
___

**Clinical Assessment**

So, at my therapist's advice, I recently submitted to a formal assessment and, after a ~2.5 hour conversation, the psychologist concluded me ""not autistic"".  Although I had a lot of trepidation about a diagnosis, I felt unsettled.

The intake surveys, ABAS-3 and SRS-2, seemed to ask questions pertaining almost exclusively to children and severe cases, and the final analysis felt much the same.

She said that while I had the sensory stuff, a social communication deficit was the heart of an autistic diagnosis and not present.

**Reasons the psychologist told me I can't be autistic.**

A) I have good social/interpersonal skills.

> ""You're connected with people in a way that autistic people are not, because you care so much.  You're so sensitive, and so empathetic and mindful of kindness and reciprocation.  That is insight into emotions and relationships that people with autism struggle with.  You have good facial expressions, and you gesture to communicate. Your non-verbals are really good.  You pick up on humor, sarcasm and nuance.  You're interested in a way that people with autism lack.  There's no interpretation, no filter.""

B) I have a friend and *choose* solitude, rather than having it foisted upon me.

C) I have accomplishments.

It took me 7 years to complete 2 years of an undergraduate degree at community college.  I only managed it after submitting to an extensive 2 day assessment at the Disability department and receiving accommodations like extended time, reduced course load, and ""low-distraction"" test environments.  These followed me to university where I also applied to study abroad and completed my final year at a foreign institution with a *much* smaller class size and course load.

After completing my bachelors, I languished in low-level jobs and unemployment for 3 years before applying to a ""low-residency"" Masters, but because I was living with my parents I had to put it on hiatus since I couldn't sustain deep concentration in a shared household.

Still, I have earned a Bachelors, held short-term jobs, traveled fairly extensively and lived alone for extended periods.  Barring financial instability, I can take care of myself.

Ultimately the psychologist concluded: 
> ""There's sprinkings of both autism and adhd.  It's sort of this unspecified, pervasive, developmental disorder. You may fall in the neurodivergent category but not a specific diagnosis.  I think the mood-based stuff, the anxiety and depression, are very significant.""

She also said to understand Autism Level 1 I should look at representations of Aspergers in shows like ""Aspergers R Us"" or ""Aspergers in Love"", and that would show me that it's quite a different thing from what I have. (I couldn't find either.)
___

What bothers me, though, is the following:

* I know there are *accomplished* autistic people in all fields of work, including higher education.

* I've read that autistic people can be highly empathetic and more sensitive, rather than less.

* I've watched autistic people who seem to have excellent social communication skills.

* I've read that women are under-diagnosed because they present a different symptomology, including advantages in social intuition, and I spent the first half my life in that format (afab). 

So how do I square these things?  I've done the assessment and feel more lost and uncertain than ever.

**EDIT:**

Okay, this is a rare community that will read my verbose ramblings (and this post was truncated 🙄) and respond with such detail and understanding.  I am really finding a lot of resonance and support in these comments, and I deeply appreciate it. 

I still don't want to claim something I'm not but it's certainly clear that I'm not neurotypical, and having permission to acknowledge this from people who live it is probably more help than a clinical diagnosis.  

I'd still like to know the true nature of my condition but this gives me the encouragement that I needed to continue pursuing that.

Thank you, to each person here. ❤️";;;;
2025-10-23 01:30:53;Help, people see me as I doormat;"I've recently been diagnosed but I kind of knew since my son was diagnosed, he is my mini me.  I have been mimicking heavily since forever and actualy I've known this for years, I just didn't realize I was autistic and to what extend I've been doing it. Actualy I have no idea who I am otherwise. I mimick tone of voice, dynamics of conversation, laughter, and motion. They love it at the initial conversation because to them it's like talking to version of themselves in a way, and then when that runs out they just avoid me. I am very used to this drill.

When I can't mimick I am competely lost, I have no idea who I am, how to act, I am in lost infinitive space in social interactions. I am extremly good at clues though, I think. I see the smallest change in a person or their energy . 
So when I can't mimick I go into a panick mode, that makes me look extremly extremly subordinate, childish, with no self esteem, akward and like someone you can walk all over. I feel it, but can't stop. My job requires a person that shows assertivness. So I get mocked, they tell me how will YOU make them do xyz, (and I am not a manager or anything), and when I tell them it's their job to do this, it should't be based on how I walk into the room because I expect to work with adults,  they just laugh at me. I have similar issues in personal life.

How do behave like me when I don't know what that means? Ok therapy yes, I will. But any tips from this beautiful sub?";;;;
2025-10-23 01:19:18;AuDHD late Diagnosis Blog;Im a 35 year old, married, mother of two who recently just got into blogging. I am by no means trying to get rich. I simply wanted to find a spot to blog anonymously and share my life with others. The blog is free and I hope that it can help others to find commonalities, coping skills I'm learning, and just know that you aren't alone, and what is difference in us all is still remarkable. I worked previously as a manager for 10 years in customer service and I'm the youngest of 4 in my family. My daughter too has AuDHD and her diagnosis is how I found mine. I love God, but I am a sinner through and through so you'll find those stories in there as well. All I want to do with this is find out who I am with no mask, and be a help to someone else.

2025-10-23 00:36:54;not feeling human;"i've known for all of my life that i'm a very insufferably awkward person. it's hard for me to provide anything engaging or meaningful when talking to those i'm close with, let alone with strangers who want some quick small talk or a witty banter. there's not really a choice other than to accept this and let it alienate me, so that's what i've done. i don't have the spine or even really motivation to put myself out there and try to become more sociable. i know i'll just make the other person uncomfortable and i'll feel like shit for inconveniencing them.

i'm mostly comfortably where i am, meeting all of my friends through my others friends or extended friends of theirs. i'm lucky to be surrounded by good people who put up with me. i love all of them so much. but i notice all of them end up with a pretty similar perception of me: that my happiness and silliness is a byproduct of some sort of facade that i crafted. different people come up with different reasons for why i might've done that: to fit in, to avoid letting myself be vulnerable, or to be manipulative in some way i don't really understand.

it doesn't bug me that they think i'm being fake. it bugs me that it's not true. because, obviously, if this is such a regular conclusion for my friends to come to under completely different circumstances, that means that that's what should be the case.

one of my now ex-friends once told me that she struggles to see me as human. that because my face is unexpressive, because i went along with what she said and tried to match her energy, because i'd never cried in front of her or opened up about some deep, festering wound, i seem a lot more like an npc than an actual real, complicated person.

it was just a joke, i think. or at the very least some kind of off-hand comment. it wasn't that serious and it was a good year ago, now. but i've never been able to stop thinking about it. i really don't feel the full scale of human emotions, do i? people always talk about feeling so much that they can't process anything else. they say it spills out of them and that it's both a blessing and a curse. i see it among other asper girls, too, saying that their diagnosis actually makes them feel things far more vividly as compared to the stereotype of autistics being distant and cold.

she was right. in that sense, i'm not human at all. i don't think i even feel the full spectrum of human emotions and god that makes me sick. because i want to, i really really want to, i don't want to come across as fake and cold for existing no matter how genuine my happiness is. there's never been a time where i've broken down, completely inconsolable. there's never been a time where i'm so lovesick that i can't focus on anything other than how giddy i am that i talked to my crush. there's never been a time where i'm so angry with somebody that i can't stand to see their face. i can't even think of any more examples or use anything other than cliches to describe them.

i just wish that i wasn't so closed off. all i want to do is feel so much that my heart can't take it.";;;;
2025-10-22 23:53:53;Manager giving advice to someone struggling in early career;"I’m a young manager working in land use planning for a mid-sized city – a lot of work in social situations, highish pressure, bureaucratic culture, reading the room, social cues, technical but qualitative work. 16 or 17 months ago we hired someone as part of a cohort of recent masters grads out of school. I was his boss and soon in, it was kinda clear to me he may be neurodivergent and not well liked by the cohort. He tended to not read the room, communicate with incorrect words and inadvertently offend or turn people off. His work – mostly summarizing policy research - was pretty poor in quality, and often needed to be rewritten. He tended, for example, to have lots of spelling mistakes, jump to a conclusion or use archaic words that seemed out of place or included connotations that were not appropriate.

I was kind of an ok manager – I did weekly or biweekly checkins because I knew he was struggling. I was also under a lot of pressure and dealing with my own unrelated bullying situation so I had little depth to my ability to mentor. My personal style as a manager isn’t so great as I’m a bit of a people-pleaser. He wasn’t really doing so great and I was kinda coddling him and giving him low-stakes work, and generally saying he was doing ok. I wouldn’t for example delegate interacting with community members to him because I was worried he would say the wrong thing or jump to an inappropriate conclusion. The work I assigned to others in the cohort was obviously higher complexity. We had to have some disciplinary talks about something offensive he said on a group chat, and for falling asleep at his desk.

 He tried really hard to socially integrate but was not so well accepted. He was very engaged in asking for advice and planning out his career. He’s also from China and he attributes a lot of his negative experience to racism or English being a second language. There might be some of that, but I don’t really think the nastier perceptions he has of colleagues is true. I think it might be mild undiagnosed neurodivergence. There’s also cultural and family baggage for him around performing and being successful so he’s feeling a lot of pressure and depair because of his first career experience with my organization went badly. I think he drank copious amounts of coffee and worked extra hours. Sometimes his approach seemed kinda performative – celebrating the amount of work he did, or the complexity of the spreadsheet, but not quite “getting it.”

 Fast forward to 10 months into the role and his work and position transferred to another manager. He fell asleep at his desk again, continued with work that was in relatively poor shape. The new manager moved to fire him before his 12 month probation ended – pretty quick without much of a warning shot. She consulted with me and I probably wouldn’t have moved in the same way, but I agreed…our experience had been that he was dragging down the team. HR gave him a chance to say that sleeping at his desk was related to a medical condition but he didn’t say it was – he just said something like “I was bored”. The role was unionized but the union rep didn’t make an appearance.

 He’s got a lot of trust in me, and dislike for the manager that fired him. I don’t know if he ought to genuinely like me because I don’t know if I did him any favours. And he’s coming back for advice from me. In the 6 months since getting fired he’s had about 7 interviews in other organizations and they have all gone badly by the sound of it. He is attributing his lack of success to racism or nepotism, and saying to me that “I’ve realized supervisors like you are few and far between”. Not going to say nepotism and racism don’t exist in my sector, but I expect there are genuinely things he is saying in the interview that are turning people off. He may also be badly lying about getting fired in his last job as he is saying that “his term ended” but may be saying so awkwardly. Maybe just little things like grooming or body odor are important too. He’s getting to the point where the gap in his resume is hard on finances and looking bad.

 He’s considering totally abandoning the field. I think a deeper self-understanding or maybe undiagnosed neurodivergence could help, and less “fake it til you make it” struggling in areas that are not his strength. Our field is a lot of focus on interactions and politicking that I don’t think he’ll succeed at, but you can also get into more specialized technical work, which I think he might be good at. I’m grabbing coffee with him in a couple days to try and restore his confidence and give good advice.

 My questions:

* I’m not sure if my armchair diagnosis of being on the spectrum is right. Maybe he’s just not good with people/communication/analysis? Does the above thinking pan out from the experience of people who’ve faced career struggles from being on the spectrum?  
* He tends to be a bit bull-headed and doubt he’s ever considered the question.  Is there a good way to say to him “do you think you might be neurodivergent?” If that’s a yes, is there a good online resource I can point them to for self-assessing his strengths and weaknesses, especially from a career perspective.
* Is a field that’s relatively political like mine a good one to be in? Should he try and make this field work by finding a niche wihtin it or better to consider a bigger shift to something totally different? He's in his late 20s, so wanting to land himself. ";;;;
2025-10-22 23:17:08;What's your opinion about this type of article?;I'm a diagnosed autistic male (28) I'm very private about, only very few people in my close friends circle know.

The article only has a preview but to me was enough to know the author doesn't understand anything about autism and undermines the importance of seeking help or recognizing traits.;;;;
2025-10-22 23:11:56;How can I get diagnosed without spending thousands?;I’ll start by saying I live in Florida about an hour from Tampa on the west coast. I have been having a complete mental breakdown for the last few months trying to figure out how I am going to live an adult life. I am 27 F I have never worked we all know I am autistic it’s very clear my doctors and therapist agree but they can not diagnose it. The only place I’ve been able to find is on the other coast and wants 2k-2.5k to diagnose it. With no work and not being on disability at the moment (that’s a whole other story) I have no way of getting my diagnosis. Does anyone know of any non profit organization that can help me or any kind of resources of any kind? I’ve only found stuff for children it seems that once you reach 18 the world forgets you exist ;;;;
2025-10-22 22:02:57;Kissing feels strange but cuddling ok?;"Hello, me (21M) and my girlfriend (also 21) have been dating for a couple weeks now. I have been diagnosed with autism basically my whole life and she may be on the spectrum too or maybe just awkward. Side note this is both of our first relationships. 

Either way both of us really like physical contact but it’s been difficult for me to read her and know when is ok to hold her hand, give her a hug, etc. but I’m able to work on that. 

What I’m having more trouble with is kissing. Recently we tried kissing a bit more intensely but I started getting overwhelmed and had to back away for a bit. Is it normal to like cuddling but not be comfortable with kissing/making out? I tried looking it up but it seems most people group the 2 together which is unhelpful in my situation. Will this cause issues with progressing to other intimacy such as sexual acts? It seems like that’s the only way people tell each other to progress from my internet searches. Is it something I will get more used to as we do it more, or am I in trouble so to speak? Thanks ";;;;
2025-10-22 22:02:55;Reagan closing all the institutions ironically was the best thing for Neurodivergent awareness in America;"I got to thinking about how in the 80s Ronald Reagan closed down so many mental institutions and failed to provide adequate replacement, and this is an absolutely terrible thing for sure, but ironically this has backfired.

 Ever since then the pool of available people to clarify and refine various diagnosis is much larger now not just because of those who would be in a mental institution in those beforetimes, but the stigma around it has slowly but surely been dulling as more and more families are being forced to reckon with their empathy issues towards those who are neurodivergent.

Before the fear of mental institutions and insane asylums made the masking of so many of the slightly better functioning ones reach maximum levels, and that leads to bitterness and burnout that produces trauma on their children, feeding into the vicious cycle.

Am I wrong for thinking this?

 Would Autism, ADHD, and other Neurodivergent research be conducted and funded just as much if the mental institutions of yeateryear still existed? And if so, would it be more along the lines of pseudoscience that ""other"" us as if we were alien curiosities?";;;;
2025-10-22 20:11:06;Is this a common experience ?;As I’ve gotten older I’ve gotten very angry. I realized there’s a pattern where people would dislike me for no reason and get horrible treatment. For example, I’ve had some people that either start out as close or great friends and they turn out to be horrible. Sometimes it could be the other way around because they could start off as bad friends and progress into good friends. It gives off the message that there was a point that I’ve never had a friend that didn’t screw me over. This happened for as a long as I could remember. I’ve always known that I was different and people look at me as if there’s something wrong with me and insult me for my intellect. This is despite minding my own business. I’ve been treated badly from friends, family to strangers. Sometimes I thinks I’m autistic because I heard that this is common experience where people dislike you for no reason when it’s because your autistic and they don’t know about it. I’m just so angry because how com everyone could stand up for themselves but I can’t ? This made me very depressed since I was a kid and I never know the right things to say to stand up for myself. I wish my life was different . There were times where I could walk into a room and everyone didn’t like me or made assumptions about me. I haven’t been diagnosed or anything but I just want friends that never had to treat me like shit or let things slide for us to be friends.;;;;

2025-10-22 13:29:42;Need help (autism and adhd related);"Hi I need help from someone else’s perspective, I’ve come as a last ditch effort and I want to know if what’s going on is normal. 

Recently I’ve been having problems with studying and focusing on certain things (I know it’s sounds like I’m gonna be over dramatic but I don’t know how else to explain) I literally cannot focus on studying for homework or test or anything. I cannot physically focus without being inside the school or a library. Any time I try to make myself focus somewhere else I cannot without getting distracted by something else. 

I’ve also been have problems for a few months now where I go temporarily non verbal. I’ve tried speaking whenever it has happened to me but whenever I try to speak. The words don’t physically come out and whenever I try to speak again only 3-1 words come out. It has made my life difficult due to it happening at random times. It could be while I’m outside, with friends, family, etc. And whenever I do speak it usually makes it more difficult for whoever I’m with. And the situation becomes worse. 

The reason why I say that the post is autism related is because I am currently trying to get a diagnosis for autism and adhd related issues and I just want to know if anything I have stated happens to someone regular.

(I do want to apologize in advance that if what I have said just sounds like it’s just me being over dramatic but I’m genuinely asking for help. | Also I have not said all the issues that I’ve had but these are the main ones that I can think of currently)";;;;
2025-10-22 08:27:37;in my 40s with Asperger’s - still failing at life.;"Diagnosed in my teen years with Asperger’s, was in denial of it for so long, was too busy pretending to be someone different, so i would fit in.

Relationships failed, friendships never lasted, jobs never seemed to last long enough to get comfortable.

Somehow eventually managed to find the one i would marry, we have a child, i never thought that would happen, thank god for my child, giving me a reason to stay in this confusing world.

Happiness short lived, we had our issues for sure, but i didn't think she would cheat, divorce obviously, this situation puts me in a dark place, miserable with my life, needing medication so i don't just bed rot.

Now im in my 40's, still struggling, still staying as clear from human contact as i can, only one person i would call friend. 

I just lost another job (no feedback as to why), am too embarrassed to tell my family.  

I dont fit in anywhere, i thought i was doing well there, i was as always, wrong.

My life is a mess, and a roller coaster, i guess im getting back on to find yet another job, hopefully before anyone finds out.";;;;
2025-10-22 07:19:44;is it ok that my psychiatrist prescribed me adderall without an ADHD diagnosis?;"Today I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist. My therapist recommended I go see one because of issues related to focus, working memory, and trouble keeping up with assignments in school. However, we met for 10 minutes out of the 60 minute time slot (which was a lot quicker than I was expecting), and he prescribed me adderall. I do not have an ADHD diagnosis and thought that one was required to be prescribed a medication like adderall. Also, I suspect that my issues in school are related to a learning disability as I do not think I meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD.
Was it fine for him to prescribe adderall? I don't think I take it because I don't feel comfortable after less than 10 minutes of talking to him but I wanted to see what other people think.";;;;

The girl I'm dating in an understanding person and loves me dearly, but, like with anyone, people can have pre-conceptions around autism and I have anxieties that it'll permanently change the lens that my girlfriend looks at me through (perceptions of herself from others, thinking that I can't empathise with her, infantilising / parenting me, thinking that I won't be able to understand if she's joking, feeling as if she doesn't know how to help if I'm in a low mood, (jumping ahead) does she want her kid to potentially have autism, what will this look like if we live together; in-general feeling distanced and if she'll never truly be able to understand / connect with me).

Her therapist brought up the idea that she may have ADHD, and I spoke privately to her best friend who has known her for years (who has multiple people with ADHD within her family) and she reckoned she could well have ADHD. The psychologist made the point that I should reflect on the fact that this doesn't push me away from my girlfriend and perhaps I should give myself the grace of expecting this for myself. 

She also has a best friend with autism (different friend) and another best friend has two brothers with autism with high support needs. She also has friends at university with autism. This all bodes well for me, but I wonder if it changes in regards to a romantic relationship. 

She does make the occasional joke about the way we're dancing being 'autistic' etc, but I've joined in in the past, but I think that just comes with the age we are (26/24) and the memes we grew up with. One time she did say 'oh he's so on the spectrum' as an insult, which I did find upsetting and makes me apprehensive about talking about it. She also made a joke the other day saying 'having you ever been tested for something' - I'm high masking and get these jokes a lot because I don't think anyone suspects it, and have had people laugh it off when I've brought it up in the past - I think in her case, she only jokes about it as it seems an absurd reality.

I understand that a lot of these things are potentially projecting what the psychologist referred to as perhaps 'my own internalised ableism', as perhaps a few years ago I wonder if I would've had the dating preference of wanting to date someone of (what I thought was) my own neuro-type, which I think, in all honesty, is fair, if you haven't done the research into it. 

Considering the infantility of the relationship in the scheme of things, I wonder if now is the time to tell her. She's only really now starting to see the shutdown moods I get into where all I can muster up a is whisper and this has even made her cry on occasions but I think she just thinks it's depression (which sometimes it is unfortunately) and is upset because she doesn't know how to help, so I think it could help here - or just give her enough reason to realise that this is too taxing for her this early into a relationship. We're arguably in a bit of a rough patch due to various other reasons so wondering if it'd be too much of a catalyst. I worry that if we do extended periods together I won't be able to continue masking a few days in. Having said this, she's at university in a different city, so until June I won't really be seeing her for extended periods, only weekends.

I just wondered if anyone here has opted to keep it to themselves / waited to tell their partner after receiving diagnosis and this ended up being the right thing to do. I wonder if I wait until she gets back from university to tell her, as I'll start to see her much more regularly and it may end up putting too much pressure on the relationship if she doesn't understand when that time comes.

She's only really now starting to see the shutdown moods I get into where all I can muster up a is whisper and this has even made her cry on occasions but I think she just thinks it's depression (which sometimes it is unfortunately) and is upset because she doesn't know how to help, so I think it could help here - or just give her enough reason to realise that this is too taxing for her this early into a relationship. We're arguably in a bit of a rough patch due to various other reasons so wondering if it'd be too much of a catalyst. I worry that if we do extended periods together I won't be able to continue masking a few days in. Having said this, she's at university in a different city, so until June I won't really be seeing her for extended periods, only weekends.

I just wondered if anyone here has opted to keep it to themselves / waited to tell their partner after receiving diagnosis and this ended up being the right thing to do. I wonder if I wait until she gets back from university to tell her, as I'll start to see her much more regularly and it may end up putting too much pressure on the relationship if she doesn't understand when that time comes.

2025-10-22 00:53:57;ND Friends and Socializing;"I met with a few friends from high school the other week. It had been about 5 years since I had seen them and about 20 plus years since high school.

I mainly wanted to see ONE friend who was visiting from out of town. But, he had invited a group of people. I knew ALL of them but I just do not do well in groups. It was at a crowded restaurant.

Now to give some background, the friend from out of town is ASD. Diagnosed, and no question about it. His new wife was there and his brother was there. Also two other friends who are both ADHD.

So, a diverse ND bunch. However, just like in high school, I was mostly mute while everyone was conversing and having a good time.

I'd try to come up with something to say but the topic would change so quickly that it wouldn't make sense. I started to get stressed and so I fell back to my usual coping mechanism which is counting. I started counting the ceiling tiles and light fixtures around the room.

However, I was called our for 'zoning out,' and they tried to bring me back into the conversation. My ASD friend, started asking me questions directly at me. Which I appreciated, and I answered. I then tried to expand and it would go back and forth for awhile it but then the group topic would change and I'd be lost again.

Thankfully, my friend recognized it and we had another get together with just him and his wife. I chose the location, a restaurant I was familiar with, and we ate out on the patio at lunch time so it was empty and quiet.

 I just get so frustrated though. Here I am another member of a ND group of people and I am the only one really visibly struggling to even socialize like this. Everyone else was having a great time. 

I don't get it. I can't do groups. I can't do loud chaotic environments. I can't follow fast paced conversation. They all can without issue.";;;;
2025-10-21 23:55:23;Does anyone else on the spectrum feel like they have no specific interests at all?;"Hi everyone, I hope you’re doing well.  I’m (28f)I’ve been diagnosed with ASD at 27 due a huge break down.I have almost all the symptoms except one: I don’t have any specific interests.

Since I was young, I’ve never really liked anything. I experience extreme boredom, and the older I get, the worse it becomes. I just lose interest in everything. For example, if I have nothing to do during the day, I’ll just scroll on my phone.

I know a bit about many topics, but only on a very superficial level ,just enough to blend in and be able to talk with people. I’ve never been truly passionate about studying, working, or anything in particular.

For context, I have a Master’s degree in Business Management and Strategy, but I only did it because it’s what everyone around me was doing. I learned to cook not because I enjoy it, but just to fit in. I even learn new vocabulary just to give a certain image 
The only thing that I like is relaxing like sleeping eating having massage, ocean, amusement park and thrill attraction 

Honestly, I feel empty inside.
Has anyone else with ASD experienced something similar?

2025-10-21 23:54:52;Motherhood?;"Hi, I'm not sure I'm autistic but I am getting an assessment next month. I'm really struggling with motherhood and I'm wondering if I am autistic because of my struggles. I am interested to see if anyone has had similar experiences and if autism might explain my experiences? Or any adivce? I have been diagnosed with PPA, PPD and CPTSD which could all explain my feelings too.

I have a 2.5 yr old.

1. I couldn't understand him as a baby. I could read two states - screaming or not screaming. Now that he's talking an has a wider range of emotions and expressions it is easier for me.

2. I was in a state of constant hyperarrousal/ anxiety until I started using earplugs when he was 2. Now I am not contantly in a state of hyperarrousal.

3. His screaming sent me right into flight or fight - partially can be explained by the fact my Dad would scream a lot at me and my sister while trapping us (hense the CPTSD diagnosis). Earplugs are the cure.

4. Breastfeeding was horrible - I couldn't stand the sensations. Pumping was so overstimulating -made me want to scream and rip the machine off. I had to hand pump so I could control the motion. While breastfeeding I had to read or watch TV or else I would want to rip of my son and scream. I still breastfed 20 months because the Doctors said it was best to breastfeed until at least 1 and I need to follow the rules. Then it took some time to wean him.

5. Before he was born I was drawing a lot. It felt like drawing put my brain back together and made me feel whole. When he was born I couldn't draw - I had to care for him and hold him. I couldn't draw when he napped. I thought I would be able to. He didn't nap in a bassinet - I had to stroller nap him or contact nap. I was devistated to not be able to draw. I felt crazy - I just wanted to draw and still do. Is that special interest?

6. I have a hard time at mom groups because I don't want to talk about babies. I want to talk about deep conversations - like the state of the world or my career passion - history. 

7. Not having a schedule, or not being in control of the schedule felt devastating. 

8. For a long time he screamed if I left the room - feeling like if I had any independent movement or thought would result in being screamed at was psychologically excruciating - not just like annoying or something but devastaing.

9. I still don't feel like I really know how to interact with him and I'm just playing a role of what I think a mother should be and acting out things I read in books or behaviors I think good moms should do.

Before I had my son I always had trouble making friends - feeling like I needed to make up a personality or what not, feeling like I needed an instruction manual. Always happiest alone with my art, reading, writing or with nature. Needed lots of downtime. Happy if my husband was around doing his own thing too.

Just looking for answers - some help being compassionate for myself and giving myself permission to take space and do what I need to do to be a good mom. Thank you.";;;;
2025-10-21 22:06:48;Burnout recovery;"Hi, some context first… I’ve been diagnosed autistic for 8 years, I’m currently on the waitlist for ADHD assessment. Ive also struggled with mental illness for most of my life and been inpatient twice due to suicide attempts.

I was severely depressed from the end of last year until late this summer and burnout hit at some point near the start of this year. I had two part time jobs last year then went interrailing for 3 weeks before the depression and burnout began. I left one before travelling and the other this summer.

Since the depressive episode ended I’ve wanted to focus all my energy on burnout recovery since it meant moving in with my parents part time to function. Although they both work full time (between the home and office) so they can only help out so much. Mainly having food in the house for me to eat, most of the time making and bringing me the food too. I’ve managed to get back to dance, driving lessons and therapy. I’ve also prioritised socialising with friends, sometimes going out but also more movie nights in since leaving the house takes a lot out of me.

I also got a dog at the start of the year to help with my mental health which has been working but it’s also put even more on my plate. My mum has been great at helping out with the dog but when she’s at work my dad doesn’t help much and I can’t usually get out of bed until after lunch which means she can go without care all morning which has led to later feeding times and accidents around the house.

Since I’m taking recovery more seriously now I’m seeing areas in my life where I may need more support if I want to recover. For example I don’t have anyone helping me take meds and I can’t remember if I’m taking them or not. It’s 3pm now and I haven’t eaten yet today because I prioritised having my weekly bath (the most I can manage recently) so I’m not a mess at dance tonight. I could use more help with cleaning and obviously need more help taking care of my dog.

We had talked about me finding a house closer to them since I have to stay in my flat at least one or two nights a week with no support and I haven’t had more than a wrap for lunch and milk in my fridge for months. I’m starting to consider if I’d be better in a supported living facility, we had discussed finding someone to just call round to help once or twice a week with cleaning etc but I don’t know if it’s enough and after being so “high functioning” it’s hard to admit how much I’m struggling now. It’s even hard getting out of bed and brushing my teeth. Some days all I can manage is moving from bed to the sofa and eating whatever is put in front of me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated 💕";;;;
2025-10-21 21:51:46;I’ve took the steps towards getting an Adult Autism Assessment;"I’ve noticed some traits that seems a little consistent with autism and I thought I’d say hello (hello👋) and talk a little about them.
I have a sensory sensitivity issue with wooden cutlery. I also can’t touch anything wet after cutting my nails for 3 days as it makes me feel uncomfortable.
I avoid eye contact and social interactions because I do feel a little overwhelmed, which has left me really happy to be at home and unhappy when I have to leave the house.
I rehearse almost every conversation in my head before having them because I feel it’ll be less unpredictable when I actually do engage with someone, and when I do talk to someone it’s always awkward and tiring. 
And I also hyper fixate on a new hobby for a small period of time before feeling overwhelmed by it all and then stop it all together.

My husband thinks I have ADHD and adult autism and has suggested I get an assessment.
I’m a little nervous but more excited because being diagnosed will explain A LOT and help me navigate through life with a little more self-awareness.

I guess I’m writing this as I’d like some advice.
I don’t know what about or how.
It’s confusing.";;;;
2025-10-21 16:23:44;Uncommon autism traits?;"Hi, I'm new to this. My first post here, and I created a new Reddit account to keep this separate from my main account because reasons. 

My journey started a few years ago when I read the book Neurotribes, and I've since read a fair amount about autism and I'm finding a lot of things about the way I act that fit the description. I'm a man in my 60s, in the UK, and I'm not sure yet if I want to go through the trouble of getting a firm diagnosis, because it seems to be a hassle. 

Aside from the common traits and symptoms of autism, I've found some surprising things in my research. I'm curious how common these are.

Scoliosis: I have a slight scoliosis, and one article I read said that 1/4 to 1/3 of males with scoliosis show signs of autism.

Amblyopia: This was first spotted when I was six years old, and wasn't correctable (though it might have been corrected if there had been an operation to correct the strabismus which was the cause). There seems to be a fairly strong correlation between people with amblyopia and autism.

Aphantasia: I learned about this a bit more than a year ago, after reading an article on a novelist's website about it. (See this Wikipedia article for more on aphantasia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) This is definitely something that I experienced, and it, too, correlates with autism. 

I'm curious of the three things above are commonly discussed. I didn't see them in books about autism, but since they are all traits or conditions that I have, I looked them up individually.

2025-10-21 15:19:31;Astenoneurotic syndrome is hard:(;"Hi. M16. I was diagnosed by a neurologist last week. Residual damage to the central nervous system, in the form of astenoneurotic syndrome. 
I am severely struggling with my life at this point. I get barely 5-4 hours of sleep every night, while also having constant nightmares. I stutter a lot, my speech, in general, is not great, and I have severe memory loss, which really messed me up. 
It all started when I was 15. I was working for my father, in his auto shop, at summer. And I started huffing brake cleaner. It went on for almost half a year. My parents caught me in late January. I stopped since then, bit withdrawal... Oh god the withdrawal. 
I started losing my memory, in waves. One day I would remember pretty much everything, and the next day-poof, and I'm like a clean sheet of paper. It wasn't rare for me to forget my name, my school, my parents, and I always found things out through my ID and other documents when no one was home. And now, being ten months clean, I got a diagnosis. And after doing some research on it, I found out that yeah. It fits me pretty well.
And I thought that the diagnosis would make my relationship with my father better, but nah. He only started seeing me as a ""junkie"" and he keeps saying ""once a druggie, always a druggie"", even though I'm almost a year clean. 
All that being said, I would really want to see how you guys understand what you feel. Like, emotions, how your stomach feels, what the feeling is called when everything is too much, when I'm about to pass out, but at the same time too energised to lay down. 
I hope you're all having a good day 
Please care for yourselves first.";;;;
2025-10-21 13:55:45;Neurodivervence and dementia/similar?;"My dad is highly likely AuDHD and is 70 years old.

However, within the last year my siblings, mom, and myself have noticed symptoms such as memory, concentration, mild problem solving difficulties with things hes always been good at, poorer navigation sense, more emotion regulation challenges with frustration, and other things that while they're often associated with AuDHD they have been getting more frequent issues in slightly different ways. These are also early cognitive decline and early dementia symptoms. Hes started calling my brother (and me at times) 30 minutes apart for the same questions or same discussions, becoming worried about mom in odd ways, and struggling more with orientation while driving which he'd always been good at, among others. My mom and brother live in the same city as him so see the day to day frequency and specifics more. I noticed these things also but I live far away and dont see day to day much. I just chalked them up to his neurodivergence as lots of the things they initially mentioned without explanation really just sounded like my ADHD and in ways. After talking to mom and brother it seems like its different than typical what they're seeing in the more day to day context and hes not managing his other health conditions as well which could be very serious in the future.

I'm worried things are starting to shift towards some form of cognitive impairment like dementia or similar. I cant find any research about risk/tendency, or how it presents in neurodivergent people. While we're not worried about safety Issues or ability to care for self yet it is still different and slowly impacting more.. i dont know how to help. 
For those of you with parents or partners who've had similar patterns as they age or had these diagnosis.. what did the early things look like, and what did you do to support them and yourself? 
Again I dont 100% know, but its been a slow progression and my brother doesn't bring things up unless he notices things prominently. I just need some insight, emotional support, and advice if possible.. ";;;;
2025-10-21 08:11:14;Need relationship advice;"My (m) boyfriend and I (m)  are both very high functioning adults with autism, but he's younger and isn't very self aware about what his autism means. We've been together over 2 years. 

He has major issues with demand avoidance which are impacting seriously on our happiness together. I've been unintentionally making him feel like I'm overwhelming him and for example he can become extremely triggered if I ask him to to do some chores around the house. 

He wants very regular physical intimacy and wants me to always initiate, but then if I do it in a ""wrong way"" or too often he has a meltdown. 

His overload response is to isolate, avoid interaction, withdraw and block me for sometimes over a month after packing his things hastily then flying back home asap. 

When he cones back we have a 5 minute pragmatic rules settling session then agree to not discuss our emotions because he says he's finds it frustrating and he can't do it. I accept and love that part of him, because I know he loves me and wants to be with me forever, he says, when calm and relaxed.  

He makes me feel so special when he makes me feel loved in his own way, almost always subtle and non verbal.  

But any time he gets triggered (ridiculously trivial things) he feels in that moment that he wants nothing more to do with me.  

He just came back home tonight after subjecting me to  3 weeks of hell he put me through by virtually ignoring me and telling me he doesn't want to talk to me. But suddenly, now he's back, he's acting more loving and affectionate than usual.  

I'm feeling very damaged. I'm like skittle just standing there and I'm at his mercy, and will suffer horrendous emotional pain when he gets angry and leaves me again.  

I don't know how to start the conversation to explore if he's feeling the confusion about these love-hate cycles. And how we can build a safe space in our relationship. 

I am willing to live with him and give him the love and sex he wants. I love that he's neuro atypical and I love the way we love each other in such an  unusual way. Mostly it works for both of us. 

But how do I help him to understand that I'm happy for him to keep control and never feel compelled to do anything I ask. All I need is for him to be honest and direct. Instead he retreats and keeps building up micro frustrations, then gets overwhelmed and leaves fast.  

I never pick up on the fact that he's getting  annoyed with me because of my own place on the spectrum. So when he leaves me it comes as a complete shock, out of nowhere, and shatters my world and I suffer terribly.  

I don't understand why he wants me to be loving and physical with him. But then suddenly decides that I've somehow done something in a bad way . he's unable to tell me the reasons, just withdraws and refuses to talk. 

He refuses to try any form of counseling but I think I need to prioritise getting him fully diagnosed by a professional because then they can help him develop insight into why he feels those bad feelings.

Any advice or comments welcome, please 🙏 🫶 ";;;;

2025-10-21 03:17:59;No sense of identity with AUDHD;"I’m (19F) who was diagnosed autistic super young, then growing up my ADHD became super prevalent. 

I always found that my ADHD was always “stronger” (maybe I became really good at masking my autism) but I personally was never medicated for my ADHD until recently. 

I somewhat always relied on my ADHD side for making friends as I was bubbly and social but really masked myself, using my hyperactivity and type-b personality to make friends. 

I also found that since I was conventionally attractive, people found that I was quirky and interesting rather than weird which unfortunately helped me a lot as well. 

I recently started medicating for ADHD and I realized my character traits I relied on so heavily are now all gone and I have no sense of an identity or personality. I was starting university and wanted to be able to work efficiently and it’s certainly helped in every sense of my life in productivity, I feel like a robot or an empty shell.

2025-10-21 00:23:37;Need Guidance: Daughter With Seizure History, Possible ADHD/Autism, and School Struggles;"So my daughter had meningitis when she was 3 which caused her to have seizures. She’s 10 right now & had been on seizure medicine since. She only has the focal absence type seizures & I rarely ever seen her having them. The only time she ever has one it’s caused by being sick or running too much while playing outside. She was off of it for about a year with ok from her doctor but then she got strep & it caused her to have one so we put her back on the medicine permanently. 

She’s always had trouble with her memory & attention span. Her grades are progressively getting worser every year. That one year we took her off her medicine her teacher did say she seemed like she was paying attention a little better,her memory was better, & her grades did improve some. Then when we put her back on her grades kept getting bad again. Her worst subject is math.

 I brought up the memory attention issue & the trouble with grades with her neurologist. I’m not sure if the memory attention issues are something that is permanently caused from when she had meningitis, if it’s a side effect from her medicine, or if she has adhd, autism, or some kind of learning disability. She suggested I get her a 504 plan & maybe evaluated. I got the 504 plan for her seizures  finally right when last school year ended. It didn’t go into effect until this school year but she’s still struggling with it. She has extra test time. So I had the evaluation done in September…

The psychotherapist says she’s seeing signs of autism & maybe adhd. She was saying my daughter had a flat affect with her face & her voice is pretty monotone. My daughter is bluntly honest sometimes at inappropriate times & also takes things literally. I’m not surprised that the psychotherapist sees signs of autism because I’m autistic & been officially diagnosed since I was 3 or 4. I’m not officially diagnosed adhd but I pretty sure I have that also. She reminds me of me at her age. The psychotherapist said that they were going to do further testing because they don’t want her to fall under the radar since girls often go undiagnosed. Then she sent home a checklist for symptoms for her teacher this year & her teacher last year. Has anybody else had a similar experience with their child as an autistic parent with the epilepsy, memory problems, & possible autism/adhd. 

What should I do? Or what else can I do to help her? I’m trying my best to help her any way I can. She starts middle school next year & middle school was the worst for me in regards to bullying & the school work is only going to get harder. I don’t want her to fall behind in school & struggle anymore than already is. Any advice is much appreciated. ";;;;

2025-10-20 20:16:52;I don’t like to “use things up”;"I’m not asking if I’m autistic; I already know I am. I have several oddities that I can only assume is related to autism. 

One of my weird behaviors is buying something and never using it. It’s not because I forget to use it. It’s more like if I do use it, it won’t be in brand new condition…I guess. I still haven’t put my finger on the real cause of this behavior (and I’m not asking for diagnosis…just wondering if anyone relates to this).

So for instance, I buy a pad of paper to draw on. But I never use the paper. I want to use it; it’s why I bought it. But I don’t use it. 

Some of the other items I buy and don’t use are: puzzle books, crayons, markers, paint, Xacto blades, razor blades, post-it notes, pressure point ear seeds, and certain snacks and treats (that become too stale or outdated to enjoy).  

I also buy two of everything, so I have a spare; and sometimes I buy a spare for a spare. But in these cases, I use the items. 

The first time I did this was at the end of the year in first grade, when the teacher gave me a math workbook to take home with me and practice during the summer.  The pictures were so crisp and colorful. I didn’t want to mark up the book, so I never wrote in it. Other incidents were hickory nuts o gathered during recess and didn’t want to eat them because they would be gone. A bunch of colorful strips of paper bound together for notes (before post-its were invented) that my grandmother gave me, a carton of chalk as a Christmas gift in 4th grade. My mom threw all that stuff away. 

Does anyone else relate to this “consuming phobia”, or whatever it is?  I’m just curious. Thanks!";;;;
2025-10-20 16:18:03;Does it actually matter if I get formally diagnosed with autism?;"You can read my previous post on here where I write about how I think I have what was Aspergers Syndrome. I spend about 95 - 97% of my time alone. I don't drive. I don't have a support system. Despite those challenges, I'm able to take care of myself and be an independent homeowner.

I'm an Army veteran who served for 6 years. I receive VA disability for MDD with anxiety. It's enough for me to live on. I get almost all of my medical and dental treatment from the VA. My VA disability benefits and health care benefits are supposed to be for the rest of my life (barring political changes).

I don't see any benefit to getting a formal autism diagnosis. There's no medication for autism. There's very few accommodations available for me even if I did get formally diagnosed with level 1 autism. I don't work because my VA benefits are enough for me to live on. It makes me very uncomfortable how RFK Jr & Trump keep talking about autism in public as if it's a disease that needs to be cured.

I saw a mental health professional a couple months ago. He asked me if I wanted to get tested for autism. I told him no. I feel confident in that I have what was Aspergers Syndrome or high functioning autism. It doesn't really matter to me if it's official. But part of me wonders if it matters or if an official autism diagnosis would benefit me in some way that I haven't thought of.";;;;
2025-10-20 13:59:23;Masking, dating help;Never making myself vulnerable again. I am mid 50s, female, in shape and attractive which has caused me more problems because people just look at the outside and just don't understand me.  I was and am still convinced my old roommate was a perfect match for me. We had so many things in common and while it was never said out loud I believe he is on the spectrum as well. We maybe had 5 or 6 very long , wonderful conversations but that was a years time. He stayed to himself and I was trying to draw him out, but at the same time I am all over the place because I don't know how to act or what to say.  Anyways I told him liked him the day I moved out. He was responsive but it quickly went South because I couldn't communicate.  How are 2 people with Asperger's ever going to have a relationship?? It's a never ending wheel. Plus I don't think he knows of my diagnosis and I am pretty sure he doesn't think I know of his. It was very obvious to me in him, but I masked until I couldn't. Sorry this is so long. It's very frustrating.;;;;
2025-10-20 13:58:58;I feel there was glaring evidence of my Autism that was missed in my childhood;"45F here. Not officially diagnosed by clinical assessment, but I know I am on spectrum, and few people have pointed this out. It all fits. 

Now when I look back, all these signs were so obvious and I feel grief that it went missed and perhaps my life could have been better if I was treated as autistic instead of a weirdo. 

1. I spoke very late, they thought I was mute. After I started speaking, I became very talkative, even now I shift between the two. 

2. Sucked two fingers (middle and ring finger) till I was 12 - every night and every time I was distressed. Attempts to stop it only increased it.

3. I couldn't look at people's face. I always looked down or side ways. Now I look at face but difficult to look into eyes. 

4. Bullied by everyone including peers, siblings, cousins and relatives. Always felt odd and out of place and never belonged. Tried so hard to be ""normal"" and accepted, but failed. .Never really had true friends. I tried hard and always got taken advantage of.

5. Special interests in animals and excessive reading. I played by self and read a lot of  books instead of socialising. Even now I find group interaction so tough. 

6. Acting out, temper tantrums. I was a difficult child I think. But I am calm now.

7. Cannot try new food. Resistant to change. Even now I struggle with that. 

8. Hated loud sounds. During Diwali my mother had to lock me up in a room because of my extreme reaction to crackers sound, and also to protect me from cousins who deliberately burst loud crackers to upset me. I still have startle response to loud sounds, crackers and thunder. 


9. Extreme attachment to animals instead of humans. I was in farm and had a row of cats, dogs and chickens following me. My mother had to give many away because of nuisance I caused by getting them inside and sleeping with them. And everytime a chicken was caught to be slaughtered, I would be howling, trying to free them and I had to be locked up again. I still love animals so much. 

10. I am a stickler for rules and cleanliness. 

There were so many signs. I just listed few. I wish it was known then and my family could have loved and accepted me better than trying to get rid of me as a misfit. ";;;;
2025-10-20 13:35:29;My evaluation was negative, but I have some serious doubts.;"I already posted this on r/ADHD, but it just doesn't get any views. But it's not uncommon for adhd to co-occur with asperger's, so I figured I might as well post it here. And I already have an asperger's diagnosis, so there's that.

I was recently evaluated for adhd by a psychologist. She came to the conclusion that I definitely don't have it, but I find that very hard to believe. But I think I know what made her reach that conclusion.

I had to bring my old school reports. I read through them before handing them over to her, and I was shocked at just how inaccurate they are. They constantly refer to me as still and attentive, but only the former point is true. I was barely paying attention to anything in school and was daydreaming constantly. The only reason I did so well was because I was already very knowledgable of most subjects from sources outside of school.

They also say I'm well-organized, but that was only because my mother always made sure I had everything I needed, and always made me start homework as soon as possible.

My mother had to fill out a question sheet. I was not allowed to view it, but my mother actually talked to me about several of the questions and how she answered. And it's obvious that she has a VERY wrong idea about my living situation and my struggles. Probably because we barely interact with each other, despite living in the same house.

I mentioned my worries about the inaccuracies in the school reports and the question sheet to the psychologist, but I'm honestly not sure if she really took my concerns into account.

She also said one of the main reasons she ruled out adhd was because I show no signs of physical hyperactivity or impulsivity. That makes me believe that she was more focused on the symptoms of the hyperactive type of adhd, not the inattentive type, which I suspect I have.

I'm still convinced I have inattentive adhd. All the daydreaming, the forgetfulness, the problems with starting or finishing so many things, the voices in my head that just never go quiet. It just has to be more than just asperger's.

What do you guys think? Should I get a second opinion?";;;;
2025-10-20 11:16:03;Looking for some reassurance/personal experience stories...;"Like many, I was never diagnosed growing up as a female for ocd, adhd, depression, anxiety, or autism. It was a very, 'you'll pull through champ, this is just a face, toughen up' rhetoric.

Im ftm, late 20s have had the same therapist who works really well with me for five years and im only now really dropping masking, learning to be myself, navigate social relationships that were fundamentally built upon me masking all of the above to not be bullied or abused and for the comfort of others. Again, being raised as a female in a very religiously homogenous red state and not a part of that culture, there's a lot of weight on you without adding mental illnesses being compounded by this environment, versus not having a safe space to rest.

I've been abandoned multiple times, including by a parent, and while antidepressants are helping, there are moments, especially after a social situation (which is sometimes worse when I actually know and like everyone there) where I just feel just a gap between me and others.

Part of being (told/blamed) abandoned by others has really made me rinse and repeat this idea that there is something fundamental about me being unlovable.

Now, I know that's not true, and I know autistic adults have higher reported rates of suffering from loneliness, but the first 3 long term relationships I had i communicated clearly, have progressively learned boundaries through these relationships to still take care of myself and not bend over backwards for my partners (they've been abusive and taken advantage of me i see now, thanks therapist), and they still ultimately blamed me or rejected me.

And all of these times they were the ones who fell in love with me when I was able to be my most genuine goofy self.

Im starting to feel like I will never be in a relationship with someone.

Being autistic, being Trans, it kind of feels at times that my future is spelled out to be alone or viewed as a fetish. Im tired, and I feel frustrated and lonely at times. 

Im doing okay just focusing on myself and my hobbies now that im alone, but I do find myself pondering if I'll ever actually be loved and accepted, in a relationship where I don't need to do all the labor around the house, emotional laboring in the relationship, and where my partner and I actually are willing to sit down with me and work through something, not just for them to bury it when it's inconvenient for them and then blow up at me.

I feel frustrated, misunderstood, and lonely.

I'd like to hear some stories from people when this gets better. I feel screwed. 

[But im also okay, I would like anecdotes and a pick me up to know im not alone and hear from others :) ]";;;;
2025-10-20 11:10:53;why do i feel like my adhd is getting worse;32f The last few years I’ve had to up my meds a few times it’s like the older i get the harder my adhd becomes to manage and quite frankly it makes me feel like such a failure bc on paper i have my own place i have a good job but i can’t keep track or uphold relationships (platonic and romantic), errands, even remembering to eat regularly like i just wish i was normal. It feels like my childhood truma of being “different” is rearing its ugly head again except this time i have bills to pay and personal standards to uphold. Idk adhd sucks and it can be a really crippling diagnosis to have bc it’s so misunderstood ;;;;
2025-10-20 10:06:46;Why is my mom positive about her disorder when most people on here hate it?;"My mom has professionally diagnosed moderate-severe combined adhd. She definitely didn’t get misdiagnosed, since she can take adderall easily and get more focused/normal when she does it. She also didn’t get diagnosed until 38 and didn’t know she had it before, and didn’t use adhd specific coping mechanisms.

She says it’s a super power, and although she doesn’t always think it is perfect, but she has an overall positive perspective. I don’t understand why people are always super negative about it.";;;;
2025-10-20 10:01:44;AS fits but it also doesn’t fit.;"I was diagnosed with ADHD many years ago and recently with mild OCD. I’ve always known this since as a kid I had different tics come and go. My OCD and ADHD has ebbed and flowed taking different forms over the decades. 
I have major sensory issues and trouble with overstimulation. I can easily end up in a terrible state if I’m socializing too much, if someone talks too much or too fast. Excessive noise. BORING small talk and shallow conversations that go on and on. Not feeling like I can escape and be alone. Not having proper time to recharge myself by being alone. I can really end up in a state where I’m sobbing, exhausted, angry, anxious, and absolutely at the end of my rope. I feel totally out of control like a child having a tantrum or it can feel more quiet with exhaustion and truly like I have the flu. 
I also have sensitivity to certain lighting and even avoid some places because I don’t like the lighting. I have trypophobia and avoid places that have these textures on rocks etc. So, mostly sensory issues. 
Normally I’m a very quiet, logical, and levelheaded person so this flip can be bizarre and alarming. I’ve been wondering lately if I’m actually AuADHD. The thing is I don’t relate to some of the classic hallmarks. I’m very good socially, have friend groups (always have), very astute with social cues, etc. Also, I have a lot of strength in figurative language and sarcasm. 
I’m just learning about AS and AuADHD. Curious how normal is not exactly fitting into some of the classic traits is?";;;;
2025-10-20 08:09:37;Understanding life right now;I'm 35m and I have never been properly diagnosed because I frequently mask my traits to fit in civilized society. I overanalyze social and political situations. I love in a small Illinois town and I don't quite know how to handle the recent protests. Trump seems too powerful. Violent offenders are more prevalent then they use to be. I can't afford anything right now and everyone seems to be on their phones, even when driving. I'm overstimulated by all of this. I can't figure out why we can't just get along. Ive had trouble connecting with anyone since my wife took her own life in 2018. I went through basic combat training in 2009 and advanced individual training shortly thereafter but was discharged because I failed to get the run time necessary to move on to deployment.  I would've gone straight to Iraq. I had children in 2022 and 2025. Ever since I had them as dependents, I've had to mask further to hide the fact that I very rarely get time to myself while looking after them. I feel like a horrible person by saying that I don't want to be around my kids because I love them with all my heart. I don't feel like I have access to support where I live. I feel unique but in a bad way. The world shouldn't be so complicated ;;;;
2025-10-20 07:52:49;Seeking an autism diagnosis, advice?;Does anyone know of a way to seek a diagnosis without face to face speaking? Including telehealth video chats.

I can hear myself answering their questions in my head, but i can't manage to communicate them aloud. It makes me very anxious. I've had panic attacks after telehealth appointments. But I can type and text perfectly fine. Maybe a long shot to ask, but is it possible to get diagnosed over text? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.;;;;
2025-10-20 06:13:27;18F - Relate to Autism but Can't Get Diagnosed (Advice Needed);"I've been debating this topic with myself for weeks now, and no matter how much I research or think it through, I can't seem to settle on a clear answer. I've been hyperfixating on it (literally nonstop), staying up late reading and researching, and at this point I figured maybe actually talking to someone about it could help me see things a bit clearer.

Before anything else: I'm not trying to self-diagnose. I really want to be respectful to people who have actual diagnoses and real experiences, and I know how messy and harmful self-diagnosis can get - especially with all the TikTok stuff going around. I've actually been trying to find any explanation that isn't autism or neurodivergence, but I haven't really found anything else that fits so far.

I'm not claiming anything, and I won't without a proper diagnosis (which is difficult in my situation and where I live autism, especially in adults, isn't really well-known or talked about here at all). I also know that no quiz or checklist can give a real answer, so I'm not relying on those either.

What I am hoping for is just some outside perspective preferably from people who are actually diagnosed - to maybe help me figure out if I'm just overthinking or if this is something I should take seriously. Because right now, I feel stuck. I literally can't focus on anything else and I just want some peace of mind.

Now for the kind of embarrassing part: I've actually written up an 11-page document (please don't judge me, I'm very sleep-deprived and desperate). It's basically a giant brain dump of everything I've noticed, experienced, or found while researching that made me start wondering if I might be on the spectrum. My original plan was to print it, throw it at a psychiatrist, and run away before I had to talk.

I know it sounds like a lot (because it is), but part of me thinks the fact that I even made something like that might be a bit telling on its own. So if anyone is willing to check it out and give me some honest feedback, I'd really appreciate it. You don't have to sugarcoat it - if it sounds like something else entirely, or just like me spiraling, that's okay too. I just want to know if this is worth pursuing or if I should just try to move on. (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to insert the document here)

But the biggest issue is: I can't get a formal diagnosis. Where I live, adult autism isn't really recognized. They don't even teach it properly in universities. There's no one I could realistically go to, and I don't have the time or money to chase down options that might not even exist.

I also don't like calling it ""self-diagnosis"" - because... what if I'm wrong?

So now I feel stuck. I don't know where I stand. So Any advice? Whether it's how to process this without a diagnosis, or just how to move forward without feeling fake - I'd really appreciate any help

Thanks so much if you read all this, really. It's been eating at me for a while and I'm still super unsure about all of it. Either way, hope you have a good day";;;;
2025-10-20 05:29:58;"My neurotypical friend and I constantly miscommunicate and it's straining our friendship; what can I do?";"I am on the spectrum, diagnosed with executive dysfunction officially but of course, I relate to the autistic community far more than a diagnosis can tell me. I have many issues with understanding the 'you're supposed to take the hint' style of communication that people to do me

Just one example, out in public with this friend, and there's something she doesn't want strangers to overhear;

* ""Oh hey, something up?""
* ""I'll tell you later.""
* ""Oh ok, I'm eagerly awaiting to hear about it... So it's later now, can you tell me what's up?""
* ""I was never going to; that's what 'I'll tell you later' means.""
* ""Why didn't you just tell me before?""
* ""Because neurotypicals in the store would know something is wrong if I said that, and I don't want them to know that either. And besides, why do you care so much?""

And look. I cannot stand this kind of communication. And despite her knowing this, she's been brought up with a very different way of thinking through things, and it's next to impossible for me to know all these 'social cues.' I'm aware she struggles to understand how to directly communicate with autistic people, but it makes her no less irritated when there's a misunderstanding. And looking beyond my own little world is also an issue... I could NOT care less if strangers know my deepest secrets. But I have to remember that other people \*do\* care

But for the problem at hand... we've recently had to take a break from one-another over this issue. Not the singular example from above, but that there have been way too many times lately where I didn't understand something she was trying to tell me and got upset about it, only for her to me mad at me that I didn't understand what she was trying to tell me. I feel like I'm constantly messing up, and she is irritated by my constantly failing to understand her, and we've had to stop and communicate whenever she's mad at me for not understanding to clear things up.

What can I even do about this? I'd like to know what others think, but I did come up with some possible solutions;

* A code phrase to say that only we know, so that she can let me know she doesn't want to talk about something but I know I what she means
* If we start an argument and I'm confused as to why, I will stop myself and say ""I'm sorry, I think I might be misunderstanding you right now""
* If I can feel that my curiosity is getting the better of me (""Why do you need to know?"") then I should also find a way to communicate that, I think";;;;
2025-10-20 05:22:12;The Unmasked Self;"This came up in my feed and it hit hard. As I said times before, my personal journey started a few months ago after diagnosis. Since then I have given myself certain accomodations and am discovering new sides to myself, and am learning to love myself more. I do not have a hope for cure, I know and fully understand that the causes of autism lie in brain sturcture and make up etc etc..... I know and understand the science (at a high level). But this video is about psychology and depression and learning to live life without a mask and discovering who I call my true self.

I feel like the odd one out, I don't know why I feel so inferior and so different from everyone else.  I'm just.. confused and not all there all the time.

2025-10-19 20:40:51;Recently diagnosed at 25 years of age;"Hello people.

I guess I am experiencing a bit of impostor syndrome, as I feel like a NT in many aspects. I don't really struggle with too many sensory issues, outside of loud, high-pitched noises and voices with an aggressive/frustrated tone (I had ARFID when I was younger, but I grew out of it). I have high empathy, and I am able to be social with few issues. I'm a teacher, therefore relatively good with other people. However, I never want to be social, as it is so incredibly draining. I never have a social gathering and think ""yes, I want to do this again"". Secondly, I can hold eye contact with pretty much anyone, but I am always conscious about it (where do I look, when do I change where I look) and it often takes the focus of any conversation.

My most autistic trait, I suppose, is that I completely live by routine. I ""can"" break routines, but I just don't want to most of the time. Additionally, it requires much effort and rumination to do so. I have been told by my treatment team that I have learned incredibly good masking skills as a coping mechanism in early life which have continued to evolve. I don't think I have any real special interests, but I always come back to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, and I have thousands of hours played in mostly the same video games. Not sure if that classifies as a trait of asperger syndrome.

I think the reason I got diagnosed in the end is because I have always struggled with either OCD, anxiety, or eating disorders. Perhaps these are just symptoms of autistic burnout? I really have no clue. But during treatment from my eating disorder both me and my therapist thought there was something more to it, which is why I seemingly don't make much progress despite trying really hard.

Anyway, I was mostly wondering if people share similar experiences to me?";;;;
2025-10-19 19:02:14;Does any autistic person identify with this?;"I’m a 27-year-old woman and I’ve been wondering lately if some of the things I experience might be related to someone here. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just curious to hear if anyone can relate to what I describe. 

I’m 27, and although I finished school at 16, graduated from university at 22, and already have a master’s degree, I was only able to join the workforce about a year ago, thanks to therapy. I’ve had many jobs, even some I dreamed of for years, but once I got them, I would quit within days because terrible anxiety took over. I felt trapped and just wanted to run away. I’m currently working, and even though my bosses are very kind and don’t pressure me, I constantly feel like they hate me and that I’m doing everything wrong. Working in person isn’t for me, so I hope to switch to remote soon.

Since childhood, I’ve always struggled to make friends. I was always the shy one who didn’t talk. Once, my entire class went to see a comedy movie, and while everyone was laughing hysterically, I was the only one who didn’t laugh, and they teased me about it for years. But I just can’t laugh if something doesn’t genuinely feel funny to me.

People say I’m very honest and speak without thinking.

There are certain physical pains that I actually enjoy,they make me feel strangely happy. Things like bee stings, vaccines, or ingrown nails. When I was little, I used to let bees sting me on purpose.

I don’t miss people much when they’re not around. If I go on a trip, I don’t really miss my parents. When my brother left for a year, I didn’t miss him much, only when I realized I wasn’t missing him did I start thinking about him more.

I have a pacifier that I use when I’m very anxious.

I make small movements with my fingers when I’m stressed, like rubbing them together without realizing it.

At work, I find it very hard to express myself. If I need to tell my boss something, I might spend the entire day trying to do it and end up saying nothing until the very end, or even postpone it.

People sometimes say I seem cold. I greet people, but they still feel it’s not enough, they think I’m indifferent.

I can go weeks without leaving the house and it doesn’t bother me.

I like going out alone and being by myself. I don’t have friends because, as much as I enjoy solitude, I can’t really maintain friendships. I won’t text or meet often.

Coffee gives me a lot of anxiety.

Showering or brushing my teeth isn’t easy. I do it every day, but it’s not something I enjoy, I do it quickly just to get it over with. If I put on clothes without showering first (even if I showered hours earlier), it feels uncomfortable on my skin.

I can be stingy with my food and belongings. It’s hard for me to share, even though I do it.

I don’t really have any fixations. As a child, I loved reading and did it all the time, but since I was 16, I haven’t been able to enjoy it. No book hooks me anymore, and I can’t seem to find any hobby that truly interests me.

I’m not very social, and sometimes I have to act to fit in, talking, pretending to be interested, or laughing when I’d rather just stay quiet and serious for a while.

When tragedies happen, I often don’t feel sad. Sometimes I even feel a little curious about what’s going to happen next.

There are many other things, but I can’t remember them all right now. I’d love to hear if anyone else relates to some of these experiences.";;;;
2025-10-19 17:35:37;Is it my Autism, ugliness, or am I just insufferable?;"I don't go out much anymore, but the few times I do I always end up as that one person in the group no one wants to talk to. My self worth has been as low as it can get recently so I've tried flirting or chatting with people when the group I've come with isn't interested in talking. No one wants to flirt. No one wants to talk.

I just stand alone in awkwardness. I have worked very hard my whole life to learn how to socialize and be more outgoing so I'm not just the diagnosis. But I feel like no matter how much progress I make I'm always that guy left off to the side that no one wants.";;;;
2025-10-19 16:10:43;Does anyone else struggle with transitions between different locations?;"Hi everyone, 

I’m diagnosed autistic and have other co-morbid mental health conditions, I just wanted to post on here and see if anyone else can relate/share some tips on making transitions easier. I go over to my partners house almost every weekend and always have trouble with going back home. I’ve always assumed it was the “Sunday scaries”but I wonder if it’s actually exacerbated by my asd? I’ll often feel quite low mood for 48 hours after coming back to my own house whether it be from a social gathering or a quiet weekend at their house. I’ve tried to push the feeling down but it just leads to me coping with unhealthy mechanisms. 

If anyone else can relate (even if it’s not specifically the same situation) could you please share some tips on how to make transitioning easier? I’ve tried self care rituals and honestly it just doesn’t hit the spot by itself, and I do know it’s good to tolerate your emotions but I just find these 48 hrs to be unbearable. 

Thanks in advance!

2025-10-19 16:07:22;Help me get a right diagnosis;"Hi! It’s my first time writing here.
I’ll try to make it short.
Tomorrow I have a visit to te Psychiatrist, and i would like to ask her to consider a diagnosis for autism or maybe adhd (something in the neurodivergent area).
When i was 13 they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder type 2, but I think they got it wrong.
The problem is, when I go to the doctor I act different from how I am at home or outside in general, so a lot of things that could be symptoms aren’t showing during our visits.
I’m not stupid, I compared symptoms between bipolar and autism/adhd and I know I relate to the second one and not the first one, but if I say this to the psychiatrist she will think I’m trying to self diagnose, and she will dismiss my idea. 
So my question is: what can I say to convince her to consider this diagnosis? And maybe make me take some tests? 
Thank you all!";;;;
2025-10-19 13:00:42;Not getting diagnosed;"I'm just kinda down and frustrated and hopeless at this moment. I just went through the diagnosis process and the result was: Everything points to autism, every test came back ""positive"", the doctor thinks I'm clearly autistic - yet I didn't get the diagnosis. Why? Because my mom can't remember any nonverbal difficulties during my childhood... and it's essential for getting diagnosed... 😑

I'm pretty certain my issues with eye contact didn't just start in adulthood. My childhood is roughly 40 years ago. Mom certainly doesn't remember certain things. I have an older brother with significant developmental issues, so in comparison I was the ""normal child"" to my mom. I also suspect my mom the have autistic traits as well, so certain things might seem normal to her that wouldn't necessarily seem normal to non-autistic people. Also, I've been masking from early childhood on. I remember being in kindergarten and feeling deeply upset whenever I did something ""wrong"". And I grew up at a time when children weren't watched and observed as closely as nowadays. My parents made sure we were fed, washed, had clothes and ""functioned"" on the outside. They didn't monitor our emotional wellbeing, let alone our nonverbal behavior.

All in all I feel confident to say that my mom's account is highly unreliable and that I certainly had unusual nonverbal communication. And it pains me that because of this I get denied the diagnosis, even though even the doctor agrees that I'm clearly autistic. It's the right thing to do in a formal way, but just wrong on so many levels.

So while I feel personally validated that I'm in fact autistic and I was actually never ""too sensitive, shy, quiet, weird"", I feel deeply invalidated on a societal level. I have struggled with anxiety pretty much my entire life starting at the age of 16, and I have encountered numerous therapeutical and medical professionals and been misunderstood and mistreated by so many of them, that it feels like playing the lottery to find someone who has enough empathy and openmindedness to actually listen to me and understand me. It has always felt like an uphill battle to feel seen and heard. And by denying me the diagnosis, it feels like it will continue to be like that, and it also means I get downright denied support for my struggles being an autistic person in a non-autistic world. Even though I know there isn't much available for autistic adults to begin with.

I don't really know what to do at this point. I guess I need to calm down a little first and then think of my next steps. Talk to my mom again if there's anything she remembers, talk to the doctor again. Maybe get a second opinion somewhere down the road if I feel strong enough again to handle another potential blow. I don't know. Right now, I just feel defeated.

2025-10-19 12:07:39;Looking for feedback from diagnosed women: Do these traits sound like autism?;"Lately, I’ve been reflecting on certain traits I had since childhood and couldn’t name. I’m not a psychologist and I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, but I’ve started to wonder if some of these traits might be connected to autism. I hate to be one of those self-diagnose people. So I thought it might help to list them and see if people diagnosed with autism can relate. 

As a child I had many sensory “habits” I am not sure what to call them exactly. For example, I used constantly pinch or lightly punch certain parts of my body, like my love handles, shoulders and thighs. I couldn’t help it; if I didn’t do it I would feel extremely uncomfortable. Some of these habits have faded away over time, but new ones have replaced them, even now I still pinch my shoulders or fingertips, a newer one is stretching my legs. I can’t resist them when I get the feeling i HAVE to do it. 

To continue with my childhood habits, my mom used to make me tiny sandwiches, I would line them up to eat them in exact order
that she made. if the order was mixed up or my mom couldn’t tell which one she made first I would get very frustrated. 

I also used to have a huge problem with my backpack weight, it HAD feel a certain weight on my shoulders, for example if we had a light day at school with fewer books, i still would add extra books so that my backpack reaches to its ideal weight lol. 

In elementary school I was a super shy girl, I wouldn’t speak much and I had only one friend. I would get so sad when she talked to other students in my class, however I have always enjoyed school. I was an average student. 

In middle school, there was a point I remember where I was constantly observing how people were communicating. I had made friends with cool girls in my class. And I was analyzing, literally studying their behavior how they talk, what they talk about, how they reacted to things. I felt like no one had taught me these before, and thought everyone at some point does the same thing I did. 

Now as a 20 year old I feel like I can communicate effectively, I can talk with people without getting stressed and handle social situations well, but I still analyze everything, every single detail in my head. 
It’s not easy for me to lie, or to break laws. 
People tell me Im hard to get close to or sort of break the ice with me and I feel that too, except with my Mom, I don’t feel emotionally connected to anyone not even to my oldest friends. 

I also love to plan things, if I don’t plan I will be paralyzed not knowing what to do. One of my friends was surprised that I even plan ahead and write it in my to do list when i wanna message a friend. Most of the things in my environment have a specific order and I don’t like to change it unless i feel it’s inefficient . I love listing things too. I love having an obvious structure for anything, and without instructions (either made by me or others) I feel lost.

I’m a fifth-year college student 22F with autism and ADHD amongst another slew of fun diagnoses (GAD, PMDD, C-PTSD, and MDD) and three sleep disorders (sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia).

I’m just going to be frank here: my accommodation’s office is absolutely ass at doing their job so I just took what I could get and communicated with my profs with the rest. They seem to be pretty tolerant of me turning things in late, thank god. Unfortunately, I still feel awful because my university grades us on a standard of “professionalism” which I sometimes fall short of and end up getting docked a grade or two for my final grade due to missing classes from oversleeping which is fair since attendance, being prepared, and showing up somewhere early are VERY IMPORTANT requirements for the job I will have (this was an issue that almost lost me my job too — my body does not let me decide when I wake up no matter what I do I kid you not and ever since I started using my CPAP it forces me to sleep 8 hours whether I want to or not which leaves me with like 2 hours to do anything when I come home from school and then I work beforehand and can’t move back in with my parents), I have one semester until I have a semester of an internship and then graduate…I hope.

I was a gifted and straight-A’s kid in K-12. It wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I started experiencing severe task paralysis and ended up having over 600 missing assignments total over the entirety of the 2020-21 school year. Thankfully, everything was online on a software that was completely asynchronous, and I had basically completed more of what an average senior would have my junior year, and it didn’t matter when my assignments were turned in, just that it was.

I brushed it off as just a bad year because of the obvious reason of what was happening in the word at the moment. Then, I started college that August.

Man, did I flop. I ended up getting formally diagnosed with ADHD and my psychiatrist telling me we could assess for it if I needed documentation but he was “pretty sure I was also autistic.” (Spoiler: I got diagnosed this January actually by someone completely different). Medication has always been an issue; whether it being that it doesn’t work or not having access to it (I’m taking 15mg Adderall and 112.5 mg of Effexor).

After my diagnosis and getting on medication, I started doing a little bit better but still struggling a ton. I figured out I was really sensitive to stimulants so I’m on a pretty low dose for an adult and that the non-stimulant options gave me burning stress-hives all over my body. I still had to struggle a lot to get even a B, and feel bad for how little I felt I have truly learned throughout my degree because I have had to cut corners and turn in less than ideal quality of work to keep myself from breaking down nightly (I mean, it doesn’t really work). What I’m currently studying is so important to me so it hurts so much that I can’t find it in me to start. I think about how long I have to work and how much I have to do and if it’s even possible to do everything and just start sobbing. 

Learning techniques to help myself is also something I have been fascinated by and I feel like I have tried everything out there to help myself at this point that I could think of, find in the internet, or that people bring up (and yes, for extended periods of time). I have expressed this to everyone around me and that I feel like a failure and that it makes me look horrible to people I deeply respect and care about.

In class, I feel like the one dragging people behind or the annoying one to be partnered with in discussions because no I didn’t do the reading and if I did I know I could contribute so much. I’m already graduating later than I was supposed to due to failing many courses and also just having a long-ass degree. I told my family they could look forward to me graduating this semester and they are putting a lot of pressure on me to be done by May and making me feel like a lazy POS for feeling like I can’t do anything and I honestly feel like it too. I want to be done with this Bachelor’s degree so fucking badly.

I have dug myself a hole here…again. Usually every semester starts off semi-strong and then I MAJORLY tank when it starts to ramp up. I have been sick a total of 12 times this year and one was this fall and it was the most recent time. I was out of school and work for an entire week and I got behind and everything just snowballed and I now have like 20-40 missing assignments that are big chunks of my grade and long projects I can’t afford to not do and I’m in 18 credits because I was told by others in my class with ADHD that they were low effort and so I’m now p a n i c k i n g. 

When I am able to focus and actually do work, it’s not super reproducible. There isn’t one single thing I can think of that gives me extra motivation or energy or makes me feel better or whatever and then I’m productive. 

I just feel like I’m broken. Like nobody can help me. I have seen psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, sleep doctors, executive functioning coaches through the accommodations office, talked to peers, had blood work done, etc. and I still don’t know what is so wrong with me nor do I have the tools to help myself and so I just keep going like the best I can because I am trying to fight feeling like I’m broken because I know that attitude won’t be helpful for me and if this semester is still redeemable that I should continue. I thought the issue was my sleep but it looks like it wasn’t that. My diet isn’t the greatest and I don’t exercise a lot because with how stressed I am I can’t really afford either in the ways needed. I’m disappointing myself over and over again. I have kids depending on me to do my assignments at my fieldwork experiences which puts more pressure on me and when I’m finally regulated I just pass out and fall asleep. I barely have the energy in my body to stay upright sometimes and even walking sometimes is a lot on me now and it’s frustrating because it feels like everyone around me doesn’t have it easy but that it’s easy enough for them to do things and if they were in my situation minus the diagnoses they could get things done without a problem. 

This is a problem throughout my life with everything that requires task initiation and sustained attention. I feel like I can’t get anything done other than the once in a while spurt of productivity where my body decides it wants to function now. Not able to do chores so there’s been a lot of mold unfortunately, and barely just getting to school and work. I’m living off of my current convenient safe foods because I don’t even have the energy to make mac and cheese or something: just hot pockets, uncrustables, and cosmic brownies which is not super great for my GERD and I’m coughing all the time from heartburn setting my throat on fire. All I have the capacity for at the moment are dumbass mobile app games and watching YouTube and twitch streams and it’s terrible for me but I can’t seem to stop. Even when I have uninstalled them for months in the past, it hasn’t seemed to improve things much and it is still difficult to do anything, like I distract myself?

I am SO CLOSE to being done! I just want to be done and I don’t want to give up. Any suggestions? Anyone been here before? Please be nice this has been really hard and I thought if anyone would remotely understand, it would be y’all. I apologize in advance if the information is kind of jumbled.";;;;
2025-10-19 07:02:30;Are there any other high-functioning Autists with intersecting identities out there?;"Hey so this is my first person on this subreddit and I just wanted to introduce myself and who I am. I'm a black high-functioning autistic guy who was diagnosed in elementary school at the age of 10. Since then I've learned few things about myself. Aside from my ASD, I'm also disabled with UC and I'm bisexual and genderfluid. Back in school, I never really had any friends who were like me. 

I came across a few black kids who were on the spectrum, but they were of low-functioning than me. I have the type of autism where you wouldn't be able to tell I had it unless I told you. I mask pretty well and I don't really have any 'tics' or triggers. My experience ever since my diagnosis has been mixed so far. I was put in a special class throughout middle school and high school with trivializing results. I always felt like I didn't fully belong in the class while simultaneously needing the help they provided. If I had to describe it, I'm a very introverted and reserved individual, but that doesn't mean I won't open myself up. I just find myself to be very observing and choosey with who I open myself up to.

I've never been in a relationship with anyone and to be frank, I don't see myself ever being in a relationship. I just feel like people will see my traits and just don't want to deal with it. I'm a multi-layered person, and I just think people don't know how to engage with a person like me. I've spent plenty of time on the Internet and locally trying to find places where I can meet like-minded people like me, but it seems like for a person like me to have all my traits: black, male, bi, genderfluid, autism, disabled, it's next to 0. 

Aside from those external traits, my interests are somewhat more artsy. I like a multitude of things and have different hyper fixations. Ever since I was a kid I always had a fascination in technology and videogames and would use to mod my consoles and games and teach myself how to use a computer amongst other electronics. As I got older in my teens I started to get into electronic tinkering and would take apart my devices and reassemble them, and making new DIY devices. I got into theater in middle school and was a drama student throughout high school. Singing, dancing, and music has always been my passion since I was a child, and I write songs to this day. I also like to draw and do animations, and recently I've began to pick up voice acting as a side hobby.

That's kind of a general overview of who I am. I always had hope that someone out there like me exists. It's difficult being on the spectrum alongside with other intersecting identities. It can make you feel isolated in a world that already tries to box you in with one trait. I do try to have hope that I can find some people out there who accept me for who I am and potentially find a partner. I know it won't happen today, but it's worth a try reaching out.

I'd love to hear your guy's experiences.

Cheers <3";;;;
2025-10-19 05:10:53;What was your experience like when you were diagnosed?;"Did you already suspect it might be Asperger's? Did you know if anyone else in your family had been diagnosed with it?

Were you familiar with the syndrome beforehand? Did you think it might be something else?";;;;
2025-10-19 03:51:15;My whole identity feels fake;"Sometime ago I started to suspect that I may be autistic but now I'm slowly convincing myself that every single symptom that I exhibit is just me faking it to ""seem autistic"". It's gotten so bad that now I'm pretty sure that even my (diagnosed) ADHD is also just me faking and that I acted my way to get the diagnosis. Is it even possible? It's borderline making me question my whole identity. It feels like I just act the way I want to act and that it is my entire personality.";;;;
2025-10-19 03:06:31;How do I get over the anger I feel towards the past after reading a very old email from my mom ?;"I was diagnosed late. A while ago now but not so long ago that I'm over it. 

Despite being diagnosed late, I was very much ""a problem"" and at age 13-14, I got hospitalised one to many times and was placed in a foster care center. (Not like a foster family, more of an institution for teens with nowhere to go) I stayed untill I grew out of it. 

Therefore, I spent my youth zoned out on antipsychotics, convinced my behaviour was manipulative and wrong. That the needs I felt were wrong. I spent all of those years in therapy trying to ""fix it"", just to get hit 10 years later with an autism diagnosis coming straight out of nowhere during what was supposed to be a confirmation of ADHD. 

Up untill now I think I dealt with the feelings that came with this, about how much it shaped the past, how destructive the ""support"" I received had actually been, ... by telling myself: ""my symptoms were not obvious, they could not have known back then"". I mean, neither my parents or I noticed, how could the doctors? Thinking about it that way made it tolerable. Just lack of knowledge in the ""old days"" . 

Still, I have made a lot of progress since getting the correct support. It's hard to look back and think I was in the right and only place available to me to get help, only to just be hurt by it. 

A few days ago, I accidentally came across an email my mom sent me in 2012. It hit as a brick falling on my head would. Relationship issues with my mother aside, this is the exact way she presented things back then. Multiple doctors heard these words, her words, time and time again. 

> I could see you had the flu but I knew that talking to you would make you angry so I just wanted to be with you. But I did ask you something and you put your hands on your ears and told me to shut up. Ok, I thought, no problem, she's unwell. I'm not going to list all the times you made a huge fuss when I was only calmly asking you something or when you were telling me off for things like melting butter in the wrong bowl. Especially as you seemed to be able talk to other people without the aggression. Thats not my point. But I never said anything or reacted to any of if until I told you that I didn't want to watch the slow to load tv show every night anymore, that we could watch it on the weekend. Everything deteriorated from that point.

.....

F*ck

It WAS OBVIOUS actually.......... This whole time. Stuff I buried so deep I don't even remember. 

I am left today with many issues in communication and in my relationships that really make me suffer a lot. Pushes people I love away. I've acted in so many unhealthy ways to try to ""fix"" something that could not be fixed by those standards. All this time, I could have been learning strategies that could and would have prevented so many of the events and behaviours and patterns that did *actually* hurt me. 

I'm just angry at a void and I have no idea what to do with it. There is no one to blame, and yet there are so many people to blame. And it's not even about blame but it's like there is an energy with the anger that will not go away and it has nowhere to direct itself. 

What am I even angry at? Where do I put this energy? 

Have you ever been angry at the past after realising something ? What do you do with it, when it's no longer possible to avoid looking straight at it ? Does it get better now ?? Or worse?";;;;
2025-10-19 01:44:55;My mum embarrasses me and I feel guilty;"I feel guilty even writing this but it’s been bothering me for a long time and I need to get it off my chest. I've even created a new account just to say this

My mum is 51 and undiagnosed autistic. I’m certain she’s autistic because Im diagnosed and all three of her other kids are too. She’s shown autism traits since she was a baby and still does. She grew up in Africa, where disabilities especially autism, were seen as taboo or “the work of the devil.” Because of that, she never got the diagnosis or support she needed.

Recently, after I talked to her about my own autism, she admitted she thinks she’s autistic too. I was and still am so proud of her for being open about it because it’s something I never thought she’d do.

But ever since then, she’s completely unmasked. And in all honesty it embarrasses me. I'm the biggest hypocrite because how come I can unmask but she can’t? I should really be happy for her, 51 years of masking who you are is something loads of people couldn't do. But watching her go from being my mum to acting like a baby is hard. Literally, like a baby. She makes baby noises all day, whines, sometimes cries like a baby, and even talks in baby talk constantly.

I appreciate that she finally feels safe enough to be herself, but it makes me so uncomfortable. I don’t even invite friends or family over anymore because I feel embarrassed. I'm a young adult and know I should be more mature about this but i'm struggling to understand why I can't. I genuinely don't understand why I lack the ability to handle this better.

I hate that I feel this way. I feel selfish, ungrateful and cruel for even thinking this. But it’s been eating at me and even beginning to affect our relationship and I needed to say it somewhere";;;;
2025-10-19 00:31:55;Depression after diagnosis;I don’t know if anyone else had this kind of experience, but it has been messing me up a lot lately and so I would just like to rant a bit. I feel like wherever I look (online) everyone is so happy about receiving their diagnosis and it’s like that piece of paper pulled some internal switch and now everyone accepts and loves themselves as they are. That is probably not the case but that’s at least the majority of what I can find online and it makes me feel a bit angry, because I don’t share that sentiment at all. I got my diagnosis at age 22 and up to this point I still had the slight hope that I might outgrow my awkwardness or that it is just due to CPTSD, so I could be healed from it and still have a normal life. Now I know that this won’t be possible and it has lead to a many months long (and ongoing) depressive episode, because I now feel limited by this diagnosis. As there is nothing I can change about my neurotype I will just have to accept that I will never be able to have friends, a relationship and looking at the statistics about unemployment rates in autistic adults it may also be questionable whether I will be able to maintain a job. Many other autistic people seem to feel empowered by their diagnosis but with the previously listed things in mind it is difficult for me see anything empowering or positive about it. It’s like I will never be able to improve myself because there are some things which I will not be able to change. Before receiving my diagnosis I was at least able to pretend like things might get better some day. Sorry for all that depressive shit, but I have been ruminating on these thoughts for months and I really just need to get them out of my head. If anyone, who has or had the same or similar initial thoughts about their diagnosis as I have, could offer some advice on how to deal with this situation, I would be very grateful. ;;;;
2025-10-18 22:32:51;Hi! I'm confused on what this is and need some help!;"Hello! I'm a senior in highschool and have been PROFFESIONALY diagnosed with the following: OCD, ADD, anxiety, and CPTSD. I have not been diagnosed with anything else, so I don't kmow what this is. 

I was told maybe it could be stress? Since this is my first year in a real public school. For some reason my head will jerk, and I make these sharp inhale noises and then an outward sharp squeaky noise. I haven't quite mentioned it yo my therapist because I've brushed it off as weird stims, but I feel it's getting hard to keep them contained in school, etc. I can contain the random noises and body stiffening(??) About 70% of the time, but the other times it's pretty much useless and I cannot control it. 

Google told me to go in for something wrong with me neck? But it seems like more of a stim? Like a stim I have trouble controlling at some points. Like my body needs to? Or more like my mind needs to. If I try to contain it, my mind says ""do it."" And then I have to. It's not a game I can win. 

I know for a fact it is not something like Tourettes. I think it's an odd stim correlation to my OCD telling me to do it. What are your thoughts? ";;;;
2025-10-18 20:02:26;Advice.;"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with adhd and some other things at the beginning of this year. Since then i have been trying to figure out life post diagnosis. However there is something i keep coming back to though and i just would like any opinion, but my own. 

Has anyone ever felt the need to apologise to an ex? lol. Stay with me. I normally would just move on, and make peace with the past. All  the things i found confusing or i couldn't understand about him, i now understand are symptoms of adhd. As i also do them, in different ways. I guess it's just shifted my perspective completely. He had once quickly mentioned he had adhd and i guess i didn't really deep it because he never spoke of it and at the time i was probably a little ignorant and in denial of my own shit. 

idk im just confused. 

thanks ";;;;
2025-10-18 18:49:15;Parents - how to improve our relationships or simply accept them for what they are?;"Hey team,  
  
I'm a male that has recently been diagnosed with autism at 30 years old. This has left a lot of questions/thoughts ringing in my brain.

One major topic is my relationship with my parents. I've never been genuinely close with my dad while the relationship with my mom is better. There was a lot of dysfunction growing up, to say the least. It has taken a while to work through the mental/emotional damage caused from growing up in an unstable environment and I suppose being undiagnosed didn't help.

I have accepted that we're simply different people, our interests don't generally intersect and we all have drastically different communication styles and expectations when it comes to mental and emotional connection. We still spend time together but I don't really enjoy it. A lot of the time I honestly feel like I could go without seeing them ever again despite still holding a baseline care for them both.

I guess I am curious on everyone's experience with their parents, for those comfortable sharing their stories. Has anyone found ways to improve their parental relationships? Are there any happier/success stories of parent relationships? ";;;;
2025-10-18 13:27:43;Has anyone managed to start their own business and what advice would you give?;"I'm a wildlife Photographer who was diagnosed as a child and had a bad experience a few years ago after accepting a trainee position as a marketing assistant through job seekers, this turned out to be more or less a lie and was left to run an entire family business by myself  with no rota or experience and minimal training in marketing.

I was getting calls at 3am on my days off to cover for people or go lock up because the manager forgot and would have to drive into town only to get up a few hours later to do even more shifts for something that was meant to be marketing and photography training related. 

I had worked retail previously and I still had anxiety but could function, however after this experience I had a severe panic attack and had to leave the position after 6 weeks. 

The stress and shame from that experience was so bad that I developed chronic insomnia and an eating disorder which my gp has been struggling to help me with. Lost a lot of my male friends because I couldn't handle this job as well which made me feel even worse. 

Doesn't look like I'm built to deal with that kind of environment or the public in general anymore and I'm considering starting to sell my photography online as a way to atleast try to move forward with my life even if it's at a limp. 

I created an online store with a printing + shipping website called darkroom.tech and wanted to know if anyone else went down a similar path in regards to selling art online or has advice on things like how it's affected you etc or how you keep yourself from burning out? 

I don't expect to make a lot of money, just want something that promotes my work that I can develop and focus on whilst I'm dealing with the insomnia. ";;;;
2025-10-18 12:05:43;struggling with reacting appropriately;"hi y’all, i have a question. i’m not looking for diagnosis stuff but i’ve suspected i was neurodivergent for a while and i can usually cope pretty well with proper communication. but this issue i’ve been having is hard for me to understand and manage. 

i was listening to my sister talking about her job interview coming up and i’m really excited for her but i’m having conflicting thoughts bc i’m lowkey jealous bc i’m also job searching. so i wasn’t reacting very excited even though i am. i live with my sister and we know each other well so she clocked it and we had a bit of an argument about it. she’s used to my lack of reaction (flat affect? idk) but she said she felt differently about this one and it makes her not want to express excitement about it and we talked it out. so that situation is handled.

but this made me think about how i’m very much not a reactionary person unless it’s something i’m passionate about but even then, i don’t let myself get too excited or i cringe at myself later. when someone tells me about something interesting, even if it’s the most interesting thing in the world, i feel like i’m putting on a show when i react. i’ve lowkey hated receiving presents, not bc of the gift itself but bc i’m nervous about not giving an appropriate reaction. it’s like i subconsciously can’t see myself from the outside so for fear of embarrassing myself, i put a mask on to avoid that.

i went to a convention and actually felt myself unmasking and let myself be weird and goofy without worrying about what others think. but months later, i think of how others must have seen me and cringe even though i know it doesn't matter.

so i guess my question is, if any of y'all deal with this, how do you manage it?";;;;
2025-10-18 10:04:20;Just once I want to tell someone I’m autistic and not get hit with some variation of “yeah I can tell”;"Come on, man. Now I want a run down of exactly how you can tell. I don’t think I can ask for a full analysis of my behavior but I desperately want to. 

I’m a nurse at a daycare for disabled kids and my coworker used to be a preschool special ed teacher. We were playing with an autistic patient and I talked about how I could relate to him sensory seeking because I’m also autistic. She said “yeah I can tell, I don’t think it would be as obvious if I hadn’t worked with autistic children but you definitely have a touch of the tism” 

The other similar incident was when I was in group therapy and afterwards a woman approached me and told me she works with autistic kids and followed that up with “have you been diagnosed yet?”


On one hand it’s kind of comforting to know that many people interpret me as ND vs a weirdo who is blunt and awkward but on the other hand it makes me overthink my behaviors. Like name exactly which traits of mine are clueing you in, because I had been operating under the assumption I was killing it at masking. I think that because I’m able to make extended eye contact I get convinced everyone must be fooled but like, I guess not. 

Idk like I want to have specific examples of my actions that seem autistic and know what the final straw was that made them certain I’m autistic. I get that both of the examples do tell me what made them think I’m autistic because they both basically just said that I remind them of kids they’ve worked with but I want to know specifically what the crossover is.

2025-10-18 08:31:12;Observing society;"I’m on fence about my self diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome. Let’s just say I likely am but there’s stigmas around having Asperger’s that I refuse to accept. 

Anyhow, I spend a lot of my time on the internet watching content and reacting to social media. I will often come across commenters on threads and after countless hours of exposure to these threads I’ve determined that if my point of view is an “autistic” pov I’d rather be autistic than normal.

For example, I’ll come across a social media post of an Ai creation. Now I know Ai is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality but even earlier adaptations apply. People in the comments could be divided into 3 groups. Hypothetically let’s say the Ai post is Martin Luther king Jr smoking a joint with Tupac. The comments will be of 3 genres: the 1st being the gullible idiots.  “Dr. King knew Tupac? No way! Why have I never seen this before?” Or something like “no wonder Tupac was so political in his raps he used to kick
It with Dr. King 👑 “ the second genre of comments
You will see are the “smarty pants detectives” “yeah right this is Ai I bet” or “wait why Dr. King don’t look any different. When was this taken? Is this real?” The 3rd genre of comments are the jesters, the clowns that don’t take anything serious “Yeo Dr. King and PAC smoking that Biggie pack” and then there’s me and my point of view which sees something like this maybe giggles in my head and moves on because it’s a waste of time arguing or even sharing a thought about such a trivial silly post. Basically I don’t see the point in anything that most people do or spend their time doing. I’m not saying i have life figured out better than most people because I don’t, but I’m also not living nearly as reactionary as most people seem to be and yet I’m supposed to believe it’s because I’m “autistic “ but objectively I feel like I could argue it’s the more reasonable point of view to have ";;;;

2025-10-18 06:59:55;Social awkwardness at work leading to additional emotional weight;"So I‘ve just come home from work and I genuinely feel so overwhelmed and burnt out. I work as a waitress at a small-ish bar/ restaurant and I‘m only doing this during my gap year. (I‘m not particularly passionate about it all but nonetheless there‘s worse things I could be doing. ) 

Additional info: I’m 18/w


One thing that I‘ve noticed though is, that I feel like every other waiter/ waitress is just simply better at doing things. Like they’ve been given additional rules and explanations (or as if they had been programmed to just know how everything works). Even other inexperienced people like me.
For example I really try my hardest to be friendly and engage with customers and recognize their wants and needs. But I have absolutely no idea what to say most of the time, or when I’m not asked a question regarding the menu etc. Like I don’t understand how conversations in such a setting work. Because I feel like it would be unprofessional to ask them any questions in return but it’s also really awkward when noone says anything and i walk off to get the drinks. Right?


Is this typical for autistic people? 
Because I pursued a diagnosis a year ago. But the responsible therapist basically said: “we suspect it might be autism, but as you’re doing fine at school and face no further problems, you are not under enough psychological stress for it to be autism…” (= suspected autism but not enough difficulties).
Are these the ‘difficulties’ and ‘psychological stress’ catching up with me because in the ‘real world it’s much more difficult to mask then at school????
Should i pursue a re-evaluation of the diagnosis?

Has anyone had similar experiences? And how have you managed to make progress in understanding these types of situations and how to act?



I don’t even know if that made any sense whatsoever.

2025-10-18 05:21:26;Need basic advice about first acute autistic shutdown;"Hi! I am 26F, who was diagnosed with C-PTSD for the longest time and medicated for it. My ptsd symptoms eased off in the last years and I came off of my meds this year.

Now I am realising, what we taught were panic attacks or potential psychosis is not… well panic attacks or psychosis. It’s actually meltdowns and extreme sensory overload. 

Normally, in this state, they would give me anxiety meds and dull it out. But I now understand autism better, see how radically I fit into the patterns and understand this isn’t just a panic attack.

2025-10-18 04:34:04;When I had a melt down my husband yelled at me to shut up;"The other day I (F29) had a melt down in the car and my husband (M30) who then yelled at the top of his lungs to shut up. I want to know if this is normal?

Currently we have been dealing with issue after issue going on in our lives in terms of health issues and our house and what seems like everything in general. 

I have autism, sever anxiety and severe depression among other health issues. Currently our house has daily construction that is stressing me out due to legal reason we need to take the previous owners to court and the construction is a lot longer than it was supposed to be. I feel every bump and hear everything even with my headphones and have been feeling and getting sick due to it.

Since I still have appointments with doctors I asked due to being overwhelmed and seriously not doing well if I cannot talk in the car because I keep having panic attacks daily as well as melt downs and don't think I can talk to my partner without a fight starting or panic attack. I am stressed to cause a fight as by the end of our talks it feels that is what my husband is saying.

My husband said I wasn't trying hard enough, and that is not normal to not talk in the car. I stated I am not normal in general but he said he isn't going to stay in the car not talking to me which we have driven not talking when I was physically ill many times. I kept asking repeatedly after we fought in the car can we not talk because I am overwhelmed currently and need a break. I am trying to do better with communication but have no therapy for autism only being recently diagnosed the health system is slow. So I try researching myself and finding alternatives. I can sometimes even stop mid through a panic attack or melt down and communicate I am having one I need to stop the fight because he is upset when I have one in the car and does not let the right stop by continuing to yell at me but also he doesn't want to stop talking. He says I started it and is angry at me at that point and continues fighting which I addressed was an issue but doesn't seem to be working on it on his side. 

Yesterday the doctor I saw was very stressful and when we were driving back our car was not working properly so I really did not want to talk but when I tried on the way there saying I didn't want to talk to him because he was mean to me that morning he said ok you don't need to say all that just say you don't want to talk. Later while driving he still talked to me asking me a question which I thought was serious about the construction. He asked if babies/children could eat fish... I feel like he refuses to listen to my boundaries and I answer to not get him more angry. I understand him not listening to me when angry in the sense it is the same as a panic attack but he was calm in the car and silent when asking about the fish.

During the ride back I had a bad melt down because I mentioned a paper was bothering me and asked why did he put his medical document on the sun visor. My husband said you put it there I didn't and I said no I didn't what do you mean this is your document you got when I was not even with you. Feeling overwhelmed no matter what I say is taken seriously and feeling a fight was starting I had a panic attack/melt down. He said you touched it today and I explained because it bothers me and I need the sun visor to protect my eyes I am very sensitive so yes I will have to touch your document when opening the visor but it was there before. He then stated why didn't you say agree to disagree and I asked ok why didn't you say that. As at the moment I felt everything was my fault.  I unfortunately can't remember a lot of our arguments just bits and pieces due to blacking out or spacing out I don't understand what happens. Due to  panic attacks, stress trying to explain something and excitement I do raise my voice and was in the moment but I explain everytime it's because I am trying to explain myself and very stressed and I try to control my volume if pointed out but just like when I am excited to say something I don't notice the volume increase either. Eventually he said good job trying not to yell at me in the car and said a lot of things for a few minutes which happens he goes on rants about me when we fight and I tried not excavating but at the end said this isn't de-escalation or like something along the line explaining this isnt healthy and he cut me off yelling at the top of his lungs shut up. 

I asked him to stop doing that yelling at the top of his lungs for me to shut up as he has done it multiple times to me already sometimes in my face which at his volume really hurts my ears. I feel kind of scared at this point to say things because I don't want that to keep happening but he doesn't stop when I asked him to already. 

He tried going to therapy regarding his anger but the therapist dropped him as a client she stated she can't do anything to help him as he knows what to do and he then blamed me for forcing him to go to therapy, it was a waste of money when he was depressed at the time.


Update:
I've been mute trying to avoid him the best I can only text for important things. Then told me ""if you weren't listening Monday I will get the car fixed"". So I pointed out listening I was sleeping. And he said so what I am saying has no context to what he said. So I said you could have just said you are going to your dad's place not the not listening part. He said ""Im honestly just going to ignore you because yikes.What you read from that text is from you alone. But wtv it is, leave me out of it because woof."". I then said you tell me when something is bothering me but how can I when you react like this we started to fight through text.

He says I acted very fucked up in the car. That I put us in danger because I wouldn't listen to him just so I could blast him. Apparently I kept making personal jabs during the conversation (but all I remember was me trying to explain myself that I didn't put it there it made no sense). He also said if you cannot contain your emotions during a car ride wait until you get home simple as that. Because I did that I crossed his boundaries that he asked me the day before.

I'm kind of constantly tired from not sleeping to be honest and constantly having melt downs and really hate myself at the moment ";;;;
2025-10-18 02:24:58;ASD Adult Professional life issues;"I’m an adult diagnosed autistic.

Problem 1: Shutdowns at events  
Whenever I’m at any kind of event, I tend to shut down. It used to be fine in personal events because people don’t really care, but in professional events it comes with a cost — I just can’t function properly or contribute.

I feel like I’m floating or not really present. In new cities or restaurants, I don’t know what to say, my mind just stops working. Once, at a head office event with about 100 people, I blanked out so badly that the presenter (Head of HR) actually came over to me and started a conversation after noticing my blank face. My life is full of embarrassing moments like this in large gatherings.

Washing my face with cold water helps a bit, but I still struggle to the point where I can’t be a meaningful part of what’s going on — and that ends up hurting me professionally. I work from home now, but I get really anxious whenever I’m called to attend something in person. Recently there was a restaurant event, and I just refused to go. I’m scared of being in that situation again.  
How do others deal with this kind of shutdown?

Problem 2: Anticipatory anxiety  
Whenever there’s a face-to-face meeting coming up, I start feeling this tingling in my chest. It’s exhausting. I prefer emails and clear written agendas, but that’s not always possible.

Before interviews, it gets much worse. I usually do great in the technical part, but the conversational part ruins it. I start rambling, speaking too fast, or sounding overconfident without meaning to. I feel like my personality becomes the reason I don’t get selected.

In recorded interviews, I do really well — and when I make it to the final face-to-face round, they often start by saying how impressed they were with me. But then that round turns into a total mess. Afterward, I crash so hard that I just want to sleep all day.  
How do people deal with this kind of anticipatory anxiety and the crash that follows?";;;;
2025-10-18 00:47:15;the woes of unmasking;"I was diagnosed 5 years ago and have been unmasking for around 2 years now. I don't mask anymore beyond like having manners and I never plan on masking again, but wow people really don't like it.

I feel like every time I leave the house and have a conversation with another person, they are completely misunderstanding what I am saying. Maybe this was always happening but I feel like it is definitely way more frequent. This leads to people talking down to me and making fun of me. It almost feels like they are purposely misunderstanding me because they don't like me. I don't know how to explain it, but when someone really misunderstands me, it comes across differently than when it is someone looking for a chance to bite my head off.

I had a recurring incident with a coworker earlier this year where I would start saying something, and she would cut me off to tell me I am wrong, even though she had no clue what I was even going to say. At one point we were talking about current events and I brought up some similar things that had happened in history and she cut me off with ""yeah but all those things are illegal now"" when that was about to be part of my point, followed up with how they are now starting to legalize things that WERE illegal. 

The infantilizing is driving me a bit crazy as well. I am either treated like a big stupid child or like a poor sweet helpless baby. I am not ""out"" as autistic to anyone besides friends and family but I fee like it is fairly obvious. I live in a more progressive area and many, many people are very open about their autism, it is slightly more accepted here than other places. 

No one liked me when I was masking, and I would say that the people who do like me now like me A LOT, but in exchange my haters are unbelievably nasty. It feels like the more ""me"" I become, the stronger people feel about me. Even random strangers out in the wild will immediately have either strong positive or negative reactions to me. I will say that the people who do like me are typically very intense and I have had several instances of people begging me to be friends with them. I had a guy who spent months asking me every single day to be friends with him. I was starting to get genuinely scared of him. 

All of this is making me not want to leave my house anymore. Basically every time I go outside and interact with another person, it is unpleasant, even if they mean well. 

I am curious as to if this is something non-autistics and NT folks deal with as well. Are these just the natural consequences that everyone who chooses to be themselves must suffer?  When I talk to others, they say that I am attractive and that this impacts peoples behavior around me as well, as people have a bias around attractive people. Does anyone else have this experience?

Im male 31 i was diagnosed with level one autism signs of assburgurs. Im an adult with a job as a tattoo artist. I recently went through a divorce cause my spouse cheated a bunch. My only father figure died years ago all family is pretty much no contact I had outbursts as a kid I wasn't diagnosed with autism they diagnosed me with add and anger issues. So my whole life my mom and sister leaned on me being an angry person. My grandfather raised me to protect my sister. Later in life she got an abusive bf and it was one too many times of seeing her asking him to stop so I attacked him pre diagnosis of autism. My sister for whatever reason hates me for defending her she tried having me thrown in jail and committed. The only one who's trying to be part of my life now is my mom but shes too hands off of a mother. Her excuse is always how she doesn't want to get involved between me and my sister and I argued with her last night well of course not cause getting involved with your children would make you a mother so youre not gonna do that. She claims to treat us the same but its not. Now my sister has a level 3 severely non verbal autistic son and I am bitter cause since they know early theyre gonna show this kid the life I never got. I was shown tough love threatened hit. Threatened with homeless Ness sent to jail over outbursts. And I know they aren't going to do that to him. I went off on my mother about not letting me stay im stressed depressed and suicidal and I need support but my sister doesn't want me around. She got her karma. You can say I'm fucked for saying that but now she's gonna have to deal with probably worse outbursts for the next 16 years ;;;;
2025-10-17 23:02:02;Has this happened to anyone else?;"


I’m already suspecting inattentive adhd in myself, my mom is professionally diagnosed with combined moderate-severe ADHD, I have symptoms my whole life, and both of my psychiatrists independently considered it. 

I’ve gotten so obsessed with adhd, and it’s literally all I think about all day. It’s come to a point where I literally feel more offended when someone says “you don’t have ADHD” over someone calling me gay, fat, ugly, or pretty much any other insult.

I think it’s because as I learned about adhd, I learned how to control my hyperfixations, so I decided to get more obsessed with adhd, but then I get way too obsessive over it. It feels like my whole life revolves around it. ";;;;

However, for a lot of us, self-diagnosis was the first step the realization that we were finally who we were after years of being misinterpreted and confused.

2025-10-17 17:20:21;Genuine question: what are the benefits re treatment and life improvement of getting an official diagnosis in midlife? I’ve been unofficially diagnosed as ‘just’ meeting the criteria so uncertain if I should proceed.;"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid in the early 90’s and rediagnosed more recently. I see a psychiatrist and psychologist regularly.

Basically, a couple of years ago I started listening to a podcast created by a bloke who is autistic. How he describes his autism is very similar to some of my ADHD symptoms. I ran the idea that I might be autistic past my both psychs and neither thought I was so I left it there.

At the beginning of the year I got into a new relationship and my girlfriend became certain that I was autistic as I dazzled her with my extensive knowledge of niche facts and statistics. She got me to do a bloom quiz which said I was on the spectrum but honestly I didn’t think much of it.

More recently I was talking to my psychologist and he was asking me the origin of my internal social and relationship rules. I was able to tell him the exact origin on which he suggested we take some autism tests. He sent me 3 different tests and the result on all 3 was that I was conclusively on the spectrum but really only just.

I guess I say all that to ask for someone like me is this worth pursuing with my psychiatrist for an official diagnosis? I’m very deep on the spectrum for ADHD so I understand how the diagnosis helps treatment but is there treatment for autism when one is only ‘just’ on the spectrum?

This is a genuine question and I apologize in advance if the tone is off. I’m definitely not trying to minimize anyone’s experience other than my own lol. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for sharing your experience and thoughts.";;;;
2025-10-17 15:53:14;Quarter life crisis;"Hi everyone.

 

I hope this post doesn't come off as too whiny or anything like that. I'm just looking for advice and to see if I can find others who can relate. And I also just really need a place to vent.

 

I'll turn 25 in a few days. 

I grew up, like most, with a lot of expectations hoisted upon me. 

Society expects certain things from us, and often so does everyone close to us as well. 

My parents made it very clear what was expected from me, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. 

I was expected to stand above the pack. To be reasonably handsome, reasonably athletic, intelligent, knowledgeable, fairly popular and good with people, to have a good well-paying job, to own nice tings, to have a spouse or a SO with similar qualities, and a group of charming and successful friends.

 

As a child I was at least in the ballpark of achieving some of these things. But slowly, as I grew older, having all this became more and more of a distant prospect. I was able to force myself to fit into the mold previously, regardless of how uncomfortable I always felt deep down, but when adolescence came, it all started slipping away from me, and I could no longer bare to hold on.

 

No one in my family wanted to recognize this, especially not my dad. Only my mom began to see how badly I struggled socially, my many eccentricities and my lacking off goal and direction. She had no real advice or help to give, but she at least saw what I was going through and hoped I'd grow out of it.

When I turned 18, I had become a loner, I had no friends, bad grades and no plan. She convinced me to seek psychiatric help, and I wound up being diagnosed with autism.

 

A lot of years have past since then and unfortunately; I'm still as lost now as I was back then.

The expectations of the past weigh upon me very badly, it's getting unbearable.

I've become an extremely insecure person, with a constant feeling of inadequacy wherever I go or do. I feel it every time I interact with anyone, especially those in my family, the only people I'm somewhat close to. 

 

The last few years I´ve spent desperately trying to reach what those around me always wanted me to. Though this is coming at the expense of my sanity and happiness. After everyday of striving I get home feeling completely empty and hopeless, feeling stuck in a meaningless pursuit. I feel like I´ll crash and burn continuing like this, in the end never getting to where I´m trying to go, or I´ll eventually reach my goals only to find the same feeling of hollowness I´ve always felt reaching for them, ending up empty and confused, living with the knowledge of having spent all this time and energy on something  that wasn´t worth it.

I don´t even know if having all these things is something I want, or if I´m just desperately trying to make others around me impressed and proud. I just know that at no point trying to get them do I feel any joy or sense of satisfaction.

I've reached a true impasse in life. 

I either go on like this or I finally let go and try to find other ways of achieving a meaningful and happy life with the risk of severely disappointing the people around me and perhaps finding the less conventional path to difficult and ending up a failure. Though this feels extremely difficult, as I would let go of the only life I know and identity I have. I´m clueless as how I should move forward.

 

To anyone who reads this, regardless if you have any thing to share or not, I just want to say, I sincerely hope everything works out for you and that you get want you want and need in the end, I´m rooting for you.";;;;
2025-10-17 15:41:13;The meaninglessness of life as a source of unmasking and inner calm;"TL;DR Accepting that life has no inherent meaning brings me calm and clarity: not depression, but relief in being authentic.

Since I was a teenager, I’ve believed that life doesn’t really have inherent meaning, and that’s always felt grounding and oddly calming. It’s not sadness or depression (though I was diagnosed with depression back then), but a kind of acceptance. I used to talk about this openly, but people took it as negativity or lack of ambition, which led me to close up more and more, realising my difference. That sense of disconnection and hopelessness eventually led to my mental health diagnosis. Some friends not understood but accepted my life view (by some I mean two), but mosr didn’t which, along with the diagnosis, pushed me to mask.

After school, not being the “popular one”, starting work, and moving around made things harder. Meeting new people felt necessary to avoid loneliness, but connecting was exhausting. I took on too much to prove myself, yet still felt like an outsider. Over time, I’ve found a few weird, thoughtful souls, people who appreciate my questioning nature and don’t expect constant positivity, compliments to feel better or frequent contact.

Now, with my ADHD diagnosis and waiting for my autism assessment, a lot starts to make sense: the masking, overthinking, the pressure to appear upbeat in a world that is mostly performing (and can well be a mere simulation with “coding” issues!). Letting go of the idea that life needs meaning has made it easier to live honestly and conserve energy for what actually feels real.

I’m also in a relationship with a neurotypical boyfriend from a different cultural and religious background. It’s taken a lot of adjusting, but being open about our differences instead of forcing our relationship to fit social expectations has brought us closer. He’s been through trauma and finds calm in how I see things, while helping me as my “social and emotional brain.” It’s not always easy, but it feels genuine, like we’re creating our own version of connection.

Sharing this in case it resonates with anyone, especially those who find peace not in searching for meaning, but in letting go of it.";;;;

I take it around 8am and after about 4 hours my heart pounds very rapidly, I lose appetite, and I feel very tired but can't fall asleep. I heard that one of the side effects of my medication is heart palpitations, and I was wondering if anyone else has an experience like mine.;;;;
2025-10-17 10:21:02;Can anyone relate? I feel like I'm on the spectrum but I don't know how to really go about it or if I'm even right;"Hi people! I strongly feel like I am on the autism spectrum, but I just don't know how to go about it. There are a lot of traits associated with autism (and OCD) that I resonate with, and if I look at my life through the spectrum, my life just makes sense. My mom said that when I was a child, my teachers and the principal thought I was mute. It seems I chose not to speak at school, and while I had friends, I often spent my time alone. I remember I always preferred spending my lunch time in my teacher's classroom, where I would play board games by myself or just read. At home or at church, I did speak, though, and I was a chatterbox when it came to my interests. To this day, I struggle with this. I get extremely anxious when around people, and especially when I'm in big, crowded spaces or when I have to speak. I sometimes freeze when I have to speak, and often have delayed responses. I also find it hard to know when to speak because I often can't ""read the room,"" or I just feel like my thoughts don't translate to words. 

I'm hypersensitive to sounds, and I have to wear noise-canceling earplugs when I go to places like church because of the music and the talking, and I have to wear headphones when I'm on the train and commuting to work because of all the noises. I refuse to use silverware because the sound and touch stress me. I cannot stand the sound, and I cannot handle my teeth or tongue touching silverware. I get physically distressed with this sound, as well as with cabinets and doors being slammed, loud music, screaming or loud talking, and I also hate touching or seeing wet food. I have to remove myself from where I am or put headphones on, or else I end up exploding on people when they make these noises. I don't like people touching me, except for my mom. I don't like being physically affectionate with people because it makes me uncomfortable, and the feeling of someone touching me is not pleasant. It makes me feel overwhelmed and like I want to climb out of my skin. 

I force myself to make eye contact with people, maybe a little too much, and I rehearse things A LOT, but I feel like I do it because it helps me feel...normal? Maybe it makes me feel more socially acceptable? I don't know. I absolutely despise socializing, unless it's centered around topics I'm super interested in. I struggle with this at work because they try to invite me to lunch and social gatherings all the time, and I just don't want to or feel comfortable doing it. 

Anyways. I just feel like I've mentioned this to my doctor, but never directly mentioned suspecting I was on the spectrum. I think I struggle a lot with masking because I've always been called awkward and boring, and I have always found it difficult to make friends. I also feel like it temporarily helps me manage my anxiety and stress, but when I get home and go to my room, I feel so drained, and I have a hard time thinking about what parts of me are the real me and what parts are not. I just don't know how to approach this. I'm not dying for a diagnosis, but I think someone believing me or confirming it would help me understand myself better. Can anyone relate?";;;;

2025-10-17 07:33:51;Being diagnosed at an older age;"Hi everyone,

I’m not sure if this is the right place to bring this up, but recently I decided to get tested for ADD, as I’ve become quite certain I might have it. I was hoping that getting a diagnosis could help me understand and manage some of my focus and social difficulties.

My GP suggested I first speak with a kind of pre-psychologist before starting the full diagnostic process, since that can take a long time and be quite expensive, even with insurance. The person I spoke to, however, thought I might not only have ADD, but also autism.

I’m 30 now, and I’ve never really felt the need for a diagnosis before, even though I’ve suspected ADD for a while. I didn’t expect to want to know—but the more the guy explained about autism, the more it started to make sense.

The issue is that the actual diagnosis process could take more than a year because of long waiting lists here. The person I spoke to recommended that I try connecting with others who might have similar experiences, especially people around my age.

So I wanted to ask: are there people here who discovered they’re autistic later in life? How did you deal with it? What helped you most? And did you try medication—and if so, did you feel it made a positive difference? I’ve heard mixed things about it, but if it could help me feel better, improve my focus, and help socially, I’d definitely consider it.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their experience.";;;;

2025-10-17 05:15:52;How do i come to terms with my diagnosis?;"(English isn’t my first language so i apologize if there’s any mistakes) 
I don’t know if this is the right place to ask, but i couldn’t find anywhere else. 
I turned 18 years old this week and i just got diagnosed with something called ""mixed specific developmental disorder"". It’s basically means that i have developmental delays that affect multiple areas like speech, motor function and scholastic skills. It has apparently followed me my whole life without anyone noticing up until my second year of high school, where my teacher noticed that something was up and helped me get sent to a psychologist to seek a diagnosis. Is there any way that i can come to terms with this and just accept that i’m probably going to be this way forever? All my life i’ve had the feeling that i’m just stupid and thought that i just learn really slowly compared to others. This obviously fucked up my self-confidence to the point where i straight up started refusing to let teachers see my work in class (still do tbh), because i either hadn’t started since i didn’t understand or because i was scared of doing it wrong. I also have a REALLY bad stutter and i speak really fast (probably because of this), which makes me dread any presentation or spoken assignment to the point where i have on multiple occasions begged my teachers to let me do something else or skip it. I still do this because it’s almost impossible for me to form a coherent sentence at times, and i hate being this way. I honestly don’t know how i’m just gonna accept it, so i really need some good advice right now.";;;;
2025-10-17 03:58:22;OCD and ADHD?;Hi, this is really just to get other peoples opinions and maybe see if other people have these same problems, because this really makes me feel completely isolated as no one I know really understands. For backstory and context I’m a 21 y/o male and a few years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, and am on meds for that. The reasoning for the diagnosis was that I have a tendency to hyperfixate on certain things, which makes people think i’m very smart but I fail to remember basic tasks, but outside of those things I have a complete lack of motivation to do anything else, but I am constantly having anxiety about not doing the things I wanted to. For example cleaning is a hard one for me, I constantly have a lack of motivation to clean, and then I get anxiety about not cleaning which then makes it even harder to start and it’s just a loop from there, same case with other things cleaning is just my biggest. My doctor stated it’s executive dysfunction, and i’m on Focalin and it does help for the most part, but the real question I have here is, whenever i’m in a room by myself I constantly feel like someone’s either behind me or watching me from somewhere in the room, once this thought hits my head I just spiral into a panic attack every single time, and I start “seeing” people walking out of my peripheral, I say “seeing” because it’s not like actual hallucinations, I just think I see them. I also cannot sleep with a door cracked open, they all have to be closed, I constantly check my locks to make sure they’re closed even though i remember locking the door. I’m kinda rambling and listing symptoms but I just have no clue if i’m overthinking this or if this is a common thing, but it’s actively affecting my work life because I primarily work in buildings with no one in them and I can sometimes go for like a hour or two but once I get the feeling that somethings behind me I just spiral, and the only way to even try and calm me down is usually by repeating like song lyrics or whatever the first thing that pops in my head. I’m currently in the process of getting a therapist to talk to about this but I am just so on edge all the time because of this, and I have done some research on these symptoms and from what I understand it points towards OCD, but I also don’t really like self diagnosing and just want to get some opinions on this.;;;;
2025-10-17 03:28:56;Autistic struggles of adult life in general;Hi everyone, i got my diagnosis about 3 to 4 months ago, though i have a job, in process of graduating from college, i still struggle, yes, i do still struggle, although i am in a position where i feel its quite nice for someone in their 24 yo, in times of crisis i still feel like the plan, whatever that means, is not working, and i feel like i need to re-plan everything for my life to be perfect 5 years from now, its absurd that sometimes theres not written rules of how to deal with certain shit, i have a job that lets me work from home, but its not part of my special interest, it is something that i like though, i just dont know how to let life happen, besides having sort of an explanation, i know not so deep inside, theres not an explicit split between me and autistic me, i know its just part of the mix that makes me, theres just too many areas where i feel like things dont come natural to me because it depends on heuristics that most people seem to just get it somehow, i wont even get me talking about love life, im just afraid, because im realizing life is just something that i have to make it myself, and i just realized i have to figure it out along the way, without being certain of the end;;;;
2025-10-17 03:02:32;Has anyone else been called selfish, awful, or narcissistic even when they’re trying their best?;"Hi everyone,

I’m 37, diagnosed with autism when I was 4. I’ve been struggling lately with something that’s really tearing me apart emotionally.

I recently lost a close friend — someone I loved and cared about deeply — and it’s left me questioning everything. I know I have issues with attachment and trust, and sometimes I react in ways I wish I didn’t. I never mean to hurt anyone, but when I care about someone, I feel things so intensely that it can overwhelm me and others around me.

I honestly don’t know how else to express just how distraught and grief-stricken I am right now. I’ve never been told such painful things before — that I’m selfish, that I trauma dump, that I manipulate people, that I’m narcissistic, and even that my family has failed me because I “need better help.” He even asked me if I treat everyone like this, or if I just choose to be awful with him. Hearing that broke me in ways I can’t even describe.

I’ve also heard things from him that I never thought I’d hear from someone I cared about. There were tears and anger on both sides, and it felt like everything spiraled out of control. The situation was overwhelming and frightening for me. There was yelling, banging, and a lot of chaos, and I felt completely scared and unsafe in the moment. Experiencing that has left me shaken and replaying it over and over, and it’s added to the grief and confusion I’m already feeling.

He said things that made me feel like I was being blamed for hurting him in ways I never would, and that completely broke me. I would never intentionally hurt anyone — least of all someone I love. Hearing that kind of pain directed at me left me feeling scared, guilty, and heartbroken all at once.

The truth is, I don’t act like this toward anyone else. It’s because I loved him. I don’t know how autistic people usually experience love, but for me, love makes me feel everything more — it’s raw, consuming, and sometimes it makes me act out of fear of losing that person. I’m not proud of it, and I don’t want to be this way, but it’s like the emotions are so big that I can’t always handle them the way I should.

Lately, I’ve been telling myself that maybe I’m just not a good person — that maybe people really don’t deserve me in their lives. But even when I try to express that pain, when I cry or say how much I hate myself for how things went, I get told to “stop it” or “stop crying.” I wish I could. I wish I could just stop feeling like this. But I can’t. It hurts too much.

I’m trying to take responsibility for my actions, but I’m also questioning whether I really am this awful person I’ve been told I am — or if I just need people who understand me better. I feel completely gaslit and confused, like my whole sense of self has been shaken.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Feeling like you’re always the one who’s misunderstood or blamed, even when your intentions come from love or care? How do you deal with being told such painful things about yourself when you’re already trying your best?

I’m not here to trash anyone or get pity. I just want to understand myself better and hear from others who’ve maybe felt the same way. Because right now, I feel completely lost, and I just need to know if I’m not alone.";;;;
2025-10-17 02:45:31;Autism questions.;"I was a late diagnosis. 
With autism and taking everything literally. Is it normal to misunderstand a legal question? ";;;;
2025-10-17 02:33:55;Very weird therapy sessions to diagnose ND;"Hey all, I've recently started some sessions with a psychologist who specialises in ND to check if I have some flavour of ND, after being in psychoanalysis for around 6 years (I love the rational part of it)

I was really expecting these ND-diagnosis sessions to be very ""structured"", with tests, questionnaires, specific questions, etc, but my therapist asked me to answer a quick questionnaire about some habits (10 minutes), then he sent a similar questionnaire to my ex-therapist (what he calls a Hetero-Anamnestic questionnaire) and that was about it.

But now all our sessions (we're in the sixth one) feel like just regular psychology sessions - I talk about my week, some things that have bothered me, what feelings it caused in me, and how I reacted. It all feels very ""unstructured"", and he keeps asking me questions about recent events, barely mentioning more specific ND-diagnosis dynamics. I also leave the sessions feeling very weird, because we mostly talk about things in my week which created discomfort in me, and I usually try to navigate these things as they happen and then let them go, it's incredibly uncomfortable to go over them again and again over the hour of session. I leave the sessions feeling super heavy

I kind of asked him yesterday about this, and he said he ""needs to have these unstructured sessions to try and understand what flavour of ND"" I have. But I'm starting to get suspicious that he might not know what he's doing.

**My question for you peeps is:** to whoever already has a diagnosis, what was your experience with your therapist? Does the above experience relate to yours, was it similar? If not, how was yours, and does mine feel off somehow?

\------

tl;dr - I'm suspicious my therapist doesn't quite know how to diagnose ND, and I'm leaving the sessions feeling super heavy and uncomfortable, not knowing if we're advancing in a diagnosis or not";;;;
2025-10-17 02:33:41;Misdiagnosed as Bipolar 2 but actually just AuDHD?;"If so, you’re not alone. 

I was diagnosed as autistic as a kid but one could never be diagnosed also as ADHD where I grew up until about 10 years ago. So for my entire teens and twenties and early thirties, I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2 - because autism and BP2 look a lot like AuDHD. 

Lo and behold, I was off my meds for a month and nothing happened. Went into the doctor circa 2016 and BOOM - ADHD, not bipolar. A whole part of how I saw myself for a good 20 years disappeared in a moment. Bizarre feeling. ";;;;
2025-10-17 01:44:28;When you get bullied for being quiet;"I've always been a really quiet person. From childhood to adulthood, it's the way I have always been. There is nothing wrong with being quiet, more reserved, having an introverted personality and preferring to keep to yourself. But some people will not be nice to you, or pick on you, because you are quiet. I experienced this frequently as a child and teenager when I went to school. I attended the same school, for years. A small school in the mountains, where the kids who were considered cool pretty much decided who was cool enough to hang out with them and who would be excluded. Anyone different was excluded. Didn't matter if you were intelligent and in advanced classes. It didn't matter if you were a really nice person and wanted to make friends. If you were considered different, by the way you dressed, by being really shy, by having hobbies different from the popular kids, if you were extremely smart and studied. But a big thing all the popular kids at my school really disliked and would instantly single you out for was if you were really quiet. I was really quiet and shy. I still am this way. 

And these kids, who I basically saw every single day at school, and couldn't escape their bullying, would go after me, for not talking. I was diagnosed with autism at age 14. Because it was such a small school, people knew who the kids with disabilities were. There were only two autistic kids in the school. Me and another student who was a few years younger than me. There were deaf children as well. In my class, I was the only autistic student and it was obvious to those around me, as much as I tried to mask at school. My mother always made sure I had accommodations and special learning classes, so I would have the best help available. I loved certain classes, like drama and creative writing. I did not like the classes that had a lot of the kids in it that weren't nice to me. Because it was the perfect opportunity for any of them to bully me and say something mean. The accommodations my mom got me in school made learning easier. I had classes where I was the only student, I got individual attention and was able to learn at my own pace, without feeling rushed. The teachers in my special learning classes always listened to me and validated how I felt. Nobody could pick on me during these classes

It was not just kids at the school who bullied me for being quiet. Several of the teaches, who should have known better, would say rude things to me because of how quiet I was. I would be walking down the hall and walk past two of the teachers. One of the teachers turned to the other teacher and said in a mocking tone,, ""Does she ever talk?"" He said it right as I walked by so he wanted me to hear it. I never understood why people felt the need to be mean to me because I was quiet. I was a good student, never got into trouble and didn't have a particular group I hung out with. This made me stand out, where a lot of the kids had different friend groups. I basically didn't belong to any group. But I found comfort in my creative writing and drama classes. In the drama class I took, it was the only class where no one bullied me. There were only four kids in the class. In creative writing class, the class I looked forward to, was where children could be especially cruel

Not only did the kids in my creative writing class mock me for being quiet, they would criticize me for my writing abilities. Writing has always been my special interest. Not only did I love to write in school, I spent every day after school writing and designing my own books, which the other children didn't realize I was doing. Writing wasn't just an activity, to me. It was the thing that got me through difficult times, something that made me feel not alone. I was really proud of a story I had worked on for creative writing class. I stood up and read the story in front of the class. Several kids clapped and told me I did a great job. The kids who were really mean tried to embarrass me and take me down a few pegs, by blurting out loudly, in front of everyone, that there is no way I could have written that story. I didn't really understand why those kids felt the need to be rude to me when I loved to write, and just wanted to share my idea with the class. But I held my head high, in times where the words spoken to me by other children still wounded my soul greatly. 

Sometimes, the bullying would get to me, and after I got off the bus after school, I would be in tears from the bullying and the name calling.  Every day, before school, I felt a knot in my stomach as I prepared to enter the school building. I was prepared to be insulted simply for preferring to sit by myself and draw in my notebook. While the popular kids would goof off, talk loudly and act like they were better than everyone. Their favorite thing was to try to provoke me into talking more. The way they did is they would ask me questions like ""Why are you always so quiet?"" They wanted me to respond, or get me so upset, to cause me to react. I often didn't answer or insult them back, because I didn't see the point. I knew to be so mean to me, for absolutely no reason, that these were kids that I didn't want to be friends with. I wanted friends, but not with the people who were never going to accept me as one of them anyway. None of these kids ever extended a hand, apologized, or asked me about my other interests. They shunned me, from day one and formed their own opinions, deciding I was ""too weird"" or ""too quiet"" to be friends with them. They did this to other children too. They bullied the smart kids, who enjoyed studying. And they bullied kids who had moved there from different schools and they decided they didn't like them, for any reason

But I was targeted constantly, simply for the fact that I was quiet and it was extremely hurtful. It confused me as I was just being myself. I wasn't pretending to be a certain way so they would like me. I loved to write and I loved studying and focusing on my school work. And I wouldn't hide this fact from them, to boost their egos. The kids who were considered the leaders of the group always had to outshine everyone with everything they did. Sports, school work, being the center of attention whenever there was an activity. Their egos would get bruised if someone was extremely creative in a certain subject, like art or writing. If someone had excellent math skills. If someone was great at school projects and assignments. If one of the popular kids succeeded in sports, schoolwork, or any other activity, they were praised and validated. But the kids who weren't considered popular were never validated in that way. You could receive praise if you did a good job on something sometimes from other kids. But it was generally kids who who weren't bullies. There were nice kids, polite kids, popular with the other children,  who didn't call other people names. I liked talking to them. But the extroverted, rude and popular children outnumbered these other children

And so if you can imagine being an extremely shy, quiet girl, with no close friends, who was good at writing and worked really hard in school, walking into this lion's den, every day, for years. With the same people. Who's opinions of me were based on nothing other than their assumptions. Yes, I was very quiet. But at home, where I was more comfortable and around my family, I was able to relax and be myself. But in school, I learned from an early age that you didn't really have to say anything for other children to mistreat you. As a way to protect myself, I never revealed personal information about myself to the mean kids I was around. I didn't tell them about the hours after school I spent every day, writing my books. I didn't tell them about my interests, my hobbies or anything like that. They only knew I liked writing because they saw how I would turn in a really detailed writing assignment every time and work hard on my own poetry. They had no idea how much I loved drama, because in that class, none of the kids who mocked me for being quiet, were in that class. It was just me and three other girls, who were nice to me. 

I never heard another student step in to defend me, saying ""Leave her alone."" But I did hear one of the teachers join in on the bullying. By saying ""She won't talk. Don't bother asking her any questions. She doesn't speak."" I would internalize the rude comments, go back home and feel bad. I would tell my mom sometimes about the bullying and one time, she did intervene when a couple of girls were particularly mean to me one day. She stood up for me, and maybe if I talked to her more about the bullying I experienced, she would have tried to help. But I often just kept it to myself

I will never understand people who pick on others for being different. Whether it's because you are quiet, or shy. Or whether you have a hobby that's different from others. Or whether it's because you are more introverted and prefer to do things your way. I have always valued staying true to myself. I wanted to belong, at school. But nothing made me want to give up my integrity, just to be liked. I never became more extroverted. I never went from quiet to outgoing. I will always be a person who's reserved. I prefer to communicate through writing and it's where my voice truly shines. But I am glad I have my family and people in my life I can open up to when I have a problem. I wish I had close friends in school. But I will always remember the way I was singled out and bullied, for being different

Being different can be beautiful. Others may not always be willing or able to see the positive things about you. Other people may never accept you, no matter how hard you try. There are bullies in the world, people who have to hurt others to feel better about themselves. There are also kind and compassionate people, who listen to and respect you. Those are the people that matter. ";;;;
2025-10-16 23:52:06;Would level 1 people diagnosed in 2013 and level 2 autistic people be more likely to struggle with explaining artist's intention in college level art courses?;"My understanding of the literature is yes because back then for many (most?) level 1 and for level 2 today we often see trouble with NT style abstract reasoning, cognitive empathy along with other factors.  There were a lot of parent websites, informational guides, and academic journals in the 2000s and early 2010s that talked a lot about us being hyperliteral, missing the forest for the trees, having trouble with abstract thinking, being too logical etc.


Today's level 1 people are less likely to have cognitive issues apart from social communication issues so they are less likely to encounter difficulties explaining art using lessons learned in course provided IQ and/or academic achievement is at least average. However, when they encounter art that focuses on body language then that will be hard unless the subjects are autistic perhaps.

Mainly checking my knowledge here but also wondering if you had any experiences/observations of the above I described";;;;
2025-10-16 23:47:05;Wuld you use this app?;"Hi everyone,

I was recently diagnosed with Asperger’s / ASD Level 1, and I’m taking a course called *Usability and Accessibility*, where our project is to create an app or website that helps people with disabilities.

After thinking about what I personally struggle with and what I’d find helpful, I came up with the idea of an app where you can **input routines**, and each step is represented visually as **a stage in the growth of a flower**, so you can see your progress. Eventually, I’d like to add a “garden” where you can view all the routines completed each day.

I’d really appreciate any suggestions or ideas for features that might be useful for autistic people. I love programming, so even if this project is just for class, I plan to keep refining it afterward.";;;;
2025-10-16 23:13:58;Is it worth getting formally diagnosed?;"**TLDR. If I'm 99% sure I'm on the autism spectrum, is it worth getting formally assessed, or should I just seek treatment as if that were the case? would a formal diagnosis help separate out ""depression"" from ""Bipolar Depression"" from ""Autism""?**

Now - I'm 30, and I think I've learned to mask very well since then, but now at 30, I've come to a complete burnout, life grinding halt.

Family history - My youngest brother is formally diagnosed as ""high-functioning autistic"", and he and I are very similar. We also suspect my dad, who's very ""special interest"" based, very socially reclusive, as being ""asperger's"". on his side, all of our cousins are very ""weird"". ADHD, etc.

Me - I had distinct social integration problems with other kids when I was elementary-middle school aged. From I was 6-10, we have family videos of me sleepwalking and doing toe-walking while flapping my hands. I had a lot of tactile issues with clinging fabrics - couldn't wear socks/shoes, pants, and I still can't wear underwear to this day (always go commando). At \~10 years old, I remember my parents took me to a child PT who brushed the bottom of my feet - I think that was to desensitize me to wearing shoes?

I nurture a lot of self-soothing special interests in life science docs. I'm very fact and information seeking. I have very deep interest in history and archaeology, biology, humanities. I love to spout off everything I know. I know a little something about almost everything, to an unusual degree, compared to most of my friends - just b/c I'm so data-collecting oriented. I basically can't watch real human TV or film b/c it's too emotionally draining and overwhelming - I prefer to watch long university lectures on youtube. Lol

Depression - I have run on a unipolar major depression diagnosis for the last 10 years. The last 3 years I've had 3 psychs give me a bipolar II diagnosis. But I really don't get crazy hypomania. Only once or twice have I felt like i bordered into real hypomania, and even then it's very brief. I am usually just caught in months to years long total life-ruining depressive slumps. My mom did recently get a Bipolar II diagnosis too. She's not autistic-ish, I don't think, but has always had mood problems, and I think she's actually BPD as well (or instead of BP2).";;;;
2025-10-16 22:56:11;Just got my assessment yesterday;"Hello everyone!

I just finished my assessment yesterday, and I was diagnosed with Autism type 1. 
I was already previously diagnosed with ADHD and I had several friends tell me to get assessed for Autism. 
I still dont know how to feel about it. I almost feel shame? Like somehow I did this to myself. Like I somehow lied and got the diagnosis, or that I shouldn't have found out because now this changes everything. 

Also a sense of irony because my ex was so against Autism and drilled into me that it was the worst thing you can be. He literally left his ex before me because her brother had it and he didnt want his kids to have autism, only to marry me. (Divorced w/ no kids btw)

I guess i want to know if anyone else felt this way once diagnosed and how do you handle it? ";;;;
2025-10-16 22:17:09;My mom keeps suggesting that I am autistic because I am overweight and I cannot put up with this anymore;"I am a teenager and I am currently undergoing evaluation for autism and ADHD. I'm a few sessions in with my psychologist and it has been established that I have strong autistic traits. Throughout this, my parents have been as unsupportive as they possibly can be. They only take me to psychologist appointments to make me stop complaining about sensory issues.

I am overweight but not obese. My mom seems to think that my autistic traits are caused by me being ""obese"". My mom has always been insecure of the fact that I am overweight. She body shames me constantly and keeps telling me that I'll stop having autistic traits if I lose weight. She also keeps suggesting that I should loose weight to ""look prettier"" and ""look like an actress"". I think it's also important to mention that she thinks psychologists and doctors are scammers.

I genuinely do not know how to deal with this nonsense and her constant body shaming. I really need a diagnosis to get accommodations and other things but I cannot put up with this anymore.";;;;
2025-10-16 21:54:45;will I be the only one?;"When I was a child, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, but in a form that apparently isn't common: My condition is ""much less"" than usual, which leaves me in a state of limbo.

I have both ND and NT qualities: I have topics that interest me especially, but I can easily avoid dwelling on those topics when they arise. Also, in social interactions, I can partially differentiate when something is a joke and when there's a hidden or subconscious meaning in others, and I can have a normal, fluid conversation with another person to a certain extent.

However, there's a problem: Although I can do all of these things, it's not like that all the time, and I can generally tend to misinterpret, not know how to converse, go on too long, and even get stuck in my head for long periods of time.

It's as if there's a small leak where things escape me, and I don't know where it is or how to fix it. It feels awful knowing that there are days I can act partially like a NT and other days I'm simply mired in despair for not being able to act or think that way.

To top it all off, my family and colleagues insist that ""I have nothing"" and that I can just ""act normal"" and ""stop being dramatic,"" when the reality is that I don't really know who I am and it doesn't seem like anyone really cares, despite trying.";;;;
2025-10-16 21:18:17;Exploring whether or not I'm autistic (long);"I’m 46 years old and just coming to the realization that I may have autism!

Welcome to my TED Talk. I’m sorry this is so long. There is a TLDR at the end for anyone who doesn’t want to read my wall of text (pls someone read my wall of text). Also this is a throwaway account because idk if I want to tell my friends yet.

So this all kicked off the other day when my (46 M) wife (43 F) reminded me of somewhere we were supposed to go. I don’t remember exactly where, but I remember it was something I wasn’t interested in and didn’t want to go to. This happens a lot for me.
 
During our conversation, she told me “I don’t want you to get mad about it, just come with me.” 
I told her my standard line of “I can’t guarantee I won’t get mad, but I’ll still come with you.” 
She asked “Why do you do that? Why do you get angry over simple things I ask you to do?”
I didn’t have an answer, so I decided to look into it. I think the answer is I might be autistic. Not only do I think I’m autistic, but I think my parents might have known and kept it from me.

Researching all this triggered a specific memory for me. I can remember my mom bringing us home from school and being angry. She was ranting about doctors just wanting to push pills on kids to keep them quiet. The entire situation was unusual for us. My mom picking us up from school almost never happened unless we came home early sick. We always rode the bus. Her anger wasn’t new, but usually she took her anger out on the person that made her angry. Generalized rants weren’t really her thing. Not wanting to anger her further, I just kinda disappeared into my room to play video games or read or whatever while she got it out of her system. That must have been 35 or 40 years ago now, but this is really the first time I’ve thought about it since.

I know a lot of non-autistic people can have similar traits as autistic people, but during my research, I had many many autistic traits resonate with me.

**Social anxiety and confusion about social norms.** I dislike leaving the house because I dislike being around people I don’t know. I feel like I don’t know how to act around individual people until I’ve spoken with them a good bit and crowds just absolutely send me over the edge. I remember once my wife and I went to a new Trader Joe’s opening. The place was so crowded it was like being stuck in stop and go traffic just trying to get down an aisle, any aisle. I told my wife I’d wait for her in the car and walked out without waiting for her response because I just couldn’t be in that situation. She followed me out mad and disappointed. I tried to talk her into going back in and letting me wait in the car, but she just told me to go so we left. I’m also hypervigilant in social situations, worrying about what people (especially strangers) think about me. I’m getting better, but damn it’s stressful.

**Scripted conversations.** In my work, I regularly come into contact with strangers. Currently I’m a security guard working at a truck gate, but I spent 15 years as a Sheriff’s Deputy and 10 before that working retail. I always have a script ready for common situations. When a truck rolls up to my gate, I’ll tell the driver hello or good morning/afternoon. I’ll ask if they’re picking up or delivering. I’ll tell them to drive to the Shipping/Receiving office and that the ladies in there will get the driver to where they need to be. When a truck leaves, I do my usual inspection (either the load is sealed or it's an empty truck), I’ll check their paperwork, and I’ll tell the driver to have a good day and be safe. 

**Eye contact.** I don’t do it. It’s uncomfortable and I just look at people’s nose or mouth or act like I’m focused on writing something down or anything else. I even have trouble making eye contact with my wife and we’ve been married almost 20 years.

**Empathy.** If something sad is on TV or I feel bad for someone, I will cry at the drop of a hat. If someone is embarrassed in real life, I feel intense embarrassment for them. I can’t watch people be embarrassed on TV without feeling their embarrassment. Oddly, relating back to social confusion, I try not to crack jokes at or about people (though I sometimes fail). I’ve learned that some things I find funny are considered in bad taste. My poor wife has accidentally been the butt of a few jokes of mine that I just didn’t understand why she got upset afterward. I always apologize, but it takes a few minutes for me to process why she might get upset, and then when I get it, I get upset with myself for her.

**Emotional meltdowns.** OMG at the number of meltdowns I had as a kid, even up to my early 20s. I never understood them, but if anything big in my life changed (it didn’t have to be a big thing, just something I considered big) I would melt down. I remember losing my shit once when my favorite radio station changed formats from Alt Rock to Top 40. My dad and brother both looked at me like I’d gone crazy. There were quite a few things like that that have happened over the years. I remember desperately wanting to learn to play the saxophone in High School, but being absolutely petrified to try to play in front of people. A friend who played offered to help me and while I was playing, I just absolutely broke down crying because I was actually playing decently. He asked why I was crying and I had no idea.

**Masking, mirroring, and people pleasing.** I don’t really know if these are the same thing, but they feel similar to me. I remember very vividly a friend telling me that he enjoyed my company because I was easy to talk to. I asked him what made me easy to talk to and he told me that I was good at mirroring other people’s personalities so I felt very relatable. I also always have this need for people around me to like me, even if I don’t like them very much. It’s gross and embarrassing, but I tend towards just giving people a smile and nod even if they say or do something I disagree with. Politics would be an example. I’ve always been a bit of a centrist, but with the rise of MAGA, I’ve just found myself more and more of a Democrat. I’ve gotten better about making them know I disagree with them, but I still catch myself couching my language in passive terms because I want them to like me. I will do everything I can to avoid those people after interactions like that, and if I can’t avoid them, then I try to steer the conversation away from anything I find disagreeable. 

**Executive Functioning.** I don’t even know if I know how to explain this. If I have something to do later, I have trouble doing anything productive until that point in the day. An example would be if I have a doctor’s appointment at 1 PM. Until I go to my doctor’s appointment, I just can’t do anything else except maybe watch TV or read. It doesn’t matter what time it is either. I usually wake up between 4 and 5 AM, and that 1 PM doctor’s appointment will keep me from getting anything done for most of the day. Especially if I know that I won’t be able to finish whatever it is I decide to do prior to the doctor’s appointment.

**Stimming.** I feel a little confused about what stimming is beyond physical motions. I catch myself stroking my beard, tapping my foot, or playing with random things around my desk a good bit. Beyond that though, I also find myself silently repeating things I’ve said to other people over and over. Sometimes I’m trying to figure out if that was the right thing to say in the moment or sometimes I just might be doing it subconsciously and not realize I’m doing it until someone points it out (is that stimming?). 

**Something different that I’m not sure how to categorize.** It’s possible it’s some form of stimming but I will start and restart a game over and over and over again. I don’t know how many times I’ve restarted a game of Civilization 5 or Baldur’s Gate 3 to play through the openings only to restart maybe an hour later because I see something else in the game that would be cool to try. I have thousands of hours in Civ5 and have probably only ever finished a handful of games. I have over 500 hours in BG3, and have only made it to Act 3 once, and never finished.

**Some other things I’ve seen referenced in relation to autism, but haven’t looked into a lot.** Toe walking: I saw someone reference this on a video as an autistic trait. I used to be bad about this and didn’t even know I was doing it most of the time. I’ve since stopped, but I suspect that’s more of a result of breaking my foot twice (same foot) and having poor balance as a result. Migraines: I’ve read that there is a link between migraines and autism. I’ve had migraines since I was 12, and they have always been something that has dominated my life and caused me a lot of problems. Small talk: Probably something to do with the social anxiety listed above. I have so much trouble with small talk. I will always talk about the weather if I have to do it because it’s something I’ve figured out everyone will talk about. 

**TLDR:** My wife asked me why I got angry about something, and I decided to look into it. I think I might be autistic. I also think my parents hid the fact that I’m autistic from me. I find so many autistic traits are things that make sense for why I do things I do. I’m 46 years old and just now figuring out what might be an answer to my question of why I always feel like I’m different from everyone else.

After reading all that (if you read all that thank you so much) are there any other common autistic traits I might look into that I may have missed or not mentioned? I’m open to exploring this more, I just need to figure out how to do that. I’m still trying to decide if I want to get an official diagnosis. ";;;;

2025-10-16 20:32:11;Struggling to make connections;Hi all. I was diagnosed this May at 31 years old and my diagnosis has answered a lot of questions but I am currently struggling with past childhood trauma and trying so desperately to move forward. One of the big things is not being able to make meaningful human connections, both romantic and platonic. My husband told me last night that I am currently a lot to handle which I suppose is fair because he is working through things with his job and family at the same time I am working through deep seeded family trauma. I tend to tell stories and my intention is not to unload for him to try and fix things or whatever, I just feel comfortable telling him things I havent told anyone before but now I feel like I cant talk to him. My therapist has been out of office due to medical things so I really feel as though I have no one...and to answer any questions about family no, I am currently not speaking with my family as it is not good for my mental health as I process the emotional neglect and unstable life I was raised in. I have always had a hard time socially but I truly dont know how to move forward and make meaningful connections...I cant rely on just my husband and therapist I guess through no fault of their own. Life happens I get that but when you have NO ONE other than those going through their own stuff and dont really have the capacity to be there fully for you, thats a lonely feeling and its overwhelming to say the least. Any advice would be lovely. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ;;;;
2025-10-16 20:31:28;Guess I’m out of here;"Five years ago, I was diagnosed with autism and it did a lot to contextualize many of my life experiences up to this point. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychosis three years ago. Recently, my psychiatrist referred me for a fresh psych evaluation. This one was much more thorough than the others I’ve done.

The results? My executive functioning is extremely bad and in the severe ADHD inattentive category. My social functioning is consistent with autism, but there was not sufficient evidence of restricted interests to validate that diagnosis.

The verdict? It’s schizophrenia.

I hate it. In terms of stigma, this is miles worse. It’s still socially acceptable to view schizophrenics as completely insane and potentially dangerous. I was comfortable telling a few people about my autism diagnosis, but the only people who will know about this are my wife and care team.

This doesn’t change the how much I relate to your experience, but I am not one of you and, therefore, I’ll be leaving this sub. I wish you all the best.

2025-10-16 19:40:12;I wrote about Leonardo da Vinci's ADHD as a historical trial - and it helped me understand my own brain;"For years I thought I was just lazy.   
Then I got diagnosed with ADHD as an adult.   
While researching, I discovered that Leonardo da Vinci showed every classic ADHD symptom - documented by his contemporaries 500 years ago:   
\- Started hundreds of projects, finished \~15   
\- His biographer **Vasari**: ""*He would begin many things, then abandon them*""   
\- **Pope Leo X**: ""*This man will never do anything, for he begins by thinking of the end before the beginning*""   
\- **Matteo Bandello** witnessed him giving ""*one or two brushstrokes"" to the Last Supper, then leaving for days""*  
I wrote this as a ""historical trial"" to prove neurodivergence isn't a modern trend, it's always existed, we just didn't understand it. If you've ever felt ""wrong"" your whole life before understanding why, this might resonate.

2025-10-16 14:01:09;how to get out of my own head and tell people that i'm probably autistic?;i'm almost 100% sure i have it, i've taken so many tests and scored higher than most autistic takers, i experience so much of the stuff that autistic people do, but i feel like i'm faking it just by saying it. i'm under 16 so i can't get a diagnosis without talking to my parents, specifically my mom. my dad was diagnosed with autism in the late 70s, and my mom suspects she has some form of ADHD and is diagnosed with dyslexia, but she does have a history of doubting me when i tell her these 'big' things about myself. i'm scared i don't actually have it and am just dramatic. i don't know what to do. i hope this makes sense :p;;;;
2025-10-16 12:27:01;Are diagnoses done by interns/students valid?;"I've been thinking of getting assessed but a session is so expensive so I've also been considering a cheaper option which is done by interns but I thought getting a diagnosis by an intern sounds off because I wouldn't ask for a medical student to write me a doctor's excuse note or something.

  
So, what are you guys' opinion on this?";;;;
2025-10-16 08:12:31;My first shutdown / burnout experience - and the follow up;"For some context, I was diagnosed with ADHD Combined as an adult after my executive coach recommended seeking behavioral therapy for some challenges I was having at work, but I’ve struggled with this issues since grade school.  I was prescribed medication and after some fine tuning I felt like it was a major breakthrough.  

Fast forward several years, I made the decision to resign from my company due to the direction the executive team / board decided to take, which was contrary to my recommendations based on data.  It was liberating, and I’m told caused quite the stir, although that was never my intention.  A few weeks later I thought I was having a heart attack or stroke and was taken to the ER.  After bloodwork, multiple scans, and evaluations, no heart attack or stroke.  When following up with my primary he mentioned ADHD burnout / shutdown which I had never heard of before.  

He recommended meeting with a neuropsychologist to talk through the events leading up to this point.  After a few sessions she asked if I had ever been tested for ASD.  I had not.  When I promptly asked why she pointed out my “repetitive behaviors, and social characteristics” lean towards ASD over ADHD and my shutdown symptoms post shutdown were also leaning towards ASD.  I was shocked.  When I told my wife, she didn’t seem surprised at all by her comment, which also shocked me.  Was I the only one who didn’t see certain things?  I believe my next step is to go in for a more formal evaluation, although I’m not exactly sure what a potential formal diagnosis brings to the table..

Has anyone here experienced anything similar?

2025-10-16 07:07:50;Severe/Worsening Uncoordination During Burnouts/Overstimulation;"At baseline I have always been someone who is easily overstimulated/overwhelmed. However, since I discharged from long term residential treatment, I found that my executive functioning became increasingly worse as I started having adult responsibilities (had recently turned 18) and in only a few months, I went from super ambitious, excited, and always responsible to feeling like I had lost all of my interests, goals, and even struggling to physically navigate any space (even my own home) in only a few months.

During college orientation, I was so uncoordinated, I struggled immensely to not bump into anyone or anything, understand where I was in space, what was going on around me, etc. I made myself stick it through until the end, but I ended up on a bench, unable to get up and get myself back to the train station to get back home. Thankfully, I was able to use my phone and get picked up by car. And that is how I would find myself feeling physically for the majority of the summer, simply unable to leave my house, or even my room. 

Due to a spiral of my problems, I have been in hospital, symptoms have returned, not to mention I need to constantly be verbal, which has been increasingly difficult during harder moments.

I have never struggled to this extent until recently, and I am wondering if it was the TMS treatment I was undergoing which caused this onset. I also thought it was possibly the serotonin syndrome due to a mistake with my medication (which has since been fixed). I am feeling very scared about returning to my life, because I’ll need to be doing things like working, which I have never been successful to keep doing due to my issues. I am so exhausted every day even when doing nothing, although I have been able to start drawing again a little.

Right now even typing and sitting in bed, I’m struggling to re-read what I’ve written, my vision is tunneled, and the damn AC is too loud, everything is too itchy, I’m dizzy, and have extreme brain fog. I don’t even know if this is the right place to ask for advice.

The truth is that I have never gotten an “official diagnosis“ for autism, although my providers work within the context that I have many struggles of autism- there has been no time for any evaluation because my safety (mental health related) has been the most urgent concern for the past 6 years, and my parents are from the Soviet Union, so they never caught on or got me checked out even though they knew things were off. (There were pretty clear signs)

So if I do seek accommodation or any help, the only related diagnosis that I have are OCD, anxiety/panic, and ADHD. Which doesn’t really explain the extent of my problem here.

Any advice on how I should handle the burnout? Do I get a mobility aid at this point? How do I keep myself upright and my speech comprehensive when I feel like everything is falling apart :,)";;;;
2025-10-16 05:30:01;Currently going through severe burnout after diagnosis and years of overachieving.;"Is severe burnout after diagnosis a common occurrence ? Before that, I can't say I was thriving but, at least I was able to have a minimal level of functioning. I was working at a stressful job but, I enjoyed it because it allowed some level of freedom. I had intensive contracts lasting 8-10 days and then, I had a pause for 8 days. Problem is that my diagnosis showed all the vulnerabilities I always had. I can't mask anything anymore and I'm afraid that my unmasked self is just this low self-esteem guy who has trouble communicating. This guy has always been there under the surface but, I was able to push myself enough to, at least, have a job and meet the demands of society. Now, I feel like I'm not half the man I used to be, just getting out of bed and trying to keep a stable routine is almost impossible.

On top of that, I developed maladaptive behaviour which fuel the shame. I get craving for food with high sugar content or potato chips. I spend hours watching videos online (porn addiction too) instead of reaching to people outside. I also have an history of residential and job instability. I was always able to pay my rents but, I moved so often in the last few years, it's not even funny. I also had this pattern in every jobs I ever had. First, I'm excited and I'm able to push myself enough to perform well. Then, I get tired and frustrated and I start looking for another job. I was able to stay at my current job for four years but, it pushed me to the point of exhaustion. I have unemployment insurance, so my financial situation isn't too bad but, I'm really struggling mentally. Not having a job severely limit my possibilities of interactions. I poured almost all of my life into my job, to the point I was using it as a way to escape the void from my real life. I feel so lonely and yet, I have so much shame inside of me, I'd rather stay isolated. I feel like I don't deserve any connection, my behavioural addiction serve as a proof that I'm not worthy of love. I also have this constant feeling of being tired but wired, I feel overstimulated AND understimulated at the same time. I'm always feeling this stress boiling inside of me even after 8 weeks of resting.

Existential crisis is adding fuel to the mix, I'm a 100% conscious that I'm a 42 years old guy who only ever had one short lasting romantic adventure. I feel this emptiness in my life and yet, I know all the coping mechanism that kept me isolated. I built myself a fortress to make sure all those neglected emotional needs wouldn't hurt me.

Saying that I feel lost is an understatement, living alone as a single middle age guy mean I'm the only one responsible for my well being (both financially and domestically). But still, I have a hard time getting the simplest task done. I feel like a complete failure, no way I'll ever be able to find romance,... No way I'll ever be able to do anything else than doing a job I don't enjoy, just to survive.";;;;
2025-10-16 03:58:59;"Is it only me or the discourse about ""fake autistics"" or ""fake adhd"" is just ableist and maybe sexist as well.";"Idk maybe i'm a bit terminally online but i have been seeing people do this whole discourse about people who are ""faking autism"" or ""faking adhd"". The pepetrators although mostly NT's. A lot of it are also other Autistic and ADHD ppl as well.

I see more comments of calling someone who is clearly autistic just getting bullied to death. ""Dont self diagnose"" they say or ""you're faking your autism"". Then recently a person who is non-binary but presents more fem if i remember correctly (so people in general might misgender this person as a woman), posts about their experience of not getting diagnosed with autism and the comments is just full of people accusing autism or say it to the person ""maybe you're just not autistic ?"" Or ""why would you want autism because i don't want it"". While ignoring the complexity and biases therapists or specialists has in general even in supposedly more developed countries or progressive areas towards women where they would get misdiagnosed with bpd etc.

Now lets put the focus back on the stigma of self diagnose, ""faking autism"" and ""faking adhd"". All i see from this whole discourse just brings more ableism and bullying. I really don't think it's THAT BIG of a problem if people who are faking it exists because i genuinely think it's not such a big number compared to the people who will realise what disability they have and can manage their life around it. 


This whole discourse imo is just negativity and what i see is just more autistic people and people who has adhd (self diagnose or not) gets bullied and insulted instead of bringing actual positivity. I've seen cases of self diagnosed people finally getting their official diagnosis and they were right. So i genuinely am so confused why some ND's talk about this as if this is such a massive problem that needs to be addressed. It's lowkey just gatekeeping for people who are more unfortunate economically (especially race minorities).

2025-10-16 03:08:22;Tips For the Autism Assessment;"

Hi, I have several questions as a 19 year old girl getting assessed for ASD; I didn't know where to go to ask them. I've already been diagnosed with ADHD and ARFID, and my ADOS is coming up. I like to be prepared and I haven't been able to find much about the ADOS online, but what does it entail generally?

Additionally, I was wondering if I noticed some red flags in my assessor, and how serious they are... he keeps saying things like 'everybody is a little autistic', and 'ASD/ADHD are superpowers!'

Also they wanted to wait to see if my ADHD meds had any effect on my ASD symptoms, is this standard practice? He also is convinced that I have anxiety from being undiagnosed ASD and ADHD for so long and I know I don't, I'm not an anxious person at all, but it almost seems like he is trying to push it onto me and won't take no for an answer. I know it's his job as a therapist to get to the bottom of things, but it almost feels like he's trying to make me think I have a problem that I don't?

Also, does anyone have any tips for how to deal with things post-diagnosis, how to come to terms with everything? I know that ASD/ADHD are often considered neutral conditions and are just a different way that your brain works but I can't shake the idea that something is inherently wrong with me and I can't fix it.

And lastly, (sorry for this very long post!) I was wondering how I should break this news to several family members/friends, considering that I come from a strongly cultural background where autism isn't known well or correctly. And advice on how to meet criticism and stigma, as well as people treating me differently?

Sorry about this post and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond!";;;;
2025-10-16 02:56:33;I'm using many of the resources available to me but its not enough;"First off, sorry for typos, i am typing on my phone and literally dont have the capacity to correct all my mistakes.

I am 29 years old (ftm) and while I've known i was autistic for nearly a decade, i was only able to get diagnosed this year. Though lack diagnosis wasnt barring me from resources, as im neurodivergent in other ways (ADHD and OCD) and mentally ill as well. Im in therapy, im fairly stable on my current medications.

 I have had my job for 2.5 years, full time hours. i like my job as much as i feel like im going to like the jobs i can get. At work im allowed an earbud, and nobody gets mad if i have both in as long as im aware of my surroundings and coworkers can get my attention when needed. my job is not customer facing and i usually do my own work with little to no help. My job is very process based and outlines what needs to be done and how fairly clearly. 

I have a incredibly loving fiance, we can afford food and rent alright, we have a very loving cat as well. I have a few friends but still manage to get out of the house and see my best friend fairly regularly. I have managed to build a nice l8fe for myself despite the many challenges i faced along the way. But right now my life is pretty put together compared to the first 11 years of adulthood.

So why am i struggling so much? Why do i feel like the burnout keeps coming back. I basically had a month off of work in May even (not saying why to protect my privacy) too, and it didnt feel like it helped. I take breaks when i can, i eat enough food, i try to do relaxing things, i go to bed early most nights, i bring comfort objects when im out,  i stim even in public (though its not the way i stim in private), i don't mask like i used to,i try not to be hard on myself. 

But the burnout comes back. I feel like im having more meltdowns/shutdowns, my frustration tolerance is so low I've had seriously bad meltdowns over something as small as the bluetooth on my phone not connecting to the car, i even got an aux cord to stop this from happening.  

I truly think im not really capable of working full time, even with 3 day weekends. I feel like working full time comes at the cost of a good diet, consistent excercise, a consistently clean apartment, maintaining any hobbies,  i can hardly watch a new TV show because it feels like too much.i cant build my PTO when i don't even get enough to really account for the extra breaks i need, and there's not really an option to take exvused, unpaid time off or work part time.

Im just feel like im using the resources i can access and it doesn't feel like enough.  I need more help. The though of going in to work tomorrow before the weekend starts makes me want to cry.  I cant even really envision myself making it through the rest of today even.

 I dont know how to ask for help because i don't know what help i need. I dont know if i even need help or I'm just exaggerating and being dramatic. I'm so tired of feeling like im treading water. I no longer feel like im drowning,  but i still feel like im in the deep end or a wave pool with nothing to hold onto. 

Idk what I'm even looking for with this post, comraderary?
Advice? Answers? Help? Honestly I'll take anything. ";;;;
2025-10-16 01:47:50;Invalidating doctor?;"Not sure what to flair this as, but it's not pleasant. 

My therapist can evaluate ADHD. She did on me and says I most likely have it. She told me to get a second opinion and get an autism eval along with it. I'm fine with this, and suspected for a long time that I'm one, the other, or both. 

I've been diagnosed with PTSD, BPD, and bipolar 2. I just want the full picture. 

I had to get a referral from my doctor and he basically said, ""what good will it do you to get an autism evaluation?"" I told him I want the full picture, coping mechanisms for both ADHD and autism work for me. I don't think that can mean I have either of those things. I've just heard a lot about misdiagnosis, especially with AFAB people.

I guess it just felt really invalidating? And insulting to people with autism. He's looking at it from a medication based perspective and is more focused on the ADHD. I'm just doing what my therapist and heart are saying. I don't see the harm in knowing. He said my therapist is making me do more work. I said I'm already doing a lot of work by just existing. 

He's just a basic dr. So I wasn't expecting anything from him. But it was so crappy of him to just go off like that. It just really rubbed me the wrong way and would like to hear your experiences, opinions, or any advice. I feel like he thinks I want a diagnosis. I just want to know? I don't see what the big deal in knowing is.

2025-10-15 23:45:36;Depression, again;"Hello, I translated this text from French for ease of use, but I speak and understand english.


H26, I was diagnosed with ASD and HPI. In 2021, severe depression and psychological follow-up for more than 6 months to understand that the differences I feel are not just in my head. I was put on antidepressants but I stopped after a month because it created a mental fog. 
After that, no more psychology because I thought I had returned to a level where I was capable of evolving on my own. I accepted that I had other needs, time alone by myself to rest or certain somewhat special habits, despite the fact that I love doing group activities. 

 
Today, following a complicated relationship, a depressed girlfriend whom I helped a lot while having a lot of activities on the side, I exhausted myself.  I explained to my doctor that I was very tired and that part of this fatigue had been present for many years... I was put directly on antidepressants (Escitalopram 20mg). The first few days were complicated, ups and downs, then this mental fog again. In the meantime, I left my girlfriend. 

 
Now I put a lot of things on hold to rest but despite this and 2 weeks of work at 50%, I still feel tired, no more passion, no more motivation. I work in IT/building automation... I am seeing a psychologist who is obviously very young and not at all specialized while waiting to have an appointment with a psychiatrist. I am considering possibly finding an ASD/HPI specialist but it may not be reimbursed by my insurance and I am already having financial difficulties with everything that I have not been able to treat in time during the year. 

I saw a post where someone was speaking about autistic burnout, maybe it's my case ? What's the next things to do ?

2025-10-15 21:36:02;Exploring neuropsychological approaches for adults with Down syndrome showing OCD-like behaviors, attentional decline, and trauma-linked anxiety;"I’m trying to better understand what kinds of neuropsychological testing and assessment strategies might help clarify complex behavioral changes in an adult with Down syndrome. Over the past two years, he’s developed intense, OCD-like cleanliness behaviors, increasing anxiety, and noticeable declines in attention and executive function.

All medical causes (GI, hearing, etc.) have been ruled out. He’s done therapy and currently works with a life coach, but progress is limited. His profile includes undiagnosed ADHD traits and a trauma history that fuels anxiety when he feels he’s done something wrong.

He’s extremely agreeable—often responding in ways meant to please others—yet when checking for understanding, he’s clearly lost. Conversations feel fragmented, as if he’s processing multiple “versions” of what’s being said simultaneously.

We’ve struggled to find a department within our health system to take ownership of this—neurology defers to behavioral health, and behavioral health defers to neurology. Wait times for neuropsych testing are a year out.

I’m not asking for clinical advice or diagnosis, but rather insight into:

What type of neuropsychological battery or framework might help illuminate the interaction between trauma, OCD, and executive decline in adults with developmental disabilities.

Whether behavioral neurology or neuropsychology is better suited to guide next steps in complex neurodevelopmental cases.

Examples of collaborative models (neuropsych + psychiatry + developmental medicine) that have been effective in similar presentations.

2025-10-15 17:58:45;Unique food issue: chewing;"Hello all!

I am an adult diagnosed with ASD. Like this group, I don't think my diagnosis means much. But if you're curious, I do have a diagnosis which I recently had to ""renew"" because I moved back to my home country after several years abroad and my insurance required me to get retested. I share this because I find it both amusing and also indicative of how broken the US medical system is. But anyhoo--my autism card was recently renewed. Rejoice!!!

**For the TLDR crowd, here is my question:**
I need help with food texture related to chewing, and the usual suggestions (eat soft food you don't need to chew, try blended foods [like soups and smoothies] are out for medical reasons), as are premade protein shakes and stuff also for medical reasons.) Given that, I canNOT brainstorm a solution on how to get food into me?? Halp!?!

**Now, background info for my actual issue:**
I have IBS and GERD (also diagnosed by a gastroenterologist.) I have spent the last 10 years working closely with gastroenterologists to deal with digestive system issues (an ulcer, adenoma polyps, ampullary, etc etc etc). I have also worked closely with doctors to figure out what food triggers my symptoms and have created a careful diet to avoid my IBS/GERD trigger. I have also ruled out other things like food allergies (had the needle test done), leaky gut, h. Pylori, etc. 

Despite all that, I am still having symptoms. So i am working with a dietician to try to really nail down what's happening with my stomach and why I keep getting sick.

We're sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel to figure out what's causing my issues. I have already ruled out or removed 99% of what could be making me ill. But my current dietician asked me a question no one had ever asked me before, which is: how carefully do you chew your food? And I said ""oh I Garfield that shit. One bite, the lasagna is in my mouth--pan and all."" She suggested I try carefully chewing my food and see if that helps some of my issues.

**Now to my actual question:**
Uh, turns out I can't?? Chew my food I mean?? It makes me nauseous. I am embarrassed to say it's taken me 40 years to realize that I inhale my food without chewing because the texture of chewed food makes me feel like I am going to puke. My breakfast is sitting half eaten near me, and I don't think I can finish it because I am so grossed out from chewing it.

**I used the search function before asking this question and here is why most of the suggestions won't work:**
Most of the suggestions for people who can't check are ""softer"" foods that don't need to be chewed, like mashed potatoes or noodles. But the issue for me is that I need to chew even that kind of food to make sure I am helping digest my food, as maybe I don't actually have GERD--maybe I actually have hypochlorhydria. So I have to chew ALL my food, regardless of how soft it is, to see if that helps. Then my dietician can recommend my gastroenterologist try a specific test for that.

Smoothies/blended food/things you eat with a straw are out because I need to try to reduce air in my stomach to see if that is causing some of my more minor issues.

Blended foods (like blended soups) are out because that's already a food texture that will make me sick. I CANNOT eat blended soups, never have been able to. 

And there maaaay be some sort of protein shake I can drink (I will have to research it) most of them are out because they contain fructans--which is already a food category I can't eat due to IBS.

**So to restate and summarize my question**
I am an autistic adult with IBS and GERD. This severely limits my diet already (no coffee, no spicy food, no fried food, no soda, no juice, no garlic or onion, etc etc). My dietician is beginning to suspect I don't have GERD, but maybe hypochlorhydria (though you can technically have both.) Due to this, she wants me to chew every bite of my food 20-30 times, and track how that is affecting my symptoms. Turns out I can't--it makes me wanna die cuz autism. Most of the suggestions on how to deal with this (eat food you don't need to chew) need to be ruled out either due to medical reasons or other autistic food texture reasons.

So....what the heck do I do?? Can anyone think of some idea I haven't thought of yet???

Help! I am a super active person, I bike more than 15 miles a day every day and I neeeed my calories. I also need to not be sick anymore.

2025-10-15 17:16:54;A testament to my thought war;"I'm 30 years old and I seem to fluctuate between having all the energy in the world, feeling like I can accomplish anything - to feeling squashed and out of energy like nothing is ever going to work.

Often because I just don't fit in some way.

I have been a square peg my entire life. Struggled with education, dropped out of multiple courses (electrical and mechanical) and have multiple failed or left behind business ideas in my wake. I have worked 20 different jobs since I was 16, the longest was 4 and a half years working on cars. I love cars, they are one of the only things that make sense, but sometimes they drive me insane when I can't fix something.

Another thing that makes sense sometimes is sharing stories and supporting others. I became a peer support worker in 2024 so that I could make an impact with my lived experiences. Unfortunately, I have just quit that job without another one to go to because the organizations set-up doesn't suit my work style, I found I was sitting there doing nothing for most of the hours at work (even though I had tried multiple times to resolve this/find work to do)... I think it may have been a silent firing. 

Idle time makes me crazy because I have had a reasonably stressful life, making me a good firefighter of problems.

I fell into heavy substance use which began with drinking large amounts of alcohol at 14. Then at 24 after a pretty bad break up, i fell into other substances (amphetamines) resulting in the loss of my first business and home.

That build/break lifestyle continued until I was 28. I eventually had enough of my own shit and decided to change, had already moved towns but the party life followed me. I was exhausted, physically, spiritually, mentally. Multiple visits to ED over this time, trouble with the law, you name it. 

Recovery has been difficult but worth it. In this time, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD, unfortunately this was missed at school and put down to behavioral issues.

I've had creative explosions and multiple awakenings, I'm healthier, better in every way, can educate myself and upskill. - but for some reason I miss being able to escape, i think its because sitting in my mind can be a difficult thing.

Anyway, this year, my mother passed away. I'm happy we had the near 2 year stint of my sobriety together, because I was able to help her with medical appointments, advocacy, and life things, like the business we ran together and managing her forgetful husband (which I'm still doing)

I used to value things like validation, material gain, you know, white picket fence - but now I'm just not interested. 

In fact, I have lost interest in just about everything. Other than Alan Watts and Carl Jung videos, and isolation.

Sometimes I make videos, on cars and about wellbeing. I became very passionate about this stuff because it is an escape from the day to day and the pipe dream is to be a creator of sorts. I have already written 2 books as well, which have been put on the back-burner while I figure this shit out.

A few weeks ago, I learned that my friend from home passed away by suicide. For some reason, it woke something up in me, like an unrest. She was 31 and had a young daughter. God rest her wonderful soul - it's a real shame.

I have been to multiple therapists. The best ones seem to operate with therapies like IFS and Transactional Analysis, as well as in the holistic and even spiritual realms. We often realise things, like the fact that I'm still on edge from earthquakes that happened in my home town when I was 16. (Christchurch New Zealand)

It's nice to honor these things and allow them to walk beside me, but I don't want to be a product of my past experiences. I am certainly not a victim of circumstances and I have had a lucky upbringing in relation to many. 

I'm at this point where I'm just sick of everything. People and their high pitched pleasantries, systems, work/life balance, parking the car, paying for shit - it's like I've broken through this invisible veil that has awoken me to something I can't fix, reality.

It's like I'll never fit anywhere, and I don't even know if I want to - but it's desperately lonely in this void. So I work more to achieve something, and face resistance at every turn. I don't give up but I pivot - and at the moment, no matter where I pivot, there is more resistance. 

It has taken me to the point of measuring how far away the ground is from the top floor of my local car parking building. That sounds really scary, and that's because it is, I have come so far to better myself and help others with their mental health, and I think I forgot that I still face the impacts of it too, I've just not had a thought like that in a very long time.

Everyone says: “one day you'll find the thing”, someday the path will surface, theres a reason for everything” yet I'm tired of waiting for the “thing” or path to surface.

I have tried tarot, mediumship, Journaling, 80 self help books, exercise, walking, mindfulness, meditation, writing, talk therapy and more to unlock the answers that never seem to surface.

Is it because I'm trying to solve an existential question that has no answer? I used to struggle with the idea of having a purpose on this planet – and now I feel like I know that I have one, a big one, but I don't know what it is - and it's driving me mad!

I tried the meds, they diddnt agree with me. I take lions mane and l-theanine instead - it seems to work well enough for me to be able to listen effectively and study.

I don't even know where I want this post to go, I don't want sympathy - perhaps it's just so that ot doesn't feel so isolating anymore. Sometimes when you share to the void the void answers back.

Perhaps I'll have another awakening, maybe I'll build another website, make another video, fix another car - and have some prophetic awakening that will shake me out of this desperate experienc. No idea. But until then, stay golden chosen one.

2025-10-15 16:32:45;Adhd and Asd;"Hi, I'm 23m diagnosed with Adhd. I wanted to listen to other people's opinion on the chances of me having asd based on how I interact with other ppl (Not trying to self-diagnose, but rather open to other ppl's opinions) 

1. I tend to be very fluid when talking in person, but get really awkward when chatting and maintaining contact online. I struggle to open myself and get really insecure on chat, whereas in person I'm able to talk for hours and be very charismatic, bc of others' facial expressions and voices giving me the security that the conversation is flowing correctly. 
2. I get bored at most people. Ever since I was a child, when someone not interesting to me tried to approach me, I would close myself entirely and rather stayed alone. Its like, if someone doesn't give me enough stimulation, Im not interested and prefer to stay alone. 
3. Although I need time to stay alone, I can't stand complete solitude. 
4. I tend to make use of lots of metaphors while speaking. Excessive sarcastic sense of humor, but only shows up when the relationship is close enough. 
5. Had a lot of insecurities in the past, I would act rather on pure emotion. 
6. When I had lots of social anxiety, I would avoid eye contact. Now that my social anxiety is gone (after years of hard inner work), I make eye contact without thinking. 
7. Most people bore me out easily 
8. I love to talk about my hyper fixations (I have a lot and they last for 1 or 2 months max), but consciously avoid it to not make ppl uncomfortable. 
9. Know how to read emotions in other ppl, but had created uncomfortable atmospheres b4 bc of my impulsive behavior. Now its better, but b4 it was hard for me to think b4 I acted or spoke. 
10. Tend to isolate if ppl bore me out. If someone bores me (80% of ppl do) it makes me uncomfortable to talk. But when I make a strong connection with someone, I can speak with this person for hours. ";;;;
2025-10-15 12:25:00;Breaking the people pleasing habit;"I am quite used to people pleasing, it's like an instinct. Sometimes I will mask so hard just to make sure I vibe with someone so that I don't offend them or upset them. I've become increasingly more aware of this since my diagnosis and even more so since I started seeing my new therapist. I didn't really think about it before my diagnosis, it was just like a second nature, would say it still is.

Since I've become more aware, instead of engaging with people just for the sake of making sure they aren't upset with me in any kind of way, if i remember to think about people pleasing, my only other option that i can think of is that I just ignore people or if they greet me, greet them back and then carry on. 

Please chime in if you can relate.

I was diagnosed in my mid thirties as having level one support needs as well as having adhd. I also deal with cptsd, and anxiety. The diagnosis has really helped shed some light on my deficits in socializing, which would probably sound odd to someone who knows me seeing as I usually appear happy and talkative. Those people don't know how much I mask, how exhausting it is, on top of that there's social anxiety and rejection sensitivity, which ties in to the people pleasing behavior.

2025-10-15 11:34:56;How do you feel after you’ve got home from work?;"I’ve only had my diagnosis for 8 months (am 55) and although I’m unable to work in a normal job I do volunteer at Citizens Advice a couple of times a week, when I’m able. I have started to notice that when I get home I feel completely exhausted and it feels like there’s something really wrong which I can’t put my finger on, both mentally and physically. 

I know recognising it is half the solution but it’s only the next day I see what’s happened. 

Am looking for some advice on how to deal with this as I don’t want it to ruin my volunteering as it’s the only time I go out and mix with people. ";;;;
2025-10-15 11:31:40;struggles with conceptual math;Hi! Im neurodivergent (diagnosed!) and I wanted to know if anyone else struggled with conceptual math. Like I’ve always been good at math, always procedural, where it tells me what to do point blank, I love it! But this year I’m doing conceptual math (algebra..) and it has been such a hard transition. It’s not at face value or telling you what to do anymore, and my brain pretty much ONLY takes things at face value, so I feel so lost. My teacher is fine, and everyone else seems to get it, but I feel dumb. I can’t even drop the class, and I can’t fail, so I just crash out everyday. I feel like everyone was born with two step equations up their ass or something! I just wanted to see if this was a shared experience and if there’s any recommendations. Thanks!;;;;
2025-10-15 11:18:30;24 years old - self suspecting - this is my story, but dunno if I’m struggling enough;"

In process of getting diagnosis, but unsure if it is worth it.

My parents (one is autistic) say I was  perfect. I remember being confused as my mom chased me around the house with a belt when I made mistakes. They say I got along with children my age. I remember feeling social pressure. My parents remember me as gifted and advanced, I remember that, plus an undertone of simmering anxiety that I couldn’t really pinpoint.

I could read at a first-grade level at five. By 3rd grade I was reading anywhere from 10-20 chapter books per week.

I fixated on things, but I admit that I wasn't obsessed with them o the point of being ""too much"" about it. It was mainly types of clouds, types of birds, and a computer game that I played for several years. I was resistant to certain clothes such as lace, turtlenecks, and flip flops. To this day, I cannot tolerate anything higher than a crewneck. I enjoyed being in small, quiet spaces and would spend hours under my desk (which I had covered with a sheet) instead of sitting elsewhere. I used to crouch and sit, and then spin on my mom’s Tummy Twister. I used to love putting those[ colorful, light-up spining spheres](https://sensorytoolhouse.com/products/light-up-magic-orb-wand?variant=47479643078849&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&srsltid=AfmBOopir0FA8SV5yezhKBZ_z7CNzdVQCqqU5c3zKDuzYqpjdKSqDWcuANY) (image linked) that vibrate under my chin, and let it vibrate my head. But I don't know if these behaviors were sensory seeking/avoidant enough. As I got older, I started stimming more with my body. I loved/love weighted blankets and rolling/rubbing spiky items in my palm. I rock constantly now, except when I am at work or around my parents, and I do shake my hands when I am upset and alone. I worry that I am faking it, but when I make myself stop, I feel like I'm going to burst.

At times, as a kid and early teen, I would get agitated, even to the point of shaking, screaming, crying, and scratching my own face because I was not able to be understood, and was struggling to express myself and my feelings. I would become overwhelmed and subsequently melt down. Now, I just rock and hit myself on the legs when I am alone. There have been times even in my adult life that I start to scream and cry when I am upset, and then I go be alone and start rocking and hitting my thighs. It's the only thing that helps get the bad feeling out of my body.

I was always better at expressing myself through writing, rather than words. I never felt understood when I spoke about my thoughts, feelings and emotions. I often found myself getting in trouble for being “rude” or “disrespectful” when my intentions were pure. I often mimicked accents and tone of others without meaning to. I would repeat the words I said back to myself in my head, like an internal/in-head version of [Brick from The Middle](https://youtu.be/Yw3m45sm0SM?si=Yeat1a203d61y_PU) (video linked).

After being homeschooled my whole life, I was  slammed with the reality that I did not fit in when I entered 4th and 5th grade. I made friends, and was also bullied by them. I was getting into spats with my peers for reasons that I didn’t even understand. I was anxious every morning, going to school with a stomachache every day. I made friends quickly, then lost them, and I was experiencing unprecedented social confusion. I was trying to be nice. Why didn’t they like me? I made one or two good friends - generally with boys, or girls who were “outcasts” like I was.

I was consistently having to go home early because I was always nauseous. My anxiety worsened as I became more aware of my inability to fit in, and the social demands of school. I hit my breaking point one day, in the middle of class, when I had a breakdown/meltdown/panic(?) in the middle of class after my teacher refused to let me go to the bathroom. I don’t really remember what happened after that, only that I ended up at home. I was homeschooled for the end of 5th grade after my parents realized that I couldn’t handle it.

In seventh grade, I made friends with a boy with Aspergers. We often ate lunch alone-together. Our time together increased after I found out that my “group of girls” thought I was too loud, too annoying, too much, and all made fun of me behind my back.

High school was four years of desperately trying to make friends, and succeeding sometimes, but not being anyone’s first (or second, or third, or fourth) choice. I was depressed, suicidaI. I joined clubs, but could barely participate due to exhaustion. I ended up as one of four in a friend group during my senior year, but even so, those people didn’t really know me.

College - I failed my freshman year and was so suicidaI. I was burnt out and I have on friend from those five years, despite getting along with people on a surface level.

I have a full time job. My boss likes me - I am precise in both speech and work ethic. However, I don't gossip with my coworkers nor do I desire to do ""team building"" stuff. I come home and I don't have the energy to cook and clean, i often just lay there on my couch until it's time for bed. I'm depressed and pushing away my friends, as I don't feel loved by them, and I long to feel loved.

# But I did fine, I live alone and I'm alive, and I make money and maybe I'm just lazy. I don't want to be a seeker who just takes resources from those who actually need it. Maybe I was just a normal kid and I'm over pathologizing everything.";;;;
2025-10-15 10:41:55;i'm lonely, how do i make friends?;"i'm 21f, late diagnosed, and have no friends. 

i used to be active on twitter and made a few friends on there — even ended up meeting my boyfriend on twitter... but i deleted it. 

some of the male ""friends"" i made on the app didn't actually have friendly intentions and flirted with me. i didn't really pick up on this either until my boyfriend saw the messages and explained how flirty they were being. he wasn't upset at me, but felt bad because he knew i genuinely wanted friendships. 

as for other women i didn't really have much who reached out to me and it felt hard to keep convo's going. (does anyone else have that problem?) it almost just feels like a fake-ish nice compliment battle back and forth 😭... anytime i took it further than compliments and wanted to really chat it didn't feel very reciprocated.

i ended up deleting the app, not just for that reason but it was better for my relationship and overall mental health. 

plus the app was going downhill anyways...

online friends were ok but i really was and still am craving an in person friendship. 

 i have my boyfriend to talk to but we're long distance. he's busy a lot with school and other things. sometimes he's busy hanging out with his own friends and it reminds me how lonely i am. 

i want friends to hangout with too. especially with halloween coming up it brings these feelings... its one of my favorite holidays and i feel like i'll never get to be like the other girls my age going out together and having fun or watching halloween movies together. 

i've put myself out there, talking to people at concerts, going to events by myself, but nothing comes out of it... 

one time i was talking to this girl at a kpop club event for a kpop concert the next day. we were both solo. we were both dancing next to eachother and made a convo (i was pretty awkward though), i asked for her insta and we even added eachother! she said she would be right back, she was just going to the bathroom... i embarassingly waited 30 minutes. then i looked to the side and saw her dancing with a group of people instead. i decided to leave after that. 

i haven't had a friend since high school and its just all really lonely.  

sorry for the long tangent. ";;;;

It was then that I started to realize that I was truly different from those around me. Looking back, most of my friends over the years were the folks that people avoided due to being “weird” or “quiet” or “different” - autistic, deaf, visually impaired, etc.

2025-10-15 10:02:45;ASD misdiagnosed as ADHD? (Not AuDHD);"I have been diagnosed twice in life as ADD/ADHD - once as a child in the 80s and one as an adult in 2008 (before the DSM-5 ASD criteria).

After receiving my ASD 1 diagnosis in early September, I have had a lot of time to reflect and it suddenly occurred to me for several reasons that I may actually just be ASD and not AuDHD as I initially assumed. 

My first reason is based in medications - no ADHD medication has ever properly worked for me. They have always had side effects that outweighed any perceived benefits. 

I’m curious if anyone has been through a similar “a-ha” moment where you start to believe the ADHD diagnosis should have been ASD without ADHD co-occurring?";;;;

I started going to therapy and mentioned that to my therapist and she said that it could be linked. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with autism, but people have made questionable comments to me before and I’ve been diagnosed with other things. 

I know there’s a percent chance they’re linked and I’m wondering if anyone has experienced it before themselves or knows of other people who have. ";;;;

She regressed at 2.5 yrs we thought it was a speech delay during covid when everyone was wearing masks. Her daycare said she's not keeping up with development milestones and they couldn't take care of her if she wasn't potty trained by 3. My wife quit work to be at home full time. After getting a formal diagnosis we were able to add ABA and OT to ST. She's come such a long way. She is speaking more every month. Learning so many skills. The reason I'm here is to learn to be the father she needs at every stage of her life. I have become more patient. I want to ask autistic women what they wish their dad's knew. I am happy to speak with anyone. I want to align my thoughts, expectations and my own behavior to be supportive. Feel free to dm. I greatly appreciate it. Thank you. ;;;;
2025-10-15 07:21:54;just learned that most people don't script every social interaction in their head beforehand;"Wait.

You're telling me.

That most people just... talk?

**Without**:

\- Rehearsing what they're going to say 15 times

\- Preparing multiple conversation branches depending on their response

\- Having backup topics ready if silence happens

\- Analyzing their facial expressions to determine the ""correct"" response

\- Memorizing phrases that seem to work in similar situations

\- Practicing their tone/inflection/body language

\- Running a post-conversation analysis of everything they said wrong

They just... say words?

Spontaneously?

Without a script?

I've been doing this my entire life and thought everyone did.

Turns out: No. This is masking.

**Other things I just learned are masking:**

\- Forcing eye contact (I thought everyone found it uncomfortable but did it anyway)

\- Mirroring people's energy (I thought everyone was exhausting themselves trying to match others)

\- Laughing when others laugh (even if I don't understand why it's funny)

\- Suppressing stimming (I thought everyone had to consciously control their body)

\- Pretending to understand social cues (I thought everyone was just better at guessing)

\- Creating a ""work persona"" vs ""home persona"" (apparently most people are just... themselves?)

**I got diagnosed 6 months ago.**

Since then, I've been realizing that my ENTIRE personality might be a carefully constructed performance.

And I don't know who I actually am underneath it.

**When I try to unmask, I feel:**

\- Terrified (what if people reject the real me?)

\- Lost (who even IS the real me?)

\- Guilty (am I being ""difficult"" or ""unprofessional""?)

\- Exhausted (because masking is automatic now, unmasking takes effort)

I'm 35 years old and I'm basically meeting myself for the first time.

Anyone else going through this?

How do you figure out who you are when you've been performing your whole life?

Tried to go to my doctor, and it was a psych one, she said I wasn't and she wouldn't test me because I could make eye contact and was able to talk with people. Ummm...ok yes I can but it is draining and mostly because it was beat into me as a child you make eye contact and it is rude not to. I have no idea what to do now or who to turn to. She is giving me the max dose of anti depression meds to deal with everything including the ADHD and it just feels wrong. I need help. I have started to do research and ticked off so many things on lists that it made my head spin, but what can I do to prove to a doctor I need help and is a diagnosis even that important?

2025-10-15 03:21:42;Can someone overcome sensory issues?;"First, I’m not diagnosed yet, so I’m not sure if I have either autism or sensory issue, I wanna ask if my situation really counts as sensory issue so I’d know if I should mention it to the doctor or not.

I’ve checked dsm5 and read/watched about lot people talking about the symptoms in detail and most things matches, it’s just the sensory issue I’m not 100% sure about. 

When I was a kid, I don’t have much sensory related problems, other than I hate wind (cuz it’s too loud) and I hate tight clothes and clothes of certain textures. But the clothes don’t effect me much other than it making me physically uncomfortable and bit annoyed, I never had tantrums (or wtv) from it. I even really liked with going to malls and amusement parks, even if it is loud there. (As long as my mums there, because I really don’t like talking to other people and I’d get extremely anxious if I can’t see her) 

As now, there’s still lot clothes texture I don’t like, still hate the tight clothes, and I really hate the feeling of makeup on my face. 

But I really enjoy dressing myself up, often overdressed for occasions (like I would rock up to the supermarket with my mum in a full alt outfit with full makeup). I would still wear makeup and the texture of clothes I hate, first because they look really damn good, second because I already spent money on them it’s a waste of money if I don’t wear it. 

It would get very uncomfy for me at the end, and it sometimes makes me extremely annoyed when going out and made me nearly cry, or I’d just shutdown and be semi responsive to people I’m with. But I’d still do it next time I go out. 

Also now that I’m in college and I’m allowed to wear makeup, I’m wearing it everyday to prevent myself from falling asleep in lesson (because of how uncomfy it is it’s physically impossible for me to sleep in it) 

I don’t know if those counts as sensory issues at all, would be very appreciated if anyone could answer it. 

And thank you for reading this (I’m sorry I really don’t know how to write this shorter so you’d have to read a whole page 😭)

Edit - I completely forgot to mention the food texture one, I never can do food texture I don’t like, I’d gag straight away if I eat something that’s the wrong texture and sometimes it make me feel sick for hours. ";;;;
2025-10-15 03:15:10;Why do Aspergers guys struggle with romantic connection??? Just trying to make sense of it.;"If you're an Aspie guy you know what I'm talking about. I see guys sharing the experience on a regular basis here. Just search ""dating as guy"" in this sub and you'll find literally 100s of posts.  
  
 I think many of us(guys and girls) relate to the ""my whole life made sense when I got my diagnosis"" feeling. It was similar for me explaining why I never had any luck with the ladies. 26 year old and haven't even held hands with a girl romantically. And I'm fairly good looking, when new acquaintances ask me and I say I've never been in a relationship they're surprised. So I got no excuses there. I always had a date to marry mindset so if I didn't see things working out with the girl I was interested in because of career goals, location, cultural differences I drew the line and didn't pursue them. And a few that I was interested in looks and intellectually, well they weren't interested in me and always got dry responses so I didn't bother much since low effort is a huge turn off for me. 



I never simped (as they say) or anything (maybe that's the reason for my singlehood lol). When someone needed help, guy or girl I helped as per my capacity without expecting anything in return (got discarded once I served no use to them a lot of the times too). One possibility could be we aspie guys dont come off as masculine enough ?? But I dont think I lack that ""backbone"", if anything I have too  much pride and very low tolerance for disrespect and cant stand going against my morals. Another possibility is that we seem boring. And there's the infamous weirdo vibes. Or simply a combination of all of the above. 



In the end I've given up on finding a partner, even if there'll be a hole in my heart and it'll just keep getting harder as I get older. And just to be clear I am not blaming women or anyone for my singlehood, you can't force attraction or tell someone what they should like. 



I'm just trying to make sense of it all. Has anyone figured out what and why causes us to be undesirable and unsuccessful with women?



Input from women is also appreciated.";;;;
2025-10-15 01:38:27;Help me understand what I'm feeling?;"I don't know that I'm ASD level 1 or not. To keep it short. I took all the autism awareness tests and they basically awarded me a certificate the end saying I had a f*** ton of autistic traits. One of the tests even went as far as saying as I have 100% chance of having autistic traits. My son is diagnosed ASD level 1. Now that the pre-context is out of the way, I'm trying to figure out what I'm feeling here. 

I love working with machines and rebuilding engines as a hobby. I almost enjoy rebuilding the engine and the end product more than I do driving the car sometimes. Everyone who sees my garage is astounded at the order and how much stuff I get into every nook and cranny. All like things are stored together in specific categories. It gets messy sometimes during large mechanical projects, but that is inevitable and I understand the disarray and I will clean it to near sterility before beginning work again at intermittent intervals. 

My friend has undiagnosed inattentive ADHD. It is incredibly easy to identify because of his behaviors. I talked him into buying a Jeep a while ago and telling him that the inline 6 was incredibly easy to rebuild. That was over 2 years ago. I did all the machine work and had the engine put back together and ready to go and I delivered back to him with a head and block separate because he still had to clean some parts. That's where it stayed. I went over to his house today to help him work on this car a little bit because he said he was having trouble getting started due to decision paralysis. When I arrived there was so much clutter, so many redundant things all over in different piles. I felt this immense anxiety wash over me. My day had already started out abberant because I took something from work that I should not have taken and had to return it. So I did not start my day out Typically. I also didn't plan on spending time with him and helping him with this. It was somewhat of a impulsive decision because I was closer to his house than I was to my own. I could only handle about 2 hours at his house before I felt the need to get the f*** out.  When I left I realized I was unaware of how tense my body was. I was pacing in circles in my kitchen for 10 minutes before I realized what I was doing. I was unable to decide on what to do with my remaining time before I had to get my children off the bus. I felt very anxious. Very very very very very anxious. When I was in his garage. I recognized this. I chose to take additional Adderall because it helps me tolerate situations like this much better and allows me to function normally. It did help a little bit. 

My question is why do I feel like this. What is happening in my body and brain that is causing me to feel so distressed in a cluttered environment like that. I also noticed my frustration and distress because I could not get him to focus on a singular goal. I'm just trying to understand what the trigger was so I can better cope with it before I feel as elevated as I do. Thank you for your time.

2025-10-14 23:33:16;If you were diagnosed with autism as an adult, what signs made you want to be diagnosed?;"Hey guys first time post.

Growing up I had a parent say they think I have Asperger’s (I believe this phrase is now frowned upon so I do apologize if it is, this was 10+ years ago although I know they have said they think that I have autism in the last few years still). They would say this because I’m antisocial, I don’t like itchy tags, I enjoy having a routines things work out in a timely manner, not many friends. and I’m sure they had some other reasons somewhere in there. 

This person is not a medical professional or anything. With journaling i just remembered about this and it got me thinking, what signs did others see that made them want to get diagnosed? Did it change your life? I just want to see if it’s worth talking with a psychologist and find out what they say but would love others inputs. Thank you. ";;;;

2025-10-14 18:37:50;I unexpectedly learned that I'm neurodiverse, any tips or advice to help me educate myself on the topic?;A few months ago I started to see a therapist to deal with personal issues, and ended up learning that I have ADHD and that I'm probably autistic as well. I did not go to therapy to get that info, my therapist just happened to point it out during our sessions, asking me if I ever got diagnosed etc. Apparently it is quite common for women to learn that kinda late (I'm 25). I didn't get to the point where I got an official diagnosis (mainly because more sessions would be too expensive for me), but I did get a lot of useful information and resources. But at the same time, it feels like it's too much to process all at once. Anyone felt like that when they started to learn about their neurodiversity? I'm not sure what kind of tips or advice I'm looking for, but if you have some that comes to mind I'd really appreciate. Thanks :);;;;
2025-10-14 15:59:29;How to circumvent sensory issues showering/bathing?;"Pretty embarrassed to be posting this but here goes nothing

Okay so autism isn’t my only issue, but sensory issues definitely don’t help. I also have issues with fine motor skills from dyspraxia and temperature regulation + chronic leg/hip pain due to ehlersdanloss. (Also potentially have ADHD but that’s not diagnosed). Showers have been completely out of the question my whole life, tried a few times, HATED it. It feels like being hailed on

Before I was just about managing. I washed myself every other day, didn’t enjoy it and it took ages but I got it done. But since starting collage hygiene has been a much bigger issue.. I don’t have enough time to try put on a brave face on the mornings and when I get back home I’m so exhausted the idea makes me want to cry

I’m only managing to bathe about every two weeks at the moment and I feel gross because of it, I already struggle with low mood too so feeling down about not being clean kind of traps me in a loop. I DO sponge clean myself to the best of my ability with the sink some mornings but it doesn’t feel like enough - I’ve been recommended body wipes but google says those aren’t acceptable to replace bathing/showering with either.

I don’t know if this is even the right place to be asking this because I kind of have a cocktail of problems, if not I’ll try post this to a more broad disability subreddit but here was my first choice because I feel like there’s a better bet of people understanding how my brain works";;;;

2025-10-14 14:28:03;I talk like baby when I unmask and I don’t know why;"*I haven’t been professionally diagnosed*

I (19F) used to talk with this “baby voice” ALL the time when I was younger but constantly got yelled at to stop it so by 8 or 9 it was mostly gone and I’d only talk like that when talking to myself. I’d say it was entirely phased out by 10. I think this is when I started masking (9 or 10) and ever since then I’ve rarely ever used the voice. 

Now I’m 19 and trying to unmask more at home since masking my autism (and suppressing my vocal/motor tics) is becoming way too much for me. This “baby voice” has kind of morphed into baby talk with a babyish tone and has returned but only if I get too excited, when I’m experiencing negative emotions (overstimulated / having a meltdown), or trying to unmask.

It makes me super self conscious and I wonder if it could be related to the unmasking/autism or if it’s something else? Has anyone else experienced this or something similar?

2025-10-14 12:36:16;How can I possibly be accepted?;"I’ve been pondering on this subject for weeks now. Almost obsessing over it. That’s why I’m here. I’m not diagnosed with autism (can’t afford to be tested either) however I wholeheartedly believe I am. I can’t tell you if I’m “high” or “low” functioning. I can say that I need help in certain areas of my life. Such as socialization and what not.

Anyway, I’ve been wondering what acceptance feels like. And how does one obtain it while being unmasked? I tend to bounce between being a pessimist and a realist. My inner-monologue has developed into an utter a-hole, with nothing nice to say about anyone or thing. It’s constantly telling me what I should be doing and how I’m a failure for not doing certain things. My therapist believes I developed this as a sort of self defense mechanism. While “outside” me, is such a kind, caring, and thoughtful person. Almost as if we’re complete opposites. 

I’ll often try to solve my life problems, at least give them an answer. So when I begin thinking about how lonely I am, my inner-monologue (or “inside” me) just tells me it’s because I’m a loser and a failure and things like “How the f*** could anyone ever love you let alone accept you?”

There’s only a few things I truly hate. But I’m at the top of the list. I know I should be at peace with myself. But I hate myself. I hate how I look, how I act, how I think, and how I feel. I hate being so different. So much so that I started putting myself through acts of self harm. It started with cutting. After high school I began abusing controlled substances. And after a decade of isolation, I didn’t get any better. Only things to change were some deaths of those close to me. That and I began using more substances. Whatever I could do to numb how I feel. 

Now at the age of 30, disabled, disheartened, and discouraged, I try and find a purpose in life. I feel like I’m an embarrassment to everyone I know. And I feel ashamed. I only have one friend and he lives on the other side of the country. That and he’s not the nicest person, nor is he really accepting. I find that I can confide in nothing. I find comfort in nothing, as there is none to be had. I have nobody that I can spill my heart out to. I could say more but I’ll stop here. 

Apologies for rambling and ranting. I thought I’d give it one last try to reach out for help, didn’t know where else to go😔";;;;

2025-10-14 08:41:36;Comorbid communication difficulties for autistic adults that are diagnosable and treatable?;"I'm (31M) someone who has been active a fair bit on Reddit for the past 3.5 years. I recently graduated with a PhD in my field two months ago and I've sadly been struggling with autistic burnout and various mental health disorders ever since I've been active here on Reddit. One aspect that's come to my attention from others I've interacted with on this site as well as those I interact with in person is that my communication style is apparently awful.

I'll state right off the bat that I think this is a thing for two reasons:

1.) When I write, it's usually not for an audience at all, even for posts on this site. I know I mentioned I have a PhD at the start and that wasn't meant to be a flex at all since I've been told that not having this skill as a PhD is highly unusual among other skills I never developed over the course of graduate school (Master's and PhD).

2.) I've been told multiple times throughout graduate school that I'm good at having a super narrow focus. That's also been a critique against me when I've been told that I ""can't see the forest from the trees"" at all. This narrow focus never improved throughout graduate school for me and I would always rely on my advisors to copyedit on my milestone projects (Master's thesis, qualifier project, and dissertation) for me so I could better address their critiques.

The above reasons are all in addition to the usual ""issues"" (I put in quotes b/c the double empathy problem is a thing) most autistic adults experience with being direct and everything like that too. In case it helps, I'm also ADHD-I, have motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed in addition to my Asperger's diagnosis I had at 9 years old.

So, are these communication difficulties diagnosable and subsequently treatable at all? Most importantly, would I need to mask if I attempt to treat this issue at all? I attribute my autistic burnout largely due to my high masking throughout my life, unusual program experiences (which I won't detail here for now), and that I wasn't on prescribed stimulants for the first time in my life until two months ago and those (Wellbuitrin XL and Ritalin) have been a massive game changer for me.";;;;
2025-10-14 07:40:03;How do you deal with sensory issues that can't be avoided?;"Hey I'm not diagnosed with a neurodiversity, but have been struggling lately with with what I think are sensory issues. My new one is the feeling of the baby hairs on my forehead hairline, sort of a tickling. Even when I slick my hair back with cream I can still feel it, so it may even be a phantom feeling, but it makes me want to rip my skin off.
All the advice I've heard for sensory issues is how to accommodate them, like wear sunglasses. 
But what do you do if there's nothing physical that eases the intense agitation? Itching the area helps but it returns as soon as I stop.
I often feel it at night or when trying to rest, and it makes me intensely anxious. ";;;;
2025-10-14 07:37:25;"Newly licensed Registered Nurse drowning in orientation; seeking advice from neurodivergent nurses.";"Hello!

I am a newly licensed Registered Nurse (inpatient float pool) orienting on a med / surg unit. I was diagnosed six months ago with Level 1 ASD. I also have diagnoses of ADHD and OCD. I am reaching out for advice from Registered Nurses who are also Neurodivergent.

How have you all handled being a neurodivergent nurse? What are your tips and tricks for getting back on track during interruptions, multitasking in an overstimulating environment, having to ask for more clarification, staying on time for scheduled med passes, etc.?

Background On My Situation:
I am having a very difficult time in orientation. I have been told that I am a very thorough and safe nurse, but I am extremely slow. I am working as fast as I feel I possibly can, literally breaking a sweat, but I am easily spending 45 minutes to 1 hour with each patient during med pass. I know that I have a poor concept of time, but I had no idea it was this poor. This is causing me to spend the rest of my day drowning and feeling like I am incompetent. After lunch passes, I feel like I am just going through the motions and am unable to process learning anything new. It’s like I am in survival mode. I know that this comes with being a new nurse, but I also feel like my neurodivergent traits are making things even harder on me.

Since I am a new nurse, I am sure there are so many more obstacles I have yet to face. If there are any that you have come to notice have been difficult for yourself, please share what they are and how you’ve managed to work through them. Since my diagnosis, I have been learning as much as I can about ASD so that I can ensure I have the tools I need to help me through the day. With it all being so new to me, there is a high chance that I haven’t learned everything about my personal traits yet. Some of these could be making things more difficult for me at work without me realizing it yet, so literally any and all advice is welcome. Thank you SO MUCH for taking the time to read this and thank you in advance for the tips, tricks, and advice! <3

tl;dr: I am a newly licensed Registered Nurse (inpatient float pool), diagnosed with Level 1 ASD, ADHD, and OCD, drowning in orientation on a med / surg unit. Pretty please send any and all advice you have as a neurodivergent nurse. Thank you so much!";;;;
2025-10-14 06:12:34;How do you describe Asperger’s?;"I got recently diagnosed with Asperger’s and to me it makes sense. But if someone were to ask me how Asperger’s made me “different” I wouldn’t know how to answer honestly speaking. All I could say 1+1=11 for me and not 2. 
Sometimes I hate myself for it and sometimes I think I’m a genius. I hate the fact that sometimes I feel like a genius because I don’t think I’m entitled to it due to the numerous things I don’t know. Although I hate myself for it for most of the time. I feel like everyone is light years ahead of me. Everyone can grasp the simple concepts and it should be simple but I just can’t. I know I’m capable but I just can’t. 
I haven’t spoken about it openly with someone who also has it. So my question is, how does it make you different? How would you describe it and explain it? And how did you get past that self hatred and crushed self esteem?";;;;
2025-10-14 05:13:09;unique motivations in pursuing formal diagnosis...what do you think?;"So I met with a new psych dr today and she stated what I have been suspecting all along... that my BP diagnosis from 12 years ago was inaccurate and that level 1 autism and ADHD best explain what I am experiencing. But she also noted that since she can't formally diagnose that she suggested I proceed with testing.  She mentioned it would bring clarity, help create access to optimal supports, and potentially protect legally and help provide accommodations and a better explanation of my needs to the long list of specialists I see.  I had not even considered these aspects previously.  I hadn't pursued testing because I no longer can work, so I didn't see a point in needing modifications, and I don't qualify for SSI due to income threshold.  I had not considered all the potential unique scenarios where this formal diagnosis could be my advocate, such as when I am in the hospital from time to time and get treated poorly by nurses for needing sunglasses in the room and the beeps turned off and get called ""childish"" and ""anxious."" Or needing accommodations while travelling or at theme parks to avoid crowds and heat.  Or needing assistance with overwhelming tasks like paperwork or excuse from jury duty if that ever were to happen. The list goes on...I would love to hear unique situations where a diagnosis either helped you or you wish you had one, or just other thoughts about what I am discussing. Thanks!";;;;

But anyways, literally yesterday I was out shopping for several hours at the mall with my boyfriend. Suddenly a switch flipped in me and I was done and didn't want to be there anymore, I felt overwhelmed, I grew extremely quiet and unresponsive to my boyfriend talking to me.

2025-10-14 00:19:26;Negative on AQ and EQ test and disappointed?;"Hey guys! I'm a 31 year old woman with a backstory and questions, lol.

  
Today my therapist told me that both my AQ (Autism Spectrum Quotient) and EQ (Empathy Quotient) tests came back ""negative"". I've been telling her about my suspicion that I could be autistic, and now I'm kinda ... disappointed. She said that I show autistic traits on both tests, but didn't score ""enough points"" to get a diagnosis.

I've been struggling with certain things throughout my entire, conscious life, and I put a lot of hope into getting a diagnosis, hoping that would explain certain things. My therapist simply told me that I might be highly sensitive.

As a child I've been quiet and had ""my head in the clouds"", didn't have a lot of friends and spent a lot of time playing alone. All my teachers said that I had very good grades even though I was ""too quiet"" and not ""involved in class"". I had instances that I recently discovered were ""Alice in Wonderland-Syndrome"" episodes, were I felt like everything was moving in slow-motion, or I felt like my arms were longer and ""away from me"". Moments where I felt like my blanket was as thick as cement and my body as thin as paper.

I've been always told that my voice sounds monotone, flat or cold, even if I'm being friendly. I have very strict ways and set routines that I follow, and if a step gets interrupted I become irrationally angry. I'm very sensitive to noises, and can hear electric devices being charged or turned on. I have an urge to explain myself or explain things to the point where people told me that I should stop correcting or lecturing them, even though I was simply trying to inform them, thinking they would find it as helpful as I do. People seem to think that everything I do has some hidden meaning, while I am being as clear and transparent as I possibly can be.

Last year I slipped a disc in my lower back and was in excruciating pain, and found myself impossible to go out and be around people, as everything got way too loud, uncomfortable and smelly. Things that never bothered me before made my head pound, got me dizzy, and got me angry and overstimulated. I started fidgeting really, really badly, and started ""slapping"" myself on the thighs and sides to self-regulate. I had regular, nervous breakdowns were I cried uncontrollably, cradling my body back and forth to calm myself down. All things I've never discovered about myself, and that pushed me to seek out a diagnosis.

A part of me accepts this ""failed diagnosis"", but another one thinks it's unfair. A lot of the questions were way too vague for me, and I had to add a lot of details about each question as to why I rated it the way I did.

On one hand I fear that, should I indeed have autism, I've learned to mask it so badly, that it has interfered my test results. I can for example read people's faces, can read between the lines, maintain eye contact and am not obsessed with numbers or dates. 

On the other hand I also fear that I've been ""hoping"" for this diagnosis so badly that I ... just started to act autistic??

I know this is a lot of text, and there are a lot of nuances to autism and getting a diagnosis, I just feel ... incredibly lost, and don't know what to do with that feeling. So, if anyone out there has a similar story, or maybe can relate a little bit, I'd be very grateful to read that and know I'm not alone - and not lost.

Thanks a ton for your attention! <3";;;;

I've recently realized that most of my struggles are related to my ADHD. I started seeing a doctor and educating myself more about it. Through this journey, I've learned that I also have many autistic characteristics that often contradict my ADHD. My doctor agrees but told me that it's not worth the money to go through getting diagnosed with autism since there are no real treatments for it (I don't have insurance so paying out of pocket gets expensive). I'm excited to learn ways to make life easier for me but I also feel like I need help with medication. This is where my question comes in... I have been on Adderal for a few months now. He worked me up to the max does of 20mg twice a day (not ER). It very well could be my brain as I'm very indecisive and I'm totally over-analyzing this but I feel like it's not really doing anything. Sometimes I think it might be doing a little something to help me concentrate and not be such a mess but it's definately not life changing! Should I try something else or give it time?

I feel like I should also note that recently I started taking fish oil, magnesium L-threonate, L-Tyrosine, Ashwagandha and B12. I've been doing that for about a month.

I have been going through a journey of self acceptance and love and compassion for myself ever since, which includes trying to be patient and not immediately invalidate my own diagnosis just because I don’t fit some standards, or if I come across somebody who is also autistic and experiences some aspects of their life completely different than I do. 

One of the things that is making me think lately is the topic of special interests. While I know that not every autistic person necessarily has them, I’m trying to understand if certain things I’m passionate about can be deemed as such. The doubt comes from the fact that so far, my understanding of special interests is that they are topics that an autistic individual will busy themselves with, not necessarily to the point of being considered an obsession. 
I however can’t say that I spend much time delving into the topics that I’m passionate about (music, languages, Tolkien, to name a couple), and the only explanation that I have come to, is that my ADHD makes it really hard to do so. 

Without going too much into details: I tend to get almost obsessed about things, the most common are crafty hobbies like crochet, needle felting, sewing/quilting, embroidery, but I’ve also had a LARP phase, an indoor plants phase, a foraging phase, etc., but they’re all very short-lived, and I’ll likely get obsessed over something new every week or every other week. It’s exhausting. 

So my conclusion is that I’m too ADHD to pursue my special interests. Anyone else?

2025-10-13 20:13:29;I'm diagnosed ADHD. My mom is not sure and wants me to get rediagnosis;"I'm 19. Almost 20. Male

I got diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago (I was 18) by Neuropsychologist. It wasn't cheap, but that time it was worth it. I had to argue a lot and convince my mom for 2 years before that to get me to diagnosis (since I was 16) She had a hard time accepting it. But eventually I won and got me to diagnosis.

My country doesn't allow meds specifically for ADHD like Adderall, so recently I started looking for an alternative way, I found a site where I can order Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for delivery from other country.

But again, my mom thinks it will harm me and is so emotional about it that she sometimes belives I still don't have ADHD and it can be a factor of other things. She copes very hard. 

She tells me that if I want to get medication I have to get diagnosis AGAIN from reliable doctor (she talks specifically about famous psychologisy from our country) to specify that I CAN take medication. And while it's possible, I don't want her to spend money for literaly same answer.

At the same time, I'm not getting the help I need because of her irrational thinking. So maybe I should get diagnosis? 

What should I do yall

2025-10-13 17:49:22;Late Diagnosis: How long until acceptance?;"I (M 48) was diagnosed in early September with Autism. Roughly six weeks in I still don’t fully understand or comprehend it even though I self-referred for screening. I think I thought I would ultimately be “screened out”.

When the process got underway I began to see where it was possible but even after the confirmation appointment, I still wasn’t sold. 

I think my subconscious is waiting for a moment where I finally “feel” Autistic. Since I only suspected Autism as a passing possibility for so long, it feels inauthentic to own it.

It’s been pointed out to me by my therapist that this may be some internal ableism based on stereotypes of Autism, combined with decades of highly practiced masking that have left me without my own true sense of self. 

My question for others who have been through a late diagnosis process, when and how did you reach an acceptance or alignment in your “new” Autistic identity?";;;;

hey everyone. it’s been a while, and i’ve got an update. i saw a new specialist (my gp actually managed to get me one within two months, which was a miracle). i went over all my symptoms, explained the previous diagnosis process, and we decided to do a reevaluation. i also talked with my mom and, apparently, i was hyperactive af as kid. like, way more than other kids my age, even though now i’m mostly inattentive.

so yeah… turns out it actually is adhd. i started taking vyvanse and wow. neurotypicals just live like this?? i’m calm, focused, productive. i don’t need extra motivation just to do stuff. it even helped my anxiety and a bunch of other things i thought were separate issues.

basically, if you’re in a similar situation, keep pushing for answers. do what you can and don’t give up on yourself. i feel like i spent the last 10 years playing life on hard mode, but not anymore. also, qb test sucks ass. ";;;;
2025-10-13 14:59:17;relentless trauma flashbacks and intrusive memories;"Hi everyone.

I am a 32 year old male who recently came to terms with the fact that I MIGHT be autistic Level 1.

I never got an official diagnosis but at this point in my life the official stamp ""you are autistic"" by a clinician or a government is not important.

In fact, when I used to abuse stimulants the person who partied with me was the first person who suggested I might be autistic because I always had EXTREME reactions (involuntary facial tics) then after that it's been a long journey putting together puzzles from my life that felt needlessly difficult to come to the discovery that I might be autistic level 1 after all.

Since a year ago after experiencing major life setbacks (getting fired) and drug abuse and withdrawal, I feel like my brain semi-permanently lost resilience has been stuck in 'nervous system overdrive, chronic fight or flight, trauma flashbacks and intrusive memories mode. To elaborate symptoms, I am constantly triggered by neutral everyday cues, like the way light penetrates the window, or the weather, or someone's tone of voice, facial expression, or could be internal stream of thoughts, that remind me of my worst experiences that have to do with shame, humiliation, rejection, exclusion. Then my overactive amygdala immediately plays those memories in full vivid detail and I can't tell if I'm being yanked back to the past moment or not.

I tried Lexapro and that worked until it turned to debilitating insomnia that wouldn't turn off, (plus complete zombification). I know benzo works but that's temporary and it's a beginning of slow death.

Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms from me and if they have healed, was it a mix of medication and 'time heals everything'? I feel hopeless and stuck.";;;;
2025-10-13 14:56:46;Alcohol and masking autism;"15 months ago I got sober and then got diagnosed with autism, after I very quickly realised that I cannot socialise the same way without it.

2025-10-13 14:36:00;Trying to process abusive childhood;"TW: abuse, violence, ableism

I was diagnosed when I was 4-5. My parents never accepted it and were convinced I was a broken, defective, fucked up kid. My dad wanted to “fix” the autism with violent regular beatings, verbal abuse and degradation, threats to send me to foster care and to the psych ward. He dragged me by the hair on the floor, choked me, destroyed my belongings in rage. My dad thought that all of that would “fix” the autism and make me “normal”.

This went on until I fled home at 19 terrified for my life. I was prepared to sleep on the streets and die there - that was preferable to going back to my dad. I then saw a bunch of therapists and they told me I had abusive parents who severely traumatized me and that I was probably not autistic.

I cut contact with my parents a year later. Upon informing him that I was cutting contact, he stalked me, trespassed on my property at midnight multiple times, called the cops on me two times saying I was suicidal (I was not), left super threatening voicemails on my phone about my dad insisted that I was “mentally ill” for wanting to cut my parents out of my life, that he did “nothing wrong” (lol) and that once I “calmed down” from my “autistic episode” we could talk “properly”. he also said that he would go find my therapist at the time and show her “documentation” about how I was “mentally fucked up and broken autist” and that my parents were only trying to do the best they could for me to “fix” me. he also said that I was not allowed to cut him off because I was his daughter and that I couldn’t do that.

I had to move to stop this harassment and stalking and block my parents everywhere.

I have been in therapy for dépression, complex PTSD for several years now. I am working on the insecurity and deep shame that my dad instilled in me that I was fundamentally broken. I ought to believe I am enough already to love, that other people in my life now love me as I am.

I am trying to undo all the damage from my dad who told me my whole life about how unloveable I was, how much of a horrible person I was, that no one would ever want to be friends with me or date me, how I was ugly and fat and repulsive, how I was at the bottom of the hierarchy of human beings and how I was so worthless that if I got r*ped I 100% deserved it & it would be my fault & that if it weren’t for him, I’d be a homeless crackhead who would not even graduate elementary school.

I am writing here because it is very difficult and I was hoping to find people who went through similar experiences who might understand. Thanks for reading.";;;;
2025-10-13 14:02:54;DAE feel like they’re respected MORE when they’re openly ND?;"Back when I didn’t tell people I was neurodivergent, I feel like I got a lot of hate. People definitely saw me as a “weirdo” and “annoying”. Even when I tried to “mask”, people would still not like me, and when I thought my “masking” was successful, I would find out that they knew I was different the whole time and just didn’t care. 

Now that I’m open about having autism and adhd, I feel like people are so much more respectful towards me and less judgey. I wonder if part of this is because of society’s (unfortunate) tendency to hate on neurodivergent traits, but once someone has a diagnosis that becomes a big no-no.";;;;

It feels invalidating when she talks like this to me, I feel like it shouldn't be too much of an ask for her to just believe, but idk if im just getting dramatic over nothing or what, any thoughts on this situation or suggestions on how I should deal with this would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

However, I was just watching this one video where I noticed that I forgot to ""turn it on"" and so it looked like I wasn't feeling anything when I deeply was.

I wrote a little essay on my personal substack about it:

2025-10-13 08:17:41;suspected AuDHD, need advice;"22yo female, suspected - AuDHD, cptsd and/or/ptsd, ocd tendencies, rsd, etc.

i found the perfect place in my town for an assessment - they’re named as an ADHD place but they test for autism, depression, anxiety, ptsd, ocd etc. too, and i’ve been researching, testing myself, listening to podcasts for years now, and have been so sure. i even briefly got to see a psychologist but only because i got 2 free sessions and couldn’t afford more, but got a report saying i should be tested for it and she thinks i could have Level 1 autism and inattentive ADHD.

i just doubt so much if i really could have asd, adhd or AuDHD and it makes me wonder. because it cost a lot of money here. ($2300 where im looking currently which is the cheapest that ive found testing for not just one thing), and they ar looking into getting a discount for me since ive explained my situation and because they’ve said they think i should get assessed.

i’ve been diagnosed with BPD, generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder a few years ago when i was in a very toxic and abusive relationship, smoked a lot of weed and went through, what i believe was cannabis induced psychosis, so i was not in a good space and don’t even remember seeing someone and never got told my diagnoses or informed on them. anyway ive been wanting to get reassessed properly for so long now that im single for the first time since i was 13, out of the blur state, sober, back to my normal self, and have been speculating this for so long.

ive felt different my whole life, but my memory from a lot of trauma and dissociation and the weed smoking from a young age, makes it hard to remember what i was like all my life and just a lot of things. but i just keep doubting if it’s the right thing to do or if it’s all in my head. and im just scared i could get misdiagnosed again or not be able to explain things right or have a bad day on the assessment day and just all of these things. and my family don’t care about all of this, tell me “everyone struggles just get on with your life” and don’t think it’s a big deal so it makes it harder to deal with on my own, even though i’ve dealt with all my emotional trauma and issues on my own, it just would be nice if someone in my family cared yano.

anyway i could explain a lot more but this is already longer than i wanted this to be. i’m just lost i guess and i really want to know what to do and other people’s advice. i can explain more/answer any questions in the comments if i get any lol";;;;

2025-10-13 06:30:33;Hyperconsciousness Question;"I was officially diagnosed with autism not long ago, and while it explained everything I’ve felt my whole life, it also made me realize just how exhausting it is to constantly be aware.

It’s like my brain and body are tuned to every frequency at once between sounds, textures, people’s emotions, even my own internal state. I see the patterns in everything, but I also feel every one of them, and it’s hard to live in a world that isn’t built for that kind of intensity. 
Lately I’ve been struggling to keep up with daily life. Cooking, errands, small changes in plans, they all drain me faster than I can recharge. My awareness has grown, but so has my awareness of how fragile my regulation really is. It’s like I can analyze the mechanics of my burnout while I’m in it, but that doesn’t make it stop.

Does anyone else relate to this?
Feeling too aware, too conscious, too sensitive as if the more self-aware you get, the less functional you become in a practical sense? How do you balance deep awareness with actually living day-to-day life without burning out?";;;;
2025-10-13 04:40:48;What do unemployed autistic people do all day?;"Hi everyone this is my first time ever posting on Reddit. 

As the title suggests I'm wondering about what other autistic people do? I found out that I'm autistic and probably have ADHD around 2 years ago but I am only still slowly coming to this acceptance and fully identifying as autistic. Especially considering I don't have a official diagnosis, I'm only self-identified. 

I'm currently reading this book 'Unmasking Autism' by Devon Price and it's been extremely validating. I've never felt more autistic in my life and I actually feel like other people share similar struggles as me. It makes me feel a bit more like I belong to this world. Anyways, it's made me feel like reaching out to some of you to figure out what other's experience of life is like. 

Reading this book has been extremely validating in terms of not feeling like I'm alone with these struggles, but I still feel very alienated within my current context. I'm currently unemployed and have moved to a new city (4 months ago). I also don't speak the native language here, making finding a job increasingly more difficult. I've been on welfare and looking for a job, or at least something that I could support myself financially. I don't really feel like I have have the energy to be able work, but I also cannot live being so poor any longer. I have SO many interests but can't commit or feel like I could do any of them long term (like a career 🤮). 

I live with two roommates who I'm sure are both also neurodivergent but are more unaware of their limitations and therefore don't know how to respect them. So adapting to living with other people has been a real struggle. Especially in a busy city. I feel overstimulated nearly 24/7 other than late at night, so I've been on a shit sleep schedule. I am always on flight or fight and am never able to rest since I've gotten here. 

Basically, I feel really lost and am unsure of where I should invest my dwindling energy day to day. My ADHD gives me endless ideas of what kind of life I want or what I might want to do. The problem is I never have the energy, resources, or motivation to follow through on any of my ambitiouns. 

All of this leads me back to my initial question, what do you guys do in your unemployment? Clearly pressuring myself to find a job, or some way to make money isn't working. I haven't felt safe enough to enjoy anything I normally 'enjoy' and I'm severely depressed, and can't afford anything extra I want to explore. Maybe I need to accept being unemployed for awhile, even though I'm not sure how long before I'll be on the street... I'm very broke. 

This was very long winded. If you took the time to read all of this. Thank you. It would be cool to hear from anyone about what they do to stay sane while being unemployed without feeling useless or ashamed of their life. Also how you do you afford more than just food and rent?

If you need clarification on anything for more context please ask me :)

Thanks guys";;;;
2025-10-13 04:01:27;How to improve physical fitness with no motivation;"Hello. I want to get better physical fitness and overall improve my health but I can’t find anything that I stick to. 

I have a battled depression for 5 years now and have also been diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I currently don’t do much due to me reducing my dosis for antidepressants medication. This means I don’t leave the house at all anymore. 

I want to create a better daily routine where I get out of the house and move my body. Where I can socialize more with people and just be more active and happy with daily life But I can’t find anything I will stick to. I have tried countless sports clubs, tried simple walking, going to the gym but I always do it just once and never again. I just don’t have the motivation to do something good for myself. I like pets and currently have two lovebirds. The feeding routine and care is probably the only reason I get up in the morning. They sadly don’t encourage me to get out and move though. I’ve wondered if a dog would help me but my family don’t want a dog and I feel scared to even ask if it’s a possibility. 

What other things could help me get outside and move?? Spent hours talking with chat gpt and it basically just gave up on me. Hope someone have some advice

2025-10-13 02:51:29;When did you find out you're autistic? How this changed your life and how you learnt to cope with difficulties? (Longer life story included because I terribly need advice);"I'm 23. I learnt I might've been autistic two years ago. I did ADOS-2 and consulted a therapist but for the official (valid) diagnosis, I need to wait until November 28th—that's when I can meet a psychiatrist. 

Finding out was life-changing. It explains my patterns of thinking, special interests, shutdowns and meltdowns, sensory issues, tendency to take what others say in a regular conversation literally instead of being an arrogant smartass like my mother thinks...

It's just that I've never had any support. I only had an opinion as a kid that I was intelligent but needed more time to process things than others. I didn't know why I couldn't get along with most other people or why my family thought I was quirky (nowadays narration is no longer weird but ""spoiled, wasting time, lazy, self-absorbed.""  
  
I generally have a toxic household I cannot leave yet because my parents pretty much sabotaged my college and finding a new job (I fall into a burnout after burnout since my mother lost the rests of her sanity two years ago and started working off on me—she'd always treat me like her therapist but now that I'm done with it, I suddenly am ungrateful, or she does those monologues so everyone heard, tells me I don't know what stress is or that I find illnesses for myself to justify how much I ""don't"" care about my future etc.)

My healthy stims like pacing or rocking were once repressed. I recently tried to come back to them to reduce harmful stims (of course more acceptable because it doesn't look that weird when you pick the skin from your lips as when you rock back and forth ""like an orphan""). Two years ago my mother also disliked I drew so she threatened to throw away my supplies I bought for my own money. That's when I started failing, because drawing has always been my way for regulating emotions I often didn't fully understand. 

I don't know what to during a burnout or shutdown. I'm physically blocked from trying to save my thesis, eating, coming back to drawing to maybe feel better, or doing this one thing I wanted to do for my career. I fell into a shutdown today. Haven't done anything for a couple of hours. Haven't said much. I felt blocked to even drink. I'm so tired of that dysfunction because I literally perhaps won't be able to defend my thesis anymore and can't yet move out. I don't feel like I could work even now. I guess I need advice from other adults on how to manage life better or I'll seriously just give everybody a reason to ask me if I'm proud of my failures.";;;;
2025-10-13 00:25:43;How did you get diagnosed as an autistic woman?  I’ve been dissociated for 20 years;"I have a question for everyone on the spectrum, especially women. How did you get diagnosed?

I’m 28, and I’ve been in a dissociative state for about 20 years. I know it sounds strange, but it’s true.  since elementary school, I never really knew what I was supposed to do, and the older I got, the worse it became.

In middle school, high school, and university, it was complete chaos. I’m someone who masks extremely well . all my energy, strength, and intelligence go into masking. Also  I was constantly dissociated, I’ve always been irrational, with zero sense of rationality.

I’ve seen psychologists and psychiatrists before, and they all told me I just had mild depression or something like that. To be fair, I never really said much ,I didn’t know how to express what I was feeling, and honestly, I didn’t even understand my own emotions.

By the age 27  I made a very heavy, irreversible decision I went through a surgery I didn’t need, without even understanding what it was. That’s when I completely broke down, and that’s when I finally got a diagnosis. Because when you break down, the mask falls.

My mother spoke to the psychiatrist about my childhood, and that’s when everything made sense. Without that tragedy, I probably would never have been diagnosed.

But even now, I can’t forgive myself for what I did to my body.

So I wanted to ask how did you get diagnosed? And more importantly, how do you understand yourself now? Because I still don’t understand myself at all.

2025-10-13 00:25:08;Understanding I'm (probably) AuDHD made everything even harder;"It answered one question for me. One. Why I felt like an alien for my entire life. And I coped. And it was so hard. And I cried sooo much behind the scenes. I'm not saying things were all sunshine and butterflies because they weren't.

For the last year, roughly, a lot of people around me ""came out"" as neurodivergent (excuse me if I'm not using the correct term (?), English is not my native language, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings), and of course we talked about that a lot. I also met a few new openly ADHD people who talk about their experiences in therapy and adapting a lot. I have two close friends who are in the beginning and middle of their autism diagnosis. 

And the more they learn and we talk about things, the more I'm like ""hey, that is me, too"" and ""hey, THAT is me, too"" and it's a neverending story. And of course I started to look into this and figured I probably am a little of both, also because I feel torn between these two worlds a lot, too.

I am not diagnosed. I don't know if I ever will be.

However: life got so much harder. I realize so many things now that I brushed away. They take up so much space in my soul. And I also feel that no one really talks about that? Everyone is treating their diagnosis as some sort of ... I don't know, turning point to a better life? 

I feel even more lost than before. I feel like I belong even less. I realize when I'm masking, now. It gets even harder doing this consciously. I realize people realize I'm different a lot more. I catch more stares. I catch unease. And at the same time it takes so much more energy to adapt.

I hope I'm not intruding a safe space here by saying all this despite not being diagnosed. Today is just really rough and I hope someone might relate to my experience and tell me this gets better.";;;;
2025-10-12 22:23:18;You also struggle with verbal instructions?;"Hey!, so, I'm a bit nervous bc English is not my first language and as a recent language student majoring in English (as a spanish native speaker) I have learned a thing or two about me and being asperger that I didn't noticed until now. 

I was diagnosed with asperger when I was 14, but I  have always thought something along the lines ""meh, I don't even struggle that much with the typical difficulties associated with being within the autistic umbrella!, I know that if put 100% of my effort at understanding something then I can totally nail it!"" and recently, three weeks ago I started college and hah, well, obviously I have to face the fact that this affects my life in more ways that I have thought. 

I want to clarify that I never was the best student in the class either, my grades were always among ""14, 16, and at my worst moments bc of bullying and anxiety's 10, 12"", the max note is 20 btw. So, yeah, these last three weeks I have fought with being ridiculed in class by a teacher for asking ""stupid questions that if she never mentioned then it doesn't matter, don't even think about it!!"" (I was just asking what type of APA citations she wanted for the assignment), I also recently did a mind map for an English virtual class and the grade that could be a 100% end up being 80% simply because I didn't understood the instructions clearly (my mind map was good about the information but lack in organization) which lead me to feel a bit defeated bc i even asked to my father's for validation that the work was looking right, and a days ago I did an English test, it was supposed to be individual but the teacher changed it for two students, the questions where extremely personal like ""what is your name, who are your father's"", and I was sooo confused bc how are we supposed to answer that in a group of two?!?!, there isn't much space for long answers!, she said ""just answer as one student"" but I really didn't understand at that moment so we did the following format: ""my name is___, my name is ____"" and right now I am just realizing that maybe we did it wrong, I am a bit nervous bc is the same teacher that got mad at me for asking for APA citations and she likes to treat her students as fools, I don't want to hear her mad again. I don't know what is my problem but even if I understand 80% of the instructions I still manage to do it wrong, or even worse, that makes me a bit sad and worried about my academic future. 

Well, sorry for all the information, but it is a personal experience that I wanted to share and if you have one please consider comment!, it also helps me practice my written English, I hope I made myself clear with all this blabbing, hehe, I was thinking to do a ""corrected version"" with grammar apps before posting it but I think that I need to allow myself to make mistakes and learn from them.

2025-10-12 21:58:26;Guys, are any of you happy?;"Hi, fellow nd folks

My question is kind of general. Are any of you actually happy and how did you get there? 

Here is the context.
I'm 34, and i was diagnosed with ADHD  less then a year ago. It might be AuDHD, but my psychiatrist isn't sure. I'm on my third depression/burnout episode. I take antidepressants, as for adhd meds, they are banned in my country. 

Last January I gave up ESL teaching and became a night auditor at a hotel, it's worked really well for my brain and I might even be close to a promotion. 

But other than that my life is a mess. I tutor on the side to support myself financially, and I'm better off then when I was a teacher, but I just make ends meet. My house is a mess. The kind of mess you see in the beginning of ""depression house cleaning"" videos. Energy? I don't remember the last time i had any. And since hobbies need energy too, they just collect dust in the corner. And of course my lovelife is non-existent. 

How do i untangle this? I know I'm smart enough, I speak several languages and I have university education. But I have no clue as to how get myself to do better.

2025-10-12 17:58:08;Identity crisis: who am I, how to behave, what to look like, what to enjoy?;"Does anyone else not know who they are? What they truly like? What they should look like? What they want?

(29M, in the process of a formal diagnosis for Autism and possibly inattentive ADHD) 

I am approaching **30** and I am going through my most intense identity crisis ever. I've always been like this but it has been exacerbated during this last year because life circumstances have been going badly.

I've always tried to figure myself out through **TV series/movie characters** and **other people** around me. However, it's not even remotely easy to pick up the traits I like and find interesting right now. I'm just lost.

I feel like I'm simply floating around, existing. Not even going with the flow. Just being around doing the basics. Which is a shame because this is not living, this is wasting my limited-duration existence.

As I said, this year has been - and still is - very rough for me because many difficult things are happening in my life. There's a high chance I am going through a burnout. Things will not get better soon, because there are family health issues going on so I have to hold on. 

Any people experiencing/having experienced the same? And any advice on it? Thank you in advance.";;;;
2025-10-12 12:55:54;Is there enough of a difference between a trauma therapist vs a autism therapist?;"I(34) was diagnosed earlier this year (level 2 asd) and am currently seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma, I was wondering if seeing one who's speciality is in autism would be worth it. I am still mostly trial and erroring my way through understanding myself. I have noticed that I am having more and more frequent meltdowns/shutdowns but it's difficult to tell until either mid or post meltdown/shutdown.

Would switching therapists be worth it?";;;;
2025-10-12 12:43:57;My confusing experience with the diagnosis labels process and history of bad therapists.;"**Intro:**

I'm 30.

Added the NSFW tag because I talked about fetishes despite it being vague but still lol.

I've read someone's story of their confusing story of their diagnosis process and labels and even though I wrote to them back I feel like other people need to hear my story too but I'll keep it very short as possible (probably not).

I started off getting diagnosed with autism (not Asperger's due to cognitive issues aka learning intellectual issues also developmental delay and not being able to function as a normal adult), ADHD, anxiety, and depression, now I know autism is a spectrum but I never really related to that as I don't have issues reading facial expressions or body language and I'm not really sensitive to sounds or how socks feel or any other type of clothing other than tags or something and not really sensitive to other senses, maybe doesn't like certain toppings, but that's it. I'm actually attracted to some senses which are fetishes for my sexuality like smells, sounds, sights, feelings, and tastes, but I'm not going to get into that here and they're not even pleasant senses either that's the weird or gross thing like not even neurotypicals are into these attractions or at least not most of them and neurodivergents aren't either but I met some neurotypicals and some neurodivergents into my fetishes/kinks. It's possible my neurodivergence gave me these sexual fetishes to cope with the bad senses but I'm not sure because some bad scenes I always kinda liked like certain smells, lol, so I think it depends in my case. Autism is a spectrum but I never felt logical enough to be autistic and I was diagnosed with a low IQ at a late age despite having academic issues all of my life, I feel like the school was fixated on autism too much, maybe they confused it for intellectual disability back in the day or something, I was born in 1995 so autism was starting to get more attention in the media kind of, but not as much as it does now. No job ever interested me, I was never smart or even interested in computers, technology, it just never interested me and the math of it all confuses me. I'm more right brain creative not left brain logical math kind of a person.

I never was even medicated for ADHD so I doubt I have it, I've had that label since forever. I always had schizophrenia or schizotypal traits in childhood but it never seemed to fit full criteria for those disorders, in fact, most of my mental disorders are like that, it's just so weird, I never heard voices up until early 20's but it was whispers embedded within real sound and couldn't make out what the voices were saying which is funny because Dr. Grande said if someone reports saying they hear voices and can't make out what the voices are saying then that's a sign of malingering but I think that's just not always true. It went away after taking antipsychotics, this was in 2015, I started having delusions I was in either the Truman Show or the Matrix or some weird combo of both a video game TV show or something like that one gameplay in Saints Row IV where you have to play as if you're in a 1950's show or whatever. The medication made the weird beliefs/delusions go away but I ALWAYS kinda had weird beliefs, devil worship/theistic Satanism, spiritualism aka belief in ghosts, aliens/extraterrestrials, autistic people seemed less likely to be into these beliefs, that's probably why I got diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar disorder in 2015, but that doesn't really fit me either, here's why: My moods aren't ""random"", my depression spawned out of bullying and other terrible life events. I will admit my hyperactivity/mania seems ""random"" but even with that sometimes it has a trigger. Also my mania lasts hours, a day, rarely days or a week or more and never hospitalized for mania or anything and not super out of control of spending or out of control in general.

**The schizotypal/borderline obsession arc:**

For many years, I've been obsessed with the idea of me having schizotypal personality disorder and or borderline personality disorder, I discovered these diagnoses before 2015 hoping I would get diagnosed, I said to myself:  
YES! This fits me BETTER than autism and schizophrenia! I am WEIRD and DIFFERENT and feel like an alien but NOT for autism reasons! I have weird beliefs! I (used to) speak OVERLY metaphorical, even BEFORE discovering schizotypal (so I'm not faking), my speech is (and still is to this day) circumstantial and tangential, more so than a ADHD person, but, for some WEIRD RIDICULOUS reason, no mental health doctor EVER decided to consider this diagnosis to me, or at least, never told me. I've mentioned to it MULTIPLE times to therapists/psychologists/whatever, and ALL I got was derailments from them, it's not hypochondria because they never said ""No"", but they never said ""Yes"" either... at one point it added to my delusions that my state I live in is a fake Truman Show because you gonna tell me every other area knows about schizotypal but my state? I was getting VERY paranoid that this is a conspiracy that NO ONE in my area knows about schizotypal, and indeed, maybe people over here ARE uneducated despite studying this stuff for years? One therapist told me ""Labels don't matter"", that phrase, crushed me, made no sense, destroyed my lack of identity even more which leads me to the borderline part, identity issues. I've had anger and identity issues since forever, am I bipolar? Bisexual? Democrat? Etc. I just, NEVER felt like I fitted into ANY label, not religion, politics, mental disorders, anything, and I eventually felt like therapy for me was just becoming a waste of time and money.

**We need to talk about bad therapists:**  
There is a video I watched that talked about bad therapists and a lot of people I think focus way too much on why therapy doesn't work for other reasons like financial problems or lack of resources which are valid concerns but there is not much talk about how we have the resources but the resources can sometimes contain bad eggs. A lot of the experiences I had with therapists has been atypically bad. I went to this local mental health facility in 2015 and that's where I got the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis, but they seemed to pass me around from doctor to doctor there to the point to where I could see one doctor there and then a new one next appointment like it didn't make any sense. I had one doctor there not believe me that I had trauma because I ""never talk about it"" but that was in the one month of me seeing him like you expect me to open up that early about it? I was medically gaslight for YEARS with both mental and even physical health doctors but mostly mental, medical gaslighting seems to happen more to women when I researched it online but I'm a man and I got mistreated. I was put on invega, for schizoaffective, a disorder I might not even have because I didn't start hearing detailed voices of coherent words until 29 years of age doing edibles and the reason why it's not schizophrenia is they are never negative they are voices outside my head saying ""Jonny"" and ""Hey"", the only negative voices are internal hallucinations I get but they are not my voice and it's not intrusive thoughts you just have to know there is a thing about external hallucinations and internal hallucinations and I have both and I read somewhere internal is more negative which makes sense, see, this is why we need better labels in the DSM, I've read that book for about TEN years now and been questioning my mental health diagnoses labels for YEARS even back in the Facebook days I remember a photo said ""It's good to get a diagnosis because it puts a little name on the thing you're struggling with"" or whatever, I became ANGRY at the mental health and psychiatry field for giving me medication that didn't work, gave me side effects like low libido and stayed up for days, etc.

**My antipsychiatry arc:**  
I started to find OTHER explanations for my behavior, demons, spirits, simulation theory, I was even sent back TO that mental health facility in 2017 due to bad behavior aka cops at my house like is that even legal? Why couldn't I choose which therapy I wanted to go? Why do I even need to be legally forced into therapy? Why that facility? Why couldn't the cops just tell me to ""knock it off"" and walk their merry way? I started joining groups going against labels. I didn't like the neurodivergent label because it was painting problems as ""differences"" and while I do feel different I OBVIOUSLY have defects. I have trauma but doctors don't think it's PTSD despite being bullied, attacked physically at a young age, ok, whatever, keep on downplaying my problems, again, I had a therapist in 2023 tell me ""Labels don't matter"" and I NEVER got a diagnosis from that guy, he also would criticize gender pronouns too and which he said that my generation is just too obsessed with labels, I'm not even lying here. Another doctor which was a psychologist gave me an IQ test, because I requested it, my IQ is 74, can you believe that? Because I can't either, don't get me wrong, I do think I have some intellectual problems like I can't live on my own or drive or whatever and not good with math or technology/IT/STEM stuff like I HATE that stereotype sooo much that autistic people or femboys or furries are good with IT/STEM stuff because not all of us are. This psychologist dismissed me too, said ""Oh yeah, I heard of schizotypal, it's a personality disorder, well that's not why you're here I'm here to talk to you about why you have autism and a low IQ"", he said this when I questioned him in the very beginning of my first therapy session with him about me possibly having schizotypal. He also told me to ""get over my anger"" and that I need to ""get a job"", which WASN'T WHY I was in therapy, he seemed smug, rude, apparently in my paperwork he wrote ""antisocial problems"" like ""anger"" and ""argues with people"" ""lack of remorse"" but hold your horses people, before you discredit my story by labeling me a ""sociopath"", I was never even DIAGNOSED with antisocial personality disorder, just that he wrote I had ""antisocial traits"" in my paperwork along with avoidant personality disorder traits and my IQ results, I DON'T relate to the traits of ASPD that is lying, deceit, etc, my story here is 100% REAL and I wish to GOD that all of this information I'm sending you here is just fake, something to make because I'm bored or for some other reason, I wish, but this whole thing sent me into depressive episodes that made me TURN to cannabis/marijuana in the first place which ALSO destroyed my mental health even MORE because I started getting more hallucinations, delusions, and WORSENING HEADACHES EVERY DAY which physical doctors are still trying to find out despite brain scans being normal. However, now, I'm neither propsychiatry or antipsychiatry now, more neuropsychiatry. I don't love it or hate it. I just want to be left alone now, which is, my healing processing WITHOUT therapists, medication, etc, self therapy, self help basically. I've had many friends use this ""ANTISOCIAL"" label against me which has caused me to cut contact with these toxic friends and people in my life, this is why I hate labels for myself! I had to go to the psych ward (well technically it was the emergency psych room) after dealing with these 2 bad therapists and not even the doctors at the hospital could tell me my diagnosis other than ""Depression"" and ""Anxiety"" despite showing CLEAR symptoms of odd speech and weird beliefs of some kind of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, however they did note I had pressured speech and I was delusional because I said I didn't believe in ""mainstream reality"" even though I think that's ridiculous as not everyone believes in mainstream reality, some of us are pagans or believe in simulation theory or are spiritualists. I was just sent in a conversational loop with those people like Groundhog Day and was even mocked by one doctor there! I overheard him!

**The healing process with self therapy, less time on the internet, and my possible mental disorders that I'm struggling with:**  
So just to end this because it's long, I'm done, I might be done with therapy forever or at least trying to figure out what is my mental disorder is. It may sound like hypochondria or OCD to a lot of people, and I've thought about that, but here's why it's not, or at least, not totally:  
There is a type of OCD where people are afraid of having schizophrenia, for me, it's not a fear, just a ponder that I might have schizospectrumsomething, and I legit have the symptoms, not a fear of having them, like I literally have paranoia of being gangstalked (however it's true I do legit have a group of trolls trolling me for years I've been on those lolcow sites before so it gets confusing trying to differentiate between my legit haters/trolls and the imagined ones), I used to believe in shadow people when I used to see them in the corner of my eyes. I found my diagnoses MAYBE:

Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder and Cycloid Psychosis, I discovered MCDD a long time ago and it seems to explain why I have a little bit of everything and why therapists can't really put me in a box, autistic traits, schizotypal traits, schizophrenic traits, bipolar-ish traits, ADHD traits, ALL in childhood too! And Cycloid Psychosis I just discovered recently thanks to some YouTuber. Cycloid Psychosis is multiple psychotic episodes but you make a full recovery each time which explains why I don't need antipsychotics, because I know people scream at me online telling me to ""GET HELP!"" and ""GO BACK ON MEDS!"" but I don't think I need them, maybe ADHD meds, but that's it. I'm done. I'm done with labels, the only ones I like are Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder and Cycloid Psychosis but they are not even recognized in America. DSM needs to include them. I make and listen to music to heal from my problems. I'm going to end this now. I need to step away from social media, maybe that anti label dude was right, that therapist, maybe he was right ""You're looking into things too much!"" aka ""You're looking up too many things on the internet!"" or whatever. I REFUSE to believe this is health anxiety, I seen how health anxiety people act, the level of self awareness they have to ADMIT they have it and the self deprecating humor that comes from it, I must have somatic delusions or something, I ALWAYS believe that I am ill with SOMETHING. BIG HOWEVER, I do have Homocystinuria, a disorder similar to Marfan syndrome, so maybe my mental disorders stem from that, as Homocystinuria can cause mental issues, vitamin B12 deficiency is related to it, which can cause psychosis in severe cases, developmental delay due to Homocystinuria, low IQ, etc. I'm done with social media, I deleted my vlogging YouTube channel dealing with these topics and other social media accounts like Twitter/X, I was so done with the drama I had to deal with on there.

**TLDR:**  
I've been obsessed with trying to figure out what my mental illnesses/neurodivergences are since forever, is it schizotypal? Borderline? Mental doctors say it's autism and schizoaffective along with other stuff but it never really fitted me, went online, looked up mental disorders to see if something or somethings fit me better, I did find better labels, but the doctors don't give me a yes or a no if they fit me or not, I never truly got dismissed or denied for having a diagnosis so it's not truly hypochondria/health anxiety and I do have issues functioning in society aka not high functioning. So, I've given up looking for labels/diagnoses that accurately fit me now. I don't need medication. I don't need a therapist, I seem to be my best advocate because no mental health doctor seems to EVER FULLY understand my brain! I seem to be an atypical uncommon rare form of neurodivergence. Multiple Complex Developmental Disorder and Cycloid Psychosis with my Homocystinuria could be explanations.

The end.";;;;
2025-10-12 06:40:53;Am I Neurodivergent?;"I havent been tested for any sort of adhd autism etc so i just wanna make sure if my assumptions are correct.For years i have been doing things that i thought were normal but talking to more people i realize that mightve not been the case.

I tend to have very intense interests for (normally) short bursts of time. When I was incredibly fixated on haikyuu ,it was the only kind of content I could consume for a year. I have been fixated on space and aliens ever since i was a kid. My parents got me Discovery channel books about Earth,Space and Animals and the amount of pages that are crinkled because thats all i would read even during my exams over and over so much i could recite whats on which page number is still fascinating tbh. When I learned I might have autism or ADHD, I did HEAVY research on both and couldn't stop analysing my own behaviour or thinking about them at all. I'm still a bit like that tbh . if i find some true crime out there ill read the entire wikipedia page of every person related to that crime.if its a fandom i obsess over,i spend hours on fanfiction websites easily reading 20-30k word stories about any ships that would give me dopamine hits.i dive down into rabbit holes that take up 3 to 4 hrs of my useful time that shouldve been spent completing a deadline.then i get extremely anxious about not having completed the said deadline.for eg i started reading a novel series like 2 weeks before my highschool exams that would ultimately decide my entire career path.the obsession was so bad that i could not get anything done even after having completed the novels because thats all that would be in my head.that ultimately lead me to f up my exams i had a hard time getting into the college i wanted.there are many such examples.I frequently leave assignments till the last minute regardless of how much I want to get them over with, which is **stressful**. It doesn't matter how much I think about needing to do it, I physically can't until there's no other option.Even then, my brain will make me pick up ancient hobbies before it will let me start the damn thing . I'm constantly stimming in some way, and I think I only stop doing it when I'm being physically active enough or when something takes up my full attention (which is rare).

I also just cannot physically stop thinking. My brain is constantly on the go, though I struggle a LOT with focusing on what I actually need to focus on. I mainly blame this for why I really struggle to pay attention in class, to my friends or to my environment, and why I often feel very confused. It's very difficult to get to sleep because of how my brain is constantly thinking.

Very few things can keep my attention for long. I've got hundreds of tabs on my phone that I'm constantly switching between, trying to get a dopamine hit but getting bored too quickly of everything I try. I can't focus on what people are saying to me unless I'm deeply interested in the topic, and even then my attention drifts. Whenever my friends are talking and its something that doesnt really interest me I zone out their voices automatically in my head without even thinking and as soon as a word or topic catches my attention,i will ask about it,everytime,without fail,after the exact thing has been discussed like a minute ago.everytime.its not a joke with how often its been happening lately.dare i say i sound very dumb whenever this happens.and it happens every day.

theres one activity thats been bothering me my entire life and i think it gets in the way of me functioning normally.I like to pick on clothes.idk how to explain without sounding crazy but basically i like to pick on the stitched side of clothes and open the stitches with my nails.the easiest way to explain to you is how one feels popping bubble wraps. or sticking and unsticking velcro.its like an instant dopamine hit.i also notice i zone out so much while doing it my mouth starts watering and i look like a drooling cow.not that im drooling but i still get the feeling. once i start i genuinely cannot stop and i dont stop until that entire piece of cloth is ruined beyond redemption.i have destroyed countless socks,bras,tops and even a brand new set of sofa covers my mom bought.she was so mad she didnt let me on the sofa for a month.i also had my phone taken away.i still keep doing that a lot without even thinking.

i went into a deep dive on adhd and austism. im leaning more towards adhd that i might have. my symptoms include

* military grade procrastination-the more complicated ""I don't know where to start"" the more hardcore. Then panic-doing stuff last minute. Didn't matter if school or hobbies. motivation to do something is near impossible
* lack of interest until its OBSESSION - then boredom
* stimming (main one is biting the skin around my nails)
* impulsivity
* constant singing/narration outloud or in my head 24/7 constantly
* rejection sensitivity.very easy to ragebait if that counts
* no self discipline. Only do the work if someone else is expecting me to. 
* extremely curious about EVERYTHING
* extreme sleep problems(i stay up late doing NOTHING like doomscrolling even if i have to get up in 4 hrs and then my next day is shi cs i cant function properly)
* Sequential and procedural memory are shit (why I can't do math)
* unable to focus without background noise to drown out the narrator in my head
* i am very forgetful about important dates and deadlines due to which i have a notes widget on my home screen to remind me i need to pick up my laundry or ill srsly forget.i once took an entire week to make a birthday card for a dear friend and brought it to school the next day(on her bday).then forgot about her birthday.didnt even wish her for half a day.
* extremely verbally and physically impulsive,i can get verryy loud when im too engrossed in a topic im talking about and ill get so passionate i attract unwated attention and embarass my friends for the same reason
* not being able to easily comprehend and follow what people are saying in a conversation.listening to only what i want to listen subconciously.basically selective hearing?
* Having to reread the same sentences over and over until i finally understood (this made doing my studies extremely difficult bc i spend a huge amount of time just rereading).
* Getting an insane obsession for something/a hobby that would last anywhere from few days to years(yes this needed to be mentioned again)
* need for exact instructions. I need step by step list. I’m a VERY detail oriented person.
* doing simple tasks in a much more complicated way

thats pretty much all i could think of.its not possible for me to get a diagnosis right now so maybe i could get to know whats happening to me here.";;;;

2025-10-12 05:59:40;My way out of migraines;"Hi!

I got diagnosed with L1 autism this week. My migraines started at age 7 and lasted till age 21. In other words, for as long as I was in school.

I moved away, graduated, got a full-time home office job, started aerobics, went to therapy, cut contact with toxic people, developed a daily routine and the **migraines disappeared**. **Completely.**

I came to the devastating realization now, at age 24, that it was all due to sensory overload and trauma\*\*.\*\*  
Every day I was given painkillers like candy. I got told that my migraines can't be cured. This post is to raise awareness. There’s a chance a reality where you’re free from this nightmare does exist.";;;;
2025-10-12 04:46:40;Ok, so, now I know;I'm a 45 year old man, recently diagnosed level 1 ASD. I'm not sure what to expect, if anything.

2025-10-12 04:14:42;I wish NT people could understand NT vs ND behavior through a lens of cultural relativism;"I have an ADHD diagnosis and am pretty certain I also have Autism, though I haven't bothered to get evaluated. I've spent a good chunk of my life being regarded as a weird lil freak by NT people.

But it grates on my nerves how NT people often seem to understand it through a ""I'm normal, you're weird, so you should try to be like me"" framing.

No, dude.
Firstly, no offense, I don't want to be like you. Secondly, the only difference is that you exist in larger numbers so you get to dictate what is normal vs weird. To be completely frank: NT behavior seems just as weird to me as my own seems to them. ""Weird"" is a matter of context.

Furthermore, I feel like half of the shit they deem as ""weird ND behavior"" is actually pretty typical; like they do their OWN versions of it, it's just not pathologized when they do it.

As a few examples:

1. A common trait with ADHD is an intense hatred of dumb arbitrary rules; they drive me INSANE. However the second I say ""Why should I do that, it makes no sense. Why does *anybody* do it? This is so stupid"", you inevitably have a worked up NT person in your face going ""NOO THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS, YOU HAVE TO, NOOO""

Or they'll react similarly if I say ""I don't understand waiting for a set holiday to do [x], whats stopping you from doing it any other day of the year. If your family lives even slightly nearby, you can have Thanksgiving in June. You're an adult, who's gonna stop you"".
But that's not the rule, that's not how its done, we have to do it the correct way.

That strikes me as classic rigid thinking, but it's not framed that way when NT people do it. Not only is it not pathologized as such when an NT person does it, my criticism of dumb arbitrary rules *is* pathologized, even though to me it just feels like basic critical thinking skills. It's wild.

2. When Kathy comes into the office and makes a shitty joke about Mondays or ""being bad"" by taking an extra donut, everybody laughs. No one *actually* finds it funny, they're just going through the motions of a collective social performance.

It's a social ritual and, while NT people see it as completely normal, it seems *bizarre as hell* to someone like me.
But it's not characterized as ritualized behavior, that's only attributed to Autistic people.
Yet if you deviate from the social ritual or ask why they're even bothering, NT people become annoyed or uneasy, similar to how Autistic people react when you disrupt *their* version of ritualized behavior.

3. Stimming. Everyone stims. When you squeal with excitement, clap your hands and jump with joy, when drunk white girls scream ""WOOOO"": that's all stimming. Clapping when giddy is, like, *inches* away from hand flapping, yet one is pathologized and the other is normalized. 


4. Sure, yes, ND people often struggle to follow social norms/cues or we *do* understand them, but see them as a silly waste of time. However, NT people struggle to follow ND styles of socializing just as badly.

Like a lot of ADHD and Autistic people treat info dumping as a sign of affection, it's a love language--I'm so excited to share my hyperfixation with you, I hope it'll bring you as much joy as it brought me. Then you will infodump at me, which I will enjoy and appreciate in turn.

NT people don't understand it. Or they get what you're doing but find it dumb, annoying and, often times, flat out rude. Meanwhile, I'm standing there like ""Why are you mad at me for rambling about 17th century Florentine politics, don't you know you'll get a turn to ramble about your thing too? Don't you know anything??""
It's an alien social script to them, but one that feels very natural to ND people.

Or how we have a tendency to respond to someone with a personal anecdote. This is often framed by NT people as self-centeres and rude, but I feel like the implicit message of ""I'm demonstrating to you that I can empathize and relate to you by providing an example of a similar experience"" is very obvious. Yet it just goes right over their heads.


It's all subjective. I wish it could just be perceived as something akin to cultural differences and understood through a lens of cultural relativism.

Americans think the Chinese are weird for eating grasshoppers, but the French think Americans are freaks for eating peanut butter.
We each have our own concept of ""normal"" and we both engage in a lot of the same behaviors with slight variations. There is no such thing as a single, correct mode of behavior and it's idiotic to demand everyone conform to your own.

It's really not that complicated.";;;;
2025-10-12 04:11:00;I kind of want to be neurotypical;"Hey. I am almost 18 and I am in the middle of an autism assessment. My two therapists said I am likely to be autistic, but to be honest... As much as I have positive experiences with auties and love my aspergerian friends, the possibility of that diagnosis makes me feel... Defective? I of course don't think that ND folks are faulty in any way, but the fact that I may not be able to stop being lonely and even ""cringe"" in social environments makes my feel... Just faulty, tbh. Plus my thinking is often times different than others', which causes me to be even more annoying with my wrong assumptions. Not forgetting about all the other scheduling, stimming, interests and sensory stuff. I don't think my creativity re-compensates even in 50% for that I barely function after I come home. Sigh. I would rather be normal. I want to be normal, to be able to belong. Be able to freely connect with others, not to feel so much and to just... normally function, guys.

Please inform me about if I have said anything wrong here.";;;;
2025-10-12 03:01:04;neurodivergence vs. emotional suppression;"I apologize as this is lengthy but i haven’t found anyone who experienced this. I’m not sure what to do.

I am 16, undiagnosed, i’ve been wondering about nd for a while. I’m serious but I haven’t done anything because I don’t know if its reasonable for me to suspect it. I also feel like it’s unnecessary effort for others as people have never suspected nd out of me. i relate to people with ocd and the social aspect of autism (masking) but what i experience seems very subtle compared to others. ive always been 50/50 (and the online tests come out that way), and i just realized why. 

I don't know if what I'm experiencing is from emotional suppression or actual neurodivergence. I have a long history of emotional suppression growing up. it happened so early I can’t decipher or understand what even happened. im not sure if this long term emotional suppression has manifested into nd like traits or i really am nd. like nature vs nurture.

my earliest and most vivid memory is when i was 4. i chose to be mute in kindergarten and around my extended family. i had no reason to, i wasnt bullied, no one told me to. and when i found i had no other way to express myself, i cried.

Around 5-6, I went to counselling at a hospital, no one told me why. i seemed normal to them, but then again, i dont know if i was acting (masking). she asked me why I was talking to her normally and I responded with “I don’t know”. A few days ago, I told my guidance counsellor what I’ve been experiencing, she asked me the same thing and I had the same answer.

I don’t have much information from then, but I don’t think there was a strong conclusion. I did get diagnosed with anxiety though. I don’t know if a form of neurodivergence was overlooked or I actually don’t have it because I didn’t give them enough information.

all my most vivid memories of my childhood carry a bad feeling. I didn’t know how to express myself. I remember my mom asked me why I didn’t smile after she made an effort to take me to fun places, she asked me why I always looked sad. i remember crying but out of guilt. i knew that all my social problems made my mom feel like a bad parent, i knew she was trying her hardest.

Recently ——————
grade 11 just started, i had a heavy workload. i got bad grades and realized whats making school so exhausting. i realized why i don’t have enough time yet i continue to waste so much of it. i always experienced this but this heavy workload situation just made it more obvious:
- I can barely handle talking to friends at lunch. I used to force myself to stay with a group of people because I didn’t want to look alone, but now I just don’t care. I study at the library myself at lunch and I am way less exhausted mentally. I like being alone but I don’t like looking alone.
- I can never really focus in a lesson, like being in the room feels uncomfortable. I always sit in class and do nothing, teaching myself the material at home. I realize I can’t do this in grade 11 because I don’t have enough time. (I don’t know what to do about that). People in my class talk to me while doing work. They finish by the end of class while i have a blank page. my friends actually study better with each other, i always have to decline group study sessions.

i discovered how to express myself. i was always too afraid to write out of judgment, but now i like to journal. it feels like i have so many thoughts that don’t hold their meaning when i speak. i am still too scared to speak my mind, i don’t talk about feelings to friends or family. i only talk about feelings with myself but it is still so freeing. it has made such a big difference in my life, i am happier. But the people who know me well (parents) tell me I don’t regulate my emotions properly, i’m too sensitive, cry too easily. i don’t like it when they say that but i kind of agree. my friends rarely see me cry (if i do, they don’t know why). even though i express and understand myself better, i still get emotionally numb or super emotional - no in between. 

i have a list of symptoms or reasons as to why i suspect nd, it just keeps getting longer. but i dont know if its a result of my environment. i also thought these were common experiences?

——————

I talked to my guidance counsellor and she told me I could make a phone call to the doctors with her. I booked an appointment with guidance and it’s in three days, but I still don’t know whether my reason for suspecting this is reasonable. I don’t want to go through so much effort for a doctors appointment just to find out that I was making things up. I’ve never made a doctors appointment before (which is why im doing it with my guidance counsellor without my parents knowing. im 16, legal in Canada) im scared, should i do it?";;;;
2025-10-12 02:17:46;I am teenager undergoing evaluation for autism and ADHD and my parents are EXTREMELY unsupportive;"I've been suspecting that I am autistic for a while. I have some pretty debilitating sensory issues and I visited a general physician who strongly recommend getting an autism and ADHD diagnosis. She recommended a great psychologist and I am really grateful for that because good psychologists are really rare in my country. 

I am two sessions in with the psychologist and it has been established that I have strong autistic traits. I am quite happy because I feel listened to and I have accomodations at school now and the whole thing has made my life a lot easier.

My parents, on the other hand seem to think that I am taking all my symptoms. My psychologist had a long chat with them to get them to stop thinking this. They seem to have trouble accepting this whole thing and started belittleing me. Taking me to the psychologist is like a ""pay to make me shut up"" thing to them (for context, they are quite wealthy).

Did anyone else deal with similar issues when getting a diagnosis? How did you deal with them?";;;;
2025-10-12 02:17:34;Diagnosed at 40, can’t remember details of behaviour as a kid;"Sorry this is long! I was diagnosed with ASD last week at age 40. As a backstory, I’ve struggled with alcoholism and addiction for over 20 years but managed to get sober 21 months ago, and since then I’ve been like wow life is HARD. Not that it wasn’t before, but I didn’t have the wherewithal to pay this much attention. When things were hard, which I guess was all of the time, I drank or detached, or used other unhealthy coping mechanisms. 

Over the last 7 years, multiple therapists and neurodiverse friends have suggested maybe I should look into an assessment, often out of the blue to me, but I didn’t really know how to deal with the practicalities of that with everything else you have to do in life, so I kind of ignored it or brushed it off. Now, with nearly 2 years of sobriety behind me, my traits have become so pronounced I got the assessment and a diagnosis. 

I think I’m in the imposter syndrome/questioning phase of obsessively reading about autism and trying to relate it to my past. I can definitely see traits clearly in myself now, but I’m struggling to access my childhood and teen years. I read some school reports and I was basically amazing at school, loved learning, all great feedback. I remember having friends. I was definitely ‘fanatical’ about my interests (as my mum put it in my assessment), but it’s like I want a clear picture and I can’t remember properly. It’s like looking back on a film I can only half concentrate on, if that’s makes sense. I can’t get a hold on any details. 

I know what’s important is how I learn and manage my life now, so I’m not in this perpetual state of burnout and anxiety that’s ruining my life, but i’m struggling to get a grip on the diagnosis fully without being able to access myself. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe it’s just because I’m older and it’s normal not to know who you were as a kid, but not having clarity is giving me a lot of stress as I navigate it. 

TLDR: diagnosed ASD at 40 but can’t access my memories as a kid/teenager to give me a clear picture of who I am/was. ";;;;
2025-10-12 02:15:58;Aromanticism;"Hello. I was recently diagnosed with autism (level 1) only a few months ago. I had my doubts in the years before, I just didn't care if I was autistic or not. I used to believe it wouldn't make a difference in my life (m29, btw).

After the diagnosis, i started to think if one, or more of my characteristics were related to the spectrum. One of these is the title: Aromanticism. I don't want to pursue romantic relationships. I don't want to become a boyfriend/husband to anyone. I don't believe in love. (I'm not asexual).

Are those two things related? Are autistic people more prone to become aromantic or vice-versa? Maybe it's not that I don't want but with my lack of social skills/interactions, I never had the opportunity to have a glimpse of a romantic relationship that i like?";;;;
2025-10-12 00:52:13;Has anyone’s RSD or any other emotional problems actually gotten into the way of their opinions and decision making in life?;"I’m always suspecting inattentive ADHD in myself, my mom is diagnosed with it, I have symptoms my whole life, and both of my psychiatrist independently considered it. I used to cry every night for years as a child cause I felt like I didn’t have any friends, despite having a few and not being THAT bad socially.
Anyways I saw a TikTok saying “rich people when you call them rich instead of comfortable; angry person video”, and I felt like they didn’t like me and that is was targeted to me, I felt anger, sadness, but overall rejection. 

Mind you I’m pretty middle class, so it doesn’t even apply to me, so I gonna write an opinion on Reddit saying “calling people rich should be considered rude”";;;;
2025-10-12 00:40:49;Autism rhetoric;"Has anyone else noticed this rhetoric around autism that is level 1 and level 2 in the sense that level 3 should be autism and we should 'have a different label cos we're sucking up the support?'

I understand level 3 autism has whole other challenges but it really makes me sad that parents of level 3 children, think that those with level 1 and 2 are just quirky. Yes, ive seen quirky used many a time! 
Im a level 1 with 2 diagnosed kids, not levelled as they dont level kids here but one is level 1 and the other is level 2. To think people think our lives are quirky makes me so so sad. My relationship is in tatters, I no longer work, im home schooling 2 of the kids due to their needs. Like wow. Quirky is an insult.

I hate aspies had their label taken away. I myself relate to aspergers label more. I understand why it was removed but now we are being accused from our own community of taking space when we didnt ask for our label to be changed.

I personally think profound autism should be labelled as level 3 with learning disability/ies.
Is it the parents that dont want to have their child labelled as such? Autism is autism, yes there are levels but fundamentally, its the same beast.

This is really weighing on me because my justice sensitivity and rejection dysphoria are really making me aware.

2025-10-12 00:40:35;I used to collect;"Question, does collecting count towards the criteria even though it’s no longer something I do? When younger it definitely helped with emotional regulation, etc.

Late diagnosed 48 amab. Diagnosed with adhd 30 years ago. One of the things that was downplayed in my assessment this summer was collecting things. At this point I don’t really collect things, although getting rid of things can still be hard. When younger, even well into my 20’s I’ve realized that I collected quite a few things, but during the assessment process this didn’t immediately register.

What I was into collecting:

-Rocks - quite a collection of samples that I organized and had on display. They pretty much are all gathered in a bin in a shelf now.

-Warhammer minis: was obsessed starting around 12 with the OG rogue trader. Painted and collected for years. Displayed on shelves etc. Stopped in college, but restarted for 5-6 years in my 30’s early 40’s. Sorta starting again now. Still haul a lot of them around even though they just live in cases in shelves.

-Magic the gathering. Got really into it for two years in my teens in the early 90’s. My spouse convinced me to sell them a few years ago when we realized the value. Thousands of dollars worth that were being stored poorly, but still largely organized carefully into binders.

-Books. Books were an obsession starting in 2nd grade when I became a voracious reader overnight. I actually remember the exact moment I became what could be called hyperlexic. (The psychologist wasn’t too helpful in clarifying that.) I hauled my books around the country until my late 30’s when I gave up most of the collection. They were almost always organized on shelves. It was mostly sci-fi/fantasy paperbacks of little monetary value, but they were like dear friends. I’m now attached at the hip to my iPad as an e-reader, and not hauling books around is actually a relief in a lot of ways.

-Anime toys when I was in my 20’s going to con’s. I had a collection that used to be displayed, but eventually they were just hauled around the country and pretty much lived in boxes until my spouse convinced me to sell them.

As a middle aged person I don’t “collect” any longer, but I still struggle to let things go. I think I mostly am able to let things go, because when dealing with them it can become overwhelming (aka my adhd can’t cope). The reason the valuable stuff was sold is because my spouse handled much of the executive functioning to do so. It’s also funny that I still have enough imposter syndrome to even ask this. It doesn’t actually matter, just mostly curious.

2025-10-11 20:59:30;How do I stop mirroring people?;"Whenever I talk to anyone I find myself acting how they act I think as an attempt to seem “normal”. But because I do this all the time I feel like ive lost who I am, I dont know who I  am anymore. I was talking to a friend ive known for a veryyy long time on friday and he said to me “you’re so easy to talk to” and I had to stop myself from saying “its just you you’re talking to yourself”. As a result of this mirroring I cant talk to big crowds of people (unless ive known them for a very long time and we are close) because I wont be able to speak because I will be paralysed by anxiety and I will have zero clue what im supposed to say. Sometimes it feels like I have a script that I havent “written” but its in my head dormant ready to be used at any time. So when people are in big crowds or deviate from the script in another way its the equivalent of asking a robot a question that wasnt written into their code. Does anyone know how to stop doing this? I’m not sure when I started doing this but my theory is it started when I joined secondary school. Now, im 16 and I have joined college and I think the mirroring and masking has become so much more drilled into me and I feel mentally exhaused everyday to the extent that I had to start journaling or it felt like I would explode. I dont have a formal autism diagnosis (im on the waiting list) but I know that the people here might be able to help me. So, I would appreciate any sort of help you guys could give me.

2025-10-11 20:26:17;I’m considered attractive, but I’m too neurodivergent to be dateable;"I grew up being made fun of for being weird. I’ve always had a vivid imagination and had issues with being socially awkward. Even now, even though I love this about myself, I’m considered a strange individual. I’ve now been diagnosed with ADHD, and all of these things make sense now.
I’ve had many boyfriends because I’ve been considered pretty and cute, but they were always surface level, and I never had to spend a lot of time with them. At some point (around 16), the attraction to me wasn’t enough, because my personality was embarrassing to them. Nowadays, they no longer want to do anything serious with me. I’m hot enough to sleep with, but not normal enough to date. I’ve been stuck in multiple situationships due to this, and it breaks my heart. I know I have to learn to be more normal in public, but i want to be able to be appreciated in an intimate relationship. I want to change, but I don’t want to lose the part of myself that makes me me, no matter how cringy it is.";;;;
2025-10-11 16:26:15;I dont know what to do anymore;"I'm in a really tricky spot at the minute and I need the advice of ppl who are experienced with autism for this one. important to mention i'm not looking for a diagnosis here just advice.

Recently, I decided to take a gap year to save up money for uni the following year. However, i've been struggling. I always assumed that autism was a possibility, the last few months the ""signs"" have increased especially since taking the gap year.

For the gap year I had the task of looking for a job and this has worn me out massively.

I was looking through so many jobs but so many of them had things that I was just incapable of doing such as socialising. This made me question things. I've always been behind others in terms of social ability, i'm 19 and I've never had a job, have no friends and don't socialise, i've always felt different, have intense feelings regarding special interests, and I imagine if you asked the people in my life i've interacted with 90% would say that i'm autistic. I assumed that it was just social anxiety and that I needed to push myself. Whilst doing exposure therapy for my OCD I decided to also incorporate tackling my social anxiety at the same time. I would go on walks 2-3 times a day and try to put myself in uncomfortable situations, this didnt really work, when I was out on these walks I felt like my whole body was on fire, the sun outside was too exposing, I didnt know what to do with my hands where to look ect. Also, it didnt seem to be getting any easier as expected with exposure therapy for social anxiety. After this period I then went back to college and I was alone every single day, I didnt make a single friend, I tried to speak but I just couldn't, my body constantly felt on fire, I didn't know what to say, I felt like my true self was too deep and honest for other ppl.

Now, a couple months after finishing college and spending the last few months applying for jobs I think I'm going through something which is called autistic burnout.

I haven't left the house in several months because i dont want my body to feel on fire again. I'm not depressed, I just feel trapped. I'm spending more time alone, stimming more (something i've never really done). Even around my family I cant bring myself to look them in the eyes and engage in conversation. Showering is bothering me more than usual, waking up late because procrastinating getting in the shower my body feels sore a lot of the time.

I'm really cautious of self diagnosis and im scared that this might be my ocd playing a trick on me, making me avoid discomfort of socialising hiding behind autism as an excuse.

But i really feel like i;m autisic.

Im currently awaiting a diagnosis. It's getting so bad that im going to see a neurodivergent specialist.

My questions are?

How do I know this is autism and not anxiety, because theres a niggling voice in my head telling me I need to just push myself.

Do i go outside? (I really dont want to)

2025-10-11 11:47:25;meltdowns and masking;"Hi, first of all sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language

I’m a girl, not diagnosed for personal reasons (lack of support from my family, emotional and monetary speaking), but i’m autodiagnosed (i’ve done my research), but sometimes i feel like my symptoms are not the same as others (in specific situations) and often i tend to feel invalidated, for example, can meltdowns last minutes? my meltdowns often last from 5 to 10 minutes, most of the time i tend to hurt myself from scratching my skin so hard, but i’ve always seen many autistic people saying their meltdowns last hours and they’re not short, so can meltdowns be short?

Also, i’ve seen that i’m also high masking even in my house, for context, I’m 21, in university, living with my parents (im from mexico) and i don’t have a job yet (i’m actively looking for one), but my parents haven’t seen me having a meltdown or knowing my struggles in my life (socially speaking and such because i dont really hace much confidence or trust in them), i really don’t remember most of my infancy, so i can’t really speak if they’ve witnessed any in my childhood, but is this something normal or that other people do? i feel like they will think im over reacting or that i’m ridiculous, has anyone ever felt or done this? :(";;;;
2025-10-11 09:41:45;My new Glasses keep making me stare into my own eyes and I am desperately trying not to toss them across the room. What can I do to stop making eye contact with myself?!?;"Hello all. 

To start, the too long Did not read version of this is my new glasses are jump scaring me with my own eyes making eye contact and I would like advice on how to stop these undesirable staring contests. 

The longer version is this.For context I am not diagnosed with Autism but I doubt all my non neurotypical traits can be blamed on ADHD. One of which is the Oh So Common ""discomfort when making eye contact."" Some days It is mild and I am able to mask, in my opinion, decently. But other times I feel I might as well have a basket or bag over my face because I am absolutely not looking anywhere near a face because too painful. Hopefully that makes sence

Well to try and make my long winded phrasing and descriptions as brief and to the point as possible, I just got my First pair of glasses! I have known this was coming for some time so I had done a lot of mental prep and am excited and Ready to use my new Accessibility aid. However I did not account for the possibility of the glasses in certain light reflecting my own eyes staring back at me! Today has been my first day with my glasses and I have been startled by the sudden Starring contest with my own eyeballs 7 times already! 3 of them all in a few minutes as I have the dimmer evening lights on. Not only are these self staring contests supper uncomfortable and upsetting, but I am worried that if this happens on a bad day I will end up ripping my glasses off my face a breaking them as I try to get the offending eyes far away from me. So any advice on how to prevent seeing your own eyes reflection making eye contact with you?

2025-10-11 07:33:15;Doctor shopping;"I work in a school, and I want to share an anecdote that isn't an isolated incident. 

We have a student in Year 6 and since kindergarten they have been aggressive, rude and don't take responsibility for their actions. 

Each year, the parents have been involved to come up with strategies to support the student. They are of an Arabic background, and the father is very aggressive and dismissive and encourages the child to engage in physical aggression if the child feels aggrieved. I include the cultural information because this is a theme with families I've worked with from this background. 

Anyway, throughout this child's time at school, the parents have seen no less than 5 different psychs to try and get a diagnosis of AuDHD. They have finally got a diagnosis - not based on teacher observations, but from an external health professional who has seen the child a handful of times.

Now, the child is brandishing the label as an excuse to be na absolute shite. The parents see it as an excuse to justify the child's behaviour and blames the school for causing the behaviours. 

This isn't the only time I've seen this happen in my career. In fact, it's increasing. 

As someone who has worked with kids with genuine disability, I really struggle with this kind of thing. 

I'd be interested in your opinions about what measures could be put in place to stop this stuff? Four professionals said this child has no condition. Yet one finds differently? Surely the diagnostic process is problematic if it can allow for this? ";;;;

2025-10-11 05:55:40;Struggle with making friends;"Hi there, so, I'm 23 years old, female, diagnosed with aspergers/asd. About 2 years ago I left an abusive relationship (with a man, 3 years) and kind of started life from scratch after that, besides that my teenage years were complicated all around, didn't have a stable home etc.

After that I went to therapy and I'm honestly pretty good now, I'm not depressed or anything anymore, like I can manage my emotions. I have a boyfriend who I love very much, started dating 5 months ago and we just clicked, very healthy relationship. I'm studying (I was working before but stopped about 1.5 years ago, total life reset) and will begin to work next year. So, everything is good.

The one thing though, is that I really struggle with friendships. During the abusive relationship my ex really isolated me and I ended up loosing the friendships I had before that (which also weren't super many, I moved countries as a kid and due to that + bullying + aspergers i always struggled with making friends) and now, even though like I said, I'm doing fine, sometimes I feel sad about not really having friends. Like, I have some people that are sort of my friends,  but I don't have a best friend or a friend group or many friends and I generally don't hang out much with anyone. I study online so I don't go to class either. Honestly my dog is my best friend and I will often go out with him and do things.

I'd want to have friends but I don't know how to make them, and even when I start talking to someone it's like I don't know what to do or how to make it progress from there on. It's not social anxiety per se, it's more that even though i do sort of ok in social situations, I dont know how to turn that into a friendship. Also I'm not so sure if I want friends or if I'm just jealous of other people having friends. I'm sometimes a bit jealous of my boyfriend (not autistic btw) having friends too I think. 

And yeah, I guess I just wanted to get this out there and see if anyone would have any advice for me, and, well, if anyone would want to be friends, that works too!! I'd be happy to try to make new friends, even if online, and it feels like it'd be kind of easier with people who understand my issue.

So anyways, like I said I'm 23, female
 I live in Europe, studying web programming, I like anime, animation in general, some video games, animals, and discussing politics and world issues (i respect everyones opinions and enjoy debating)

2025-10-11 05:47:34;I feel like im just missing something;I just got diagnosed with autism, adhd, mdd, and cptsd in July at age 33. I discovered im level 1 autistic while trying to figure out why im constantly burnt out by going to school or having a normal 9-5 40hr job. Im still trying to understand it all, and fight back against my burn out so I can survive. But everything I've read makes me feel insanely hopeless and despondent. The best advice I've seen was that I'll basically always feel that way and I just gotta hold out for a glimmer of hope. But thats what I've been doing this whole time, and genuinely, another 30 years of that seems...undesirable. Ive looked into energy accounting, radical acceptance, trying to do decompressing things or focus on my hyper interests. But theres just this feeling of idk, like a black hole in my chest. I just need some validation or a dose of reality lol is anyone else feeling this way? What have yall found that helps?;;;;
2025-10-11 05:28:14;How to stop feeling rotten;"Hiya there. I'm neurodivergent, have a mix of anxiety, depressive episodes, and obsessive tendencies. I'm also probably somewhere in the autistic spectrum, but not officially diagnosed. I think one of the things that really caracterise me is an obsession with morality, with being a good person. Whenever I believe I have harmed someone or maybe disappointed them I have a meltdown and sink into a heart wrenching sadness. I definitely feel too much, and often I feel others' feelings very intensely. I crave to help, and wish I had control over others' feelings because I want everyone to be okay. 

Right now I feel quite rotten. I feel things were better before, when life had not messed me up this much. When I was not so ashamed of being myself, when I was creative and engaged in hobbies. Now I feel like a useless blob, who can barely do anything. I've stopped consuming media, music, books. I feel unauthentic, and I'm so affected by people. What can I do? I want to go back.";;;;

Anyways I saw a TikTok saying “rich people when you call them rich instead of comfortable; angry person video”, and I felt like they didn’t like me and that is was targeted to me, I felt anger, sadness, but overall rejection. 

Mind you I’m pretty middle class, so it doesn’t even apply to me, but I was gonna write an opinion on Reddit saying “calling people rich should considered rude”, but then I realized this might be RSD so I stopped. ";;;;
2025-10-11 03:51:12;Any experience with Armodafinil?;"I hope this is the right place to ask about this. I am 21 years old and was diagnosed with AUDHD about a month ago. I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder for four years before this, but this psychiatrist said that the medications I had been taking were not suitable for treating the problems I described to him. After establishing a new diagnosis, he prescribed Armodafinil and also Sertraline, which I had been taking before. I can't say anything about Sertraline, because I don't feel constant, unreasonable anxiety, and that's good, but Armodafinil doesn't seem to do anything. I've only been taking it for two weeks, so maybe that's not long enough for it to start having any effect, but I've seen people describe noticeable effects on their bodies, while I see nothing. It's supposed to be a boost of energy and relieve drowsiness, but it does neither. I've had insomnia for a long time; I can't fall asleep at all, even when I'm very tired, so I take Quetiapine (25 mg) at night, and it helps. I don't think the Quetiapine makes me sleepy, because no matter how many hours I sleep, my condition remains the same. The only thing I can possibly associate with taking Armodafinil is loss of appetite. I usually eat well and quite fillingly, but for the last week, I haven't felt like eating anything at all, even though I'm hungry. I don't even want to eat my comfort foods. So I would like to hear any experiences with Armodafinil because it is actually quite expensive for me and I don't want to spend money on something that doesn't help me.";;;;
2025-10-10 22:55:49;I did it! Booked my initial appointment to get assessed.;"So yeah! After a therapist told me to consider I might be autistic it kinda rocked and changed my world and made so many things about my life make sense.

Does anyone know what the process is like getting a diagnosis in Ontario or greater Canada? I don’t really know what to expect.";;;;
2025-10-10 21:20:53;issues in relationship, please help;"tldr: issues in relationship (intimacy, negativity, jealousy). any tips on how to better manage a relationship? especially if the partner is neurotypical? 

i am currently in the process of getting a diagnosis (i find out on wednesday!) but ive been struggling a lot in my relationship, i know its starting to wear my boyfriend down and im terrified. i dont want to make him miserable but i dont want to lose him. 

we’ve been living together for about a year now, we were long distance before this. things were great for the first 6 months we lived together, we were living at his parents house. after we got to our own place things kinda got rough. i was also working two jobs while we were living at his parents house.. we also go to visit my family about every 6 months, it’s a 20 hour drive and my house is very loud and chaotic so as you can imagine very stressful. so i think a combination of what i think was masking all the time and so much stress from work has led me to be in what i think is burnout. 

after about 6 months of living together we started to have “arguments” over the same things on what feels like a weekly basis. the main issues are:

-me “over reacting” to seemingly small things (after thinking about it i feel like most of the time this is when plans change even if it’s slight or if ive been very stressed out all day) 

-me being sensitive to touch and very particular about it when i am able to tolerate it (this has really impacted intimacy)

-me doing or saying things that are rude (he thought i was trying to avoid him because i will ask him to change because his clothes smell like outside, i will ask him to wash his face because it smells like sunscreen, i will say things as jokes or just saying something and he thinks i was being rude) 

-issues with communication, often times i bottle everything up until it comes out as a big reaction. when he bring issues up to me i often shut down, it’s hard for me to talk, i end up just staring at the wall and trying to come up with every possible solution. if they all get shut down it turn into me having very dark thoughts

-he says i’m very negative about most things, either things he does, we do, or things he says, or just in general. he feels like he can never do the right thing for me. and a lot of the times he doesn’t even really want to come home because he knows i’m gonna be in a bad mood (which is just me being absolutely drained from work and coming home to see a ton of chores that need to be done) 

-the most recent issue that came up is my jealousy towards his best friend. my boyfriend and this friend hang out every day while im at work. he helps my boyfriend let out our dogs (something i always do on my own, it just feels like i have to share my home and my family with this friend) then they usually go to the gym or something. i am feeling extremely jealous because i feel like this friend gets to spend more time with my safe person and dogs in my safe place more than i do. this friend will also call my boyfriend while him and i are in the middle of doing something and my boyfriend will answer it and be on the phone for at least 30 mins. my boyfriend also always talk about him. i’ll try to tell my boyfriend things about autism, things i relate to so he can understand me better and he just brings up this friend, so it feels like im an afterthought and like our time together has to involve this friend in some way 

he says he feels more like my caretaker or parent rather than my boyfriend. i don’t want him to not want to come home, plan things he wants to do around my emotions, blow up at him, shut down on him, not be able to provide the intimacy he needs and wants (his love language is touch). he is getting fed up because we talk about things and they don’t change. im in therapy, ive done dbt in the past, seeing a psychiatrist, reading books, constantly researching, im doing everything i can but nothing seems to work. 

during our last “argument” over me being jealous about his friend he told me i was being toxic and manipulative. he was telling me this friend was going on a date(which he told me earlier in the day over snapchat) and i made what i thought was a joke or exaggeration about how i hope they move in together soon. i was frustrated because this resentment has been building for a while but ive never said anything about it. he said it was toxic because i was wishing he would be just like me and have no friends but that’s not what i was going for i was just hoping maybe if this friend gets a girlfriend he will stop calling my boyfriend while we’re trying to spend time together. 

i’ve been told i have bpd traits in the past so i don’t know if these issues could be a result of autism, bpd, or both. but i guess im asking if anyone has any tips on how to be a better partner? how to better communicate with my partner? how to let go of this resentment? i just feel like every misunderstanding, every time i can’t stand touch, every time i have a reaction is going to be his final straw. i just want to be a good partner to him but at times i feel like im not capable. i feel like im too much but not enough all at the same time ";;;;
2025-10-10 19:28:48;Division Among Autistic People of Differing Support Needs;"
It bothers me to see autistic people on the Internet make generalizations about other autistic people with differing support needs. It seems like some people with level 1 autism/less substantial support needs are envious of people with level 2 or 3 diagnoses/more substantial support needs because they believe it means they have easier access to support and more resources directed towards them. Some late-diagnosed people also equate it with being diagnosed at a younger age with early access to support. 

There’s also the trend where people point to characters like Sheldon Cooper or Sam from “Atypical” and say these depictions are too stereotypical, even though many people resonate with them. People both want to embrace autism and shy away from more outward presentations. While the narrative that these are the only ways autism can look is harmful, it is also harmful to shun “stereotypical” characters that many autistic people relate to.

I’ve also seen that there is a misconception among some autistic people with more substantial support needs that people diagnosed as level 1 don’t struggle as much because of the ability to mask or blend in, can’t be “visibly” autistic, and can’t have support needs that vary or show up in less obvious but still serious ways. 

In my opinion, we are all closer in relation to each other regardless of support needs than we would ever be to non-autistic people. It doesn’t make sense to resent and alienate each other based on a lack of understanding.";;;;
2025-10-10 19:11:09;How’s your life as a person with autism in your state, country?;"Hi there! I live in a country in Asia and was unofficially diagnosed with autism (the doctor said 99% sure, no doubt! but no official documentation). I know Asia, especially East Asia, is relatively comfortable for ppl like me to live our own way, but I still struggle to enjoy my life. I often feel like ppl building fences around themselves, and can’t communicate well, and end up feeling isolated both physically and emotionally. So I’m thinking about moving to another country (not right now, but for my future).

I’ve visited several countries, the US, UK, the Philippines, UAE, and Turkey. From my experience, I haven’t really seen ppl who seem autistic. Are they just masking absolutely well? Or just staying home?

This is just my curiosity. What’s your everyday life like where you live? How do you handle challenges like finding a well-paid job, making friends, or getting married?";;;;
2025-10-10 17:22:24;Does my coworker secretly hate me for no reason? :(;"Hello! to preface, I work in a fashion retail store and i'm a visibly/out queer 24NB person diagnosed with auDHD and anxiety/depression. my other coworkers are 30F (manager), 24M (assistant manager), 25F, 22F, and 29M (other salespeople like me). I get along perfectly fine with everyone. We're not besties who talk all the time but we work together fine, complete our tasks, and make some silly chill convo when there's no customers. Everyone other than the 29M, James, who acts very weird around me. I'm the newest person in the store as of now but i've been there for 3 months. He's been there since last December so a bit less than a year. 
I don't mask, and everyone including him knows i'm queer and neurodivergent (4 of the others are also gay/lesbian, James is cishet) but I don't think this is the problem they all talk normally with James and make jokes with him. 
At first I thought it might have to do with me being new and needing to get to know him but be straight up never talks to me, and every time I do try to talk to him he either answers bluntly, makes no attempt to continue the conversation, or flat out tells me to ""walk away from him"". He might show something on the work monitor or on his phone to someone else and when I walk to look as well he hides the screen. When he thinks I do something wrong (which is 99% of the time a misunderstanding after I explain it to him) he instantly gets angry and goes on to blame me. 
When I ask him about how to do something he looks at me irritated and says something along the lines ""what do you mean, you should already know that"" (which is against what our manager has told every one of us). Lately he's been more and more adamant about me ""leaving him alone"". 
I suck severely at being social and my skills in that regard are very regressed however I in no way think i'm being annoying towards him. I've only attempted to talk to him like 3-5 times with a bit of success but his tone always seemed blunt and judgemental.
The weirdest thing is that he's also helped me when I've had an anxiety attack, and asked me if I want food or coffee and brought me some bought with his own money numerous times, so I have no idea what his feelings are towards me. I'd be inclined to believe that his ""good"" actions are just social niceties just so the other coworkers can't realise he hates me, but otherwise as someone too autistic to read people and their intentions, he's genuinely baffling to me. 
At first I thought that in general, he was joking and I tried to pass his behavior off as just cishet guy ""humor"", considering I've never had many male friends so I have no idea how they act lol.
Like I said above, he's good with everyone else who works here and makes perfectly normal conversation with them but when he's with me he acts irritated, gives me zero help when it comes to customer service, and doesn't attempt to talk to me. 
There's even many instances where his friends have come over and he's always smiling and hugging them.
Considering he's resigning in 2 months, I don't really care in the long run but until then, our interactions make me lowkey uncomfortable :/
I also have zero clue how and if I have to bring this up to him since his behavior and personality makes it clear that there's no reason for us to be friends, making me think I shouldn't attempt this.
Does it sound like he dislikes me or is it just his personality??

2025-10-10 16:21:28;I want to get diagnosed, but I don’t want my dad to find out. Any advice?;"Hello! I’m an 18 year old female and I have speculated that may have autism since I was in middle school. I’m an adult now and I really want to finally find out for sure, but I know my family won’t be supportive.


I want to get an official diagnosis but I’m not sure how to go about it. I’m 18 so I don’t really have my own doctor. I live with my dad but I feel like if I ask my dad if I could get an autism screening he will get mad and feel like I am just making stuff up. I told my sister a few years ago that I thought that I may be autistic and she told me that I was exaggerating and that I shouldn’t go around self diagnosing myself. I feel like my dad will react the same.

Is there a way that I could maybe consult a professional online? Like speak to a doctor through zoom or something? I just feel like if I go to my family with these concerns they will feel that I’m being silly, but honestly I just want to finally know for sure if I actually am autistic. I have been feeling alienated from my family for the longest time because of the way that I act and the way that I feel, like when I talk about things that I like like Batman or comic books they always make fun of me for being so excited about it, or when I accidentally do or say something rude I’m scolded even though I never mean to be rude. And my senior year of high-school was really hard on me because I had a lot of trouble making friends and interacting with people at my new school. 

Im not asking anyone here to diagnose me, I want to talk to a professional, I just feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t know for sure. Is there anything anyone suggests? If you were or are in my situation how did you handle it?";;;;

I have been thinking about redownloading Hinge after a few years. Last time I didn't have my adhd or autism diagnosis yet, so obviously I didn't mention it on my profile. I have been thinking that it might be easier if I told it straight away because I would like to date people who understand autism or at least truly want to understand. Do you have any ideas how should I do it? I'm a lesbian so I'm not that afraid of those whose fetish autistic people because at least in my life all of them have been men. If you have told you are autistic/neurodivergent on your dating app profiles, how did you do it and how did people react? ";;;;
2025-10-10 13:55:25;Do I need a medical certificate to prove that I’m autistic?;"I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) without intellectual disability at the age of 27 and a half.
My psychiatrist, who specializes in autism, asked me if I wanted him to issue a medical certificate to confirm that I’m autistic, but I told him it wasn’t necessary.

Now I’m wondering  is it actually required to have a medical certificate that proves you’re autistic? Or is the psychiatrist’s diagnosis itself enough?

2025-10-10 13:48:57;Suspicions of level 1 autism, but fear of stereotyping symptoms & thinking I’m faking due to doubt from NT parents. Help provide a non biased opinion?;"I am a 20 year old female and I suspect that I might have autism.

My mom told me that I had a hyperfixation during my toddler ages, and she saw no other toddler have as big of an interest. She pointed out repeatedly that I rock back and forth bc I don’t notice, and I also do it if I’m excited or in pain, as a self-soothing action. My dad has even pointed out that I do weird motions with my hands and arms if I’m walking while listening to music, including pacing back and forth through the upstairs hallway repeatedly. 

I show repeat negative response to foods like applesauce and black eyed peas because I hate pasty or mushy foods, and the texture has made me vomit before. I hate hard, grainy textures because of how they feel if I accidentally run my fingernails over them. Best I can describe it as is an unpleasant vibration through my fingernails that makes me shiver. I have to scratch a fabric texture I like and feel it bunch up under my fingernail to make me forget the unpleasant texture. I have a compulsion to repeatedly set down or close objects until they either hit the desk completely flat or make a pleasing sound. Most social rules make me feel like I’m losing my mind trying to account for, and it’s even worse when talking. It feels like jumping through hoops trying to catch how I say things mid-conversation. I have been to a social group for other NT individuals and have repeatedly related to other diagnosed autistic people.

I haven’t noticed my executive thinking skills improve in the past 4 years (it might’ve been more, but I only just started keeping track).  I have an obsessive fear of being misunderstood, so I compensate by being overly verbose and work myself to tears over the possibility of being misunderstood, and often immediately assume people don’t want to be my friend if they ever do misunderstand me. Social interactions make me actively exhausted and I have to leave to decompress, sometimes even going outside.

My mom keeps sowing doubt by saying that “they probably would’ve said you’d have Asperger’s back then, but they don’t even have that anymore, so it’s probably just quirkiness”. She says this despite the fact private school dampened most of my traits.";;;;
2025-10-10 13:40:46;Autism and struggling with world system;Okay I’ll start saying I’m not diagnosed but I think I am on the spectrum for a various number of reasons , one of them being this topic(?), I feel like it resonate with it pretty much. I always thought of this when I was very little, when other kids would never even think of this. Right now tho I experienced it firsthand. So my question is how are we supposed to do this? Like a 9-5 job go home have absolutely no time at all and repeat. The same thing over and over forever?? Like yes maybe there is a little chance u will gain money and stop but for that u still need to do some years on 9-5. What is the point of all of this. Idk I don’t understand how other ppl are not freaking out at this… maybe they complain sometimes but then it seems like its not a big problem…the just accept it and some of them are even happy to do so… ,ppl near me expect me to do the same but i feel like they just dont understand and call me lazy… but i think its not that, it’s not that i dont try i try and then i crash out. Then ppl ask me what will u do then? I actually would love to do nothing. Maybe art, but it is not fun if it’s a job.I actually would love to do a bunch of things if ppl didn’t tell me how and when .;;;;
2025-10-10 13:12:57;Perspectives from a recently happier Aspie;"First, let me acknowledge that everyone's situation is different and what helped me, may not help you. That said, my goal is to share my perspective as a middle aged man for whom my autism self-acceptance had been life changing for me. Second, as a physician nothing I say here is medical advice or formal information. In fact, I no longer practice and have never been licensed. Please do not modify yours or anyone's treatment without consulting with their doctors 

I recently received my first informal* but highly probable diagnosis after years of struggling with ""depression and anxiety"". I had tried a variety of SSRIs, an anti-psychotic here or there, and other meds to manage my symptoms. However, it never felt quite right. I'd be really happy at work or at home, and the smallest piece of negative information involving my emotions would destroy me. For a while I believed they were panic attacks but in hindsight were melt downs. The meds helped but not completely. I had been engaged in formal psychiatric care on and off since my first year of med school when symptoms began in earnest and decided to try therapy. 

While I did have to shop therapists to find one I was congruent with (many were faith based even if not advertised as such), eventually finding one who used a mix of cbt and mostly free form psychoanalysis almost, we began coming to the shared idea that perhaps I was on the spectrum. I had a horrible speech impedement as a child, was reading super early and had an intense fascination with medicine. I currently work in a very niche scientific field as a researcher. I constantly fidget, have delayed emotional responses, very sensitive to criticism,  and can monologue (e.g. this post). These are all things I had hated that I could not fix. My medical training implied that either the meds or diagnosis were wrong but I had never considered ASD lol.

Curiously, being a doctor on the spectrum is not only not that uncommon but was also useful/detemental regarding masking. In some ways, interacting with a large group of very different people via patient interactions is surprisingly good exposure therapy to the ways of neurotypicals. While this is masking, it sort of made working with NTs in my every day life more easy for me. Before my 'dataset of interactions' I was very clumys socially something my wife will attest to. That said, turns out I like playing with the human system if you will, rather than managing patients. That, combined with my recent marriage i decided to switch jobs. I mention this for a few reasons: 1. I feel that many high achieving individuals are pushed into careers for the wrong reasons (our tendency to mask can make saying no to these pressures hard), 2. If you can socialize in a formal environment, practicing scripted conversations did translate into better real world social skills. Maybe volunteer work for those able to do it in structured environments can be an idea? But masking is tough, and even more so, if you arent aware you do it. 3. Many people will never notice the mistakes and details we do, both about ourselves (i was and still am very self conscious) and in others. Love yourself!

Detour aside, after speaking with my friends at my doctor's suggestion about this possibility, the reactions were hilarious. My friends, who lean medical, were ""duh, of course you are on the spectrum"". They were also quick to mention times that they did compensate for me. Famously, when I would be coding, the most attractive woman in the class could be hitting on me and I would not notice for instance, and my friend had to explain I was in 'the zone'. I mention this because many with autism may feel inadequate, but there are people out there who will accept you for who you are but it can be hard to find them :(. However, outside of high school it got considerably easier. These anecdotes and friend recollections, while not diagnostic were insightful and useful. 

My parents were considerably less recepting to the inquiries. In their defense, they are going through alot in their own lives, but they unfortunately are stuck in the pre-spectrum paradigm, so having good grades equaled no developmental disorder. Perhaps its my literal thinking or my training, but the idea that the paradigm needs updating is something that may come less naturally to some people, doubly so neurotypicals. It was a painful but ultimately cathartic experience. I fortunately have the luxury of being independent of my parents so ymmv. I hope they will become more accepting in the future but their perspecive on mental health is antiquated in general. So be cautious who you share with but forgiving them, did silence some of my self criticism (I inherited their poor outlook on mental health). I will let them figure out the genetics implications their own.

I haven't decided if I want to pursue a diagnosis officially officially, but my psychiatrist agrees as well. Regardless the tools recommended for our community have helped me considerably. For instance, exercise has been a great boon as has carving out time for myself. Reducing masking - As a grade A masker, this was hard but saved my life. Not saying my choicefor testing is wise or correct, just where I am currently. 

Anyways, this is long but I wanted to share. Ive seen many happy and negative stories here, figured I would share a hopefully happy one

I had a medical waiver get denied due to unspecified mood listed on my medical records. When I was around 8 or 9, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. However, recently me and my therapist have concluded that it was autism the entire time. Reason being, I was told to slowly stop my medication by my doctor and have done absolutely wonderful off of them. 

In a nutshell, I need to prove to the military I’ve never had schizoaffective disorder. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. ";;;;

I’ve gotten so good at masking it feels like i can almost  turn it on and off, and its gotten to the point where i dont know how i would naturally act.

But my point for this post is to ask if other people also don’t always like other neurodivergent people. I feel like my neurodivergent ways get in the way of liking other neurodivergent people because I find them annoying. Like they re-explain something someone just said or they take forever to talk. 
This drummed up because of a guy in my class he has adhd and maybe some other things as well but I just find him truly annoying. He also can’t take a hint to stop talking.

2025-10-10 03:52:12;Do I really lack emotions?;"Hi.

Just for context, I have no formal diagnosis of ASD. I personally suspect I'm on the spectrum, and I only told a couple of friends - and nobody from my family.

I live partially alone, partially at my parents'. My mother works in a family owned shop.

Tonight I was having dinner with my parents, and my mum asked why I never visit her at the shop; I replied that I see no point in going there, since we already see each other at dinner and I don't want to go outside.

She then muffled something about ""the Asperger spectrum"" (sic) claiming I lack emotions and that I'm too rational.

Does any of this make sense to you? Has anything similar happened to you? Would a ""normal"" person do that, or is she just overreacting?

Thanks in advance for the replies :-)";;;;

I am in the UK and the assesment process is shit. Only way I can say. My process started in January, all i know is that I have something, most likely autism/ general neurodivergence, and it is pissing me off so much. Part of my ‘autism’ is that I cant really lie, so when I explain to people why I am the way I am, I cant say ‘its autism’ until I am diagnosed. That will not be happening for months atleast. What do I do in general??? I hate college which I just started, I love politics but cant debate anyone because Im so opinionated, I love art and want to be an artist but hate having focus on me, I dont know how to make friends because ive nearly always been bullied and therefore always assume their becoming my friend to take the piss, I dont know how to stop my current friends from taking the piss out of me (obviously as a joke but i dont know how to deal with it). This is just the tip of the iceberg and have no one really to speak to about it so hopefully you guys enjoy my rant.;;;;

2025-10-09 23:36:05;Recently diagnosed, trying to understand;"So I was diagnosed in the beginning of June. I'm 34 as of end of September. It obviously hasn't solved anything but has given me a lot of answers as to why I am the way that I am. 

One thing I'm struggling with is how to deal with meltdowns, as I'm now recognizing them. 

I'm pretty much always alone, so I'm okay at getting myself out of them, but I don't always understand what causes them. 

My biggest one recently happened in my kitchen when a spider dropped onto me from the ceiling. I have severe arachnophobia due to my brother putting a black widow spider in my bed when I was 5 (he was 7). I wasn't bit, but since then, it doesn't matter the size. 

That meltdown only ended because I realized my arms were turning red. I'm allergic to shellfish and whether it was the autism or my adhd, I realized I looked like a lobster and didn't want to be allergic to myself, and somehow managed to calm down enough to get up to my room and to my bed, which I like to say is my safe space. But after that, I couldn't enter the kitchen for over a week. I don't know if that's normal, or if the fact I typically don't eat for days after a meltdown is also normal, though my googling says it's not uncommon.

I'm also hoping someone has some tips for dealing with overstimulation due to long hair. I don't currently have a job and can't get a haircut at, which I know would be the smartest option. The issue is my hair is just the final tipping point sometimes and I've had two mini melts this week alone. 

I just need advice. I've done a lot of research and until I can get health insurance again to resume my therapy appointments, I'm at the mercy of Google and honestly it's a bit overwhelming. 

I know it's a lot to read, and probably nothing will come of this, but I feel like I'm about to start drowning. ";;;;
2025-10-09 21:03:33;I feel like I always need a hug;"A little background, I’m 27F and I was born in 1998, back then doctors didn’t really understand autism like we do today, especially in women. 
When I was about two years old, I was supposedly diagnosed with a “sensory disorder”. At least that’s how my family describes it. Unfortunately, because of moving around several times and having a general misunderstanding of what a sensory disorder meant, I do not have the medical records of this doctor visit that supposedly happened. I did get prescribed Ritalin as a child so I could have had ADHD. But I’m unsure as an adult if I still have ADHD or if I have SPD or ASD.

The symptoms of my “sensory disorder” or as followed. 

-as I get older, I am becoming more sensitive to high-pitched noises such as alarms, sirens, screaming, and screeching. I still love going to rock concerts and loud places, but I prefer to have some sort of ear protection.

-I have a wide range of special interest that all fall under the category of fine art (music, dancing, singing, sketching, coloring, sculpting, etc.)

-I have a difficulty making friends and the friends that I do make, it typically takes me a long time to open up to them. 

And finally the main point of this whole post, I am hyposensitive to touch. I’m constantly seeking touch. I typically don’t have much response to temperature differences. I do get too hot and too cold sometimes but I’m typically the one wearing the least amount of layers or can stand being in a 80° humid Florida heat without much complaining or water. When I get nervous or anxious or I’m in an uncomfortable situation I find myself holding my own hands, rubbing my own arms playing footie with myself.
I’ve ended up in a lot of unhappy relationships that I think I’ve been misguided because I’m trying to seek cuddling as a form of emotional regulation. 

Basically, I feel like with everything in my life right now there is something missing that I cannot fill in. I’m working two jobs. I’m living with my family on prioritizing my health and exercise and I have close friendships and companionship. But I feel like there’s something missing where I don’t feel emotionally regulated, and it all leads back to this need to be touched. So I’m asking for some advice to help manage that need instead of chasing after toxic relationships or feeling that I can feel the void by being married or something. It’s all just misguided and I need some help or maybe I just need a hug. ";;;;
2025-10-09 20:10:49;I think I might be neurodivergent (Autism/ADHD?), but I’m not sure. Can someone help me make sense of this?;"I’m a high school student and I find it increasingly hard each day to even go to school. It’s such a loud, overstimulating place that always leaves me drained with as I arrive home. 

I find it so much easier to focus on my studies when I’m at home rather than at school because I can’t focus in such a noisy place. Everything feels so fast-paced and I feel like the slowest one, and everybody seems like they’re used to it. 

I feel like no one in school truly gets me. I do have a group of friends that I’m quite close with, but it seems as if none of them truly gets me either. It’s like our general vibe and personality is mismatched. 

Honestly, I don’t only feel this way with school friends but also family members. I’m often labelled too sensitive or too honest for people, and I can’t help but hate myself for it. But also, I find it jarring that people can tell a lie/fake something without hesitation. I’ve been coping and lately it feels too much. 

Ever since I was little, I feel like the odd one out in school. I had little shame even when being tardy, until my parents laughed at me because I didn’t find it embarrassing to be asked to run a lap in the school yard for being late. 

I had a best friend when I was little and a little drama went on one day when I saw her crying in the playground alone. When I asked her why she was crying she told me it was because of our classmate A. So immediately I asked A with full honesty if she made my best friend cry, and no I didn’t have malicious intent, I was just curious as to why she made my best friend cry, I wanted to know what happened.

I don’t know why, but that was my instinct as a child. Maybe I didn’t get social schemes and shouldn’t have told A directly, maybe normal kids would know as to not to tell A directly. But then things went awry and A started getting mad at me because she denied what she probably thinks as accusation from me. 

Then my best friend emerged from the playground to the classroom, still teary-eyed, and A asked her one thing: did I make you cry? And her answer was: No, she made me cry! (As she points to me). I didn’t understand why she did that, but as I grow up I finally understand that it’s probably the normal thing to do to not tell a friend that they made someone cry as it can be seen as accusation. 

There was also one time when I was a kid where I was in a new environment. I think I was introduced to English lessons as an extracurricular class (English is not my first language lol), and I remember not laughing for a month until I just couldn’t hold my laughter because the joke they made was really funny. (honestly even till this point I don’t know why so), I was around 6 or 7. I keep recalling that memory now and keep wondering why I did that. 
 
And so I’ve come to a possibility that I might be neurodivergent. (I have no diagnosis yet). These are just a few slices of my experience I couldn’t understand, but I actually have many many more! I asked my psychologist if she could assist me in finding out whether I’m neurodivergent (Autism, ADHD, etc), but she said it might stem from trauma, and she hasn’t been replying to my follow-up questions. 

I also had weird traits since I was little: pencil biting, nail biting, nail picking, scalp picking. As I moved school around grade 4, I realized I had to hide my weird traits. I just notice the way other people look at me with disgust, and I can’t help hide my true self, until now. I never have been able to express what I’m like, nor did I have anyone understanding me, not even my own family. 

I don’t know how to cope.

2025-10-09 18:35:26;Autism assessment;"Hi all! I don't know what to do and could use some perspective here...

My (27f) fiancé (35m) was diagnosed with ASD last week. It has absolutely shaken his world. He is suffering, especially socially. All the hard work he put into therapy over the years that never quite seemed to do the trick, all the childhood issues, it puts everything into perspective for him.

 Throughout this journey we found that I too experience a lot of symptoms, and fit into nearly all the criteria for autism. The only parts that make me question it all are the parts in the DSM-5 where it says it cannot be explained by anything else, and causes significant suffering. I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago, so I've already been through this ""this changes everything "" process before, and while I have little to no friends, I don't suffer the way I see so often online (or the way my fiancé does). 

I am at a loss. I strongly believe that since testing here is free and available, if I do have autism, I should get tested. However part of me is so freaked out by not meeting those two criteria that I'm wondering if it's even worth it to go, only to hear that because I don't ""suffer"" enough (aka, I learned how to live with it), I don't qualify. Or because I have ADHD (very clearly I do), it can't be ASD. 

Have any of you gone through something similar? Any advice or fresh ways to look at this?";;;;
2025-10-09 17:28:24;Is it a neurodivergent symptom to always feel a deep sense of shame?;"I am diagnosed with high functioning autism (Asperger’s), ocd, functioning depression, and anxiety disorder. 
I can’t help to feel this deep sense of shame whenever anyone sees my work or when it’s displayed. It’s like a mix of shame and embarrassment. I don’t feel accomplished or satisfaction with anything I do. This might sound like a over exaggeration I know but this is the harsh reality I’ve been avoiding. 
This feeling of shame is persistent with my social interactions. I don’t want to be a copy of people nor a sheep. And also big against conforming and it’s a big topic for me. Which leads me to be me most of the time but with that comes the sacrifice of this deep sense of shame. 
Is it normal? Do you also have that same experience?";;;;

Random side note I took a friends Ritalin once and it made me feel super focused in a one track way for hours with a lingering focus effect for the next day 😂 I didn’t like it though I prefer my default mind that’s not focused in a one track way but is all over the place ;;;;
2025-10-09 17:03:42;Quitting teaching job without another lined up after extreme burnout;"Hi y'all

So was recently diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. I'm planning on submitting my 30 day notice soon to a teaching job that's been eating my physical and mental health away. 

Teaching 4 classes 5 times a week, masking all the time, extreme chaos in the classrooms, being overworked and not even enough time to rest or even go to the bathroom or eat, and leave work to stress about work, summer breaks werent enough to recover. The extreme noise, the extreme bright lights, and chaos. It caused me so much real physical symptoms I'm surprised I'm still alive and still going at it for 7 years just telling myself you're weak and stupid, only to realise two months ago that I was AuDHD. 

Taken to the ER from work several times, got a brain MRI, brain CT scans, body aches, dry eye disease worsening, GI problems are so bad, migraines, hearing problems, and much more. 

And it's all due to extreme stress at work. I'm so surprised that ordinary people don't suffer this much and I kept comparing myself to them and trying to grind and not complain. Everyone thinks I'm so weak and lazy and doesn't want to work. 

Can't even imagine how to apply for another job while in this one. I can't recover at home let alone apply for jobs. I've become extremely antisocial and hate even going out because of this.

I have so much mixed feelings and doubt and self hatred for who I am, I just need some reassurance from the community that I'm not crazy.";;;;

They can still have the disorder, and it’s not like the symptoms stop and aren’t interfering with their lives. 

They have no choice, but to self diagnose themselves and look for solutions on how to solve their issues. It’s not always just for attention or a quirk it’s a genuine issue that they are trying to fix. They HAVE to stop it somehow.

2025-10-09 10:30:20;Recurring conflict involving ASD 1 friend. This NT would love advice.;"I am part of a very close friend group of 4 ladies. A couple years ago, one of us was diagnosed with ASD Level 1. Let's call my friend Jane. (Not her real name.) Honestly, it was very enlightening and helped us more directly support her emotionally and understand what's happening when we have conflicts. The other 3 of us, myself included, are (more or less) NT. Periodically there are times where the NT's get our feelings hurt by Jane's lack of emotional awareness. (More the other 2 than me. I have very thick skin, so I am often the mediator.) Sometimes she has meltdowns during social activities, which brings the activity to a grinding halt and is frustrating to everyone including Jane herself.

But we all love each other very much and all 4 of us work together to come up with strategies to help her emotionally regulate and talk about what we can do differently next time. This has helped our little found family get through a lot.

Like everyone, Jane has more trouble managing her emotions when she's stressed, and let's face it... this is a stressful time in the world right now. The same pattern has started to emerge several times and nothing seems to be working. I don't know what to about it.

We all share a passionate interest in board games. (Certainly a special interest for her.) We very frequently get together to play them. Jane has always taken playing the games very seriously. We usually play collaborative games (not competitive), so her hyperfocus manifests in her wanting to strategically think about all the moves and possibilities, expecting everyone else to know the rules (no matter how complex) backwards and forwards, etc.

We have been playing games together for a long time, but recently as all of our stress levels have gone up, Jane has meltdowns more and more frequently, nearly half the time we try to play these days. What happens is usually a variation of the following: Jane starts getting upset because she perceives that co-players aren't taking the game seriously enough and might cause the group to lose. She starts offering what she thinks is helpful advice, but presents in a way that comes across harsh to the NT's and makes them feel stupid. Feelings get hurt. The night ends ugly.

At this point the other 2 NT's in the group don't really want to play with her anymore. And it's hard for me to blame them. We have talked about it directly with Jane, but I don't think she really understands how exhausted with this pattern the other 2 NT's are. (I'm pretty tired of it too, I'm just usually not the one getting the criticisms so it's easier for me to weather.)

We all realize that telling Jane to ""chill out"" and ""it's just a game"" etc. is both insensitive and unrealistic. None of us want to her to sit there and not get into the details of the game, when that is what she enjoys.

But it also not fair to ask the NT's in the group to ""not take it personally"" or ""not be insecure"" when she says things that really do sound (to a NT) like attacks on their intelligence. (Even if Jane doesn't mean it that way.) Nor is it fair to ask them to play ""her way"" anymore than it is fair to ask Jane to play ""their way."" My other friends can't wish away their feelings anymore than Jane can.

None of us want the answer to be excluding Jane from our group interest of board games. I know the whole group would be willing to keep trying if we felt like we could make any progress. But nothing seems to change the pattern, and quite reasonably the other 2 ladies are starting to dread what's supposed to be a fun activity, because there's a good chance it will end in their feelings being hurt.

My guess as to why this has been such a tough nut for us to crack is that by definition, when the situation triggers, Jane is already experiencing some negative emotions (fun activity has stopped being fun). I think this makes it harder for her to stop and think about her phrasing before she lets loose with the first words on her mind. (Just my guess.)

The NT's have stated the following boundaries repeatedly, but Jane keeps unwittingly crossing them:  
1- Do not offer criticism unless you precede it with a compliment or affirmation of our friendship. After giving criticism, ask how the other person is feeling.\*\*  
2- Jane is allowed to take as long as she wants to plan her next move; we will not rush her or complain. Other players are allowed to base their moves on what they think is fun or interesting, even if it's not the best ""strategic"" choice.

(\*\*The above criticism strategy wasn't imposed one-sided on Jane. We all discussed at length as a group what rules we could set for ourselves on giving criticism that everyone would be okay with. We all 4 agreed this was a good norm for us. And Jane usually doesn't have trouble with it outside this board game context.)

Do you have advice for things we can try as a group to keep all having fun together?

*This is my first time posting in a ND community. If I phrased anything in a way that's insulting I apologize. It was not my intent. Please feel free to correct me, but please know it was by accident. Thank you!*

2025-10-09 10:23:32;Do you guys think self diagnosis is overhated?;People are so unempathetic towards people that self diagnose, what if they actually have it? Like I don’t agree with self diagnosing either, but they are still unempathetic ;;;;
2025-10-09 09:08:57;Morality (non diagnosed, suspected);"I’ve been feeling very heavy lately. I feel as if the conflict I experience, and the conflict everyone experiences can simply be solved by having the right set of rules. 

I don’t just mean everyone needs to agree on everything, I mean, I believe there is some posture I can take, that won’t make everyone happy, but it will keep me from causing harm. 

This has literally been a life long obsession for me. I became very interested in philosophy early on, in college I started studying world religions and ethics on my own time, or whenever I’d have an elective that allowed for it. 

At this point I’ve called myself a Christian (several different denominations), a Buddhist, a Daoist, and most recently a secular humanist. 

I feel as if certain rules are collectively spoken by society, and rarely followed or actually deconstructed. 

I pretty automatically separate what’s bad for me, vs what I find offensive, based on how it lines up with my overall sense of justice, and expect most people to do the same. Something can cause me harm without it being bad, some things that cause me discomfort are good or at least necessary. 

So when people accuse me of “being bad” or, in someway upsetting some kind of moral system, I believe it’s best to assume good nature and take it as a genuine invitation to reevaluate my own values, so that I can avoid causing harm in the future. 

I however find it deeply upsetting when I receive some kind of moral judgement, and after looking cannot find some kind of issue with my system. It’s like if someone told you you had your fly down and once you check it’s up.

Now I know, not everyone is good natured, but I don’t think I’m the perfect arbiter of that, and refusing to take criticism, well that’s worse than chasing every red herring that crosses your path. 

I’m just tired, I’m tired of what feels like a double bind, I either defend my values, then I’m proud and legalistic, or I chase every lead until I’m torn apart. I’m growing complacent. I’m tempted to settle in an echo chamber that affirms my right and my wrong, but that goes against all my ideals.

Im tired, confused, and frustrated ";;;;
2025-10-09 06:47:55;Ways autism is a good thing;"Hopefully others can join in here im fairly newly diagnosed so kinda still unsure what is autism vs just me 

Im a very attentive listener I dont actually pay that much attention which is definitely worsening but I give the appearance and most the time people just need a sound board anyways. 

Once I learned to just use my awkwardness to laugh at. Sure in a sense im being made fun of but im also controlling it. As opposed to trying to fit in and not. Someone tells me some tik tok gibberish and I just ask whats funny about 67 (ive figured this one out. I typically do fairly quick but its still kinda just dumb imo) 

Ill try to think of more generally positive posts. Idk i sorta suck out a diagnosis due to not doing the greatest but nonetheless I dont like logging on and seeing nothing but ""this sucks I hate being autistic"" I dont think autism is the problem for most of us I think managing it is. ";;;;
2025-10-09 06:28:41;Sexual fetishes and other proclivities;"Okay, so this is not meant to be weird or perverse in any way, shape, or form. So allow me to provide a little background about myself first.

I am a 43 years old gay man. I Received my original ASD diagnosis around the age of 10.  For as long as I can remember, I have had the most intense foot fetish for men’s bare feet, as well as my own. Allow me to explain even further… a huge part of my fetish is the exhibitionist factor. In other words, I love going barefoot in public, getting my feet dirty, and showing them off.  The main reason why I love doing this so much is because I know that it’s something polite society considers to be gross and socially taboo. Breaking these social norms by enjoying something so conventionally disgusting gives me a huge thrill.  I honestly don’t even like having sex.  If I could just enjoy another guy’s dirty bare feet while he enjoyed mine, I’d be totally happy.

And please don’t respond to this with a bunch of thoughtless crap about how “eww… feet are gross,” or whatever.  Because I know half of you who are tempted to respond in such a way are probably jerking off to anime characters and cartoon animals in your rooms anyway.  Which is totally fine! This is a judgement free zone! Do you if that’s your thing. But I’m trying to be serious and do some research here.

Okay, so that being said, I read a scientific study recently on the intense rate that sexual fetishes and proclivities occur in those of us with ASD, foot fetishes being one of a few. Others include public exhibitionism, rubbing genitals on other people and things, BDSM, and an overall infatuation with inanimate objects.

So I am curious… does anyone else here have a sex life that reflects this study? Again, no judgement here. Spill your guts if you feel comfortable doing so, and let’s have an honest conversation.";;;;
2025-10-09 05:29:21;Learning a second language;"So Ive always been on and off trying to learn a second language, in high school I did German and felt quite confident in it but it faded over time. 

Now I'd like to go back to it but, after being late diagnosed, its made me realise some things and now im not sure how to proceed with learning...

Its crossed my mind a few times, but if I was fluent or conversationally competent with a second language, youd never know either way based on conversation, because I struggle to keep up with dialogue in English, know where to respond etc, so in another language it would be the same (aka pretty bad) or worse. 

The point above i have to be okay with, and thats absolutely fine, cause its me. But I know a huge part of learning a language is speaking it, and im not sure if I just need to change my thinking on this or if there's a way to work around...

Also, for the same reason, I hate classes, being picked on and having pressure to just know things etc in a classroom. 
I like the structured learning but not the pressure... im not sure what ways of learning would be best for me given this. 

I have tried classes after leaving school and ended in becoming really overwhelmed and having to leave and have a meltdown...

If youve got any advice on this, or if anyone has a similar experience, id love to hear it.

2025-10-09 04:39:49;I feel like a fraud;"So in Denmark we have this popular type of institution called “efterskole” (afterschool). Its basically a type of boarding school for 15-16 year old, athletes and slackers alike. Efterskole requires everyone to be ultra social and get to know every 100-200 pupils that you will typically encounter at a standard efterskole, but i decided to go to the absolute biggest one with about 800 pupils, because of the facillities and equipment they own. (you pick a “line” or a theme for efterskole such as football, sailing, golf, cooking, media, animation, theatre, music, dance, etc). The point is i meet SO many people every day and i have a lot of very different friends, and i feel i always need to adjust my personality and behavior depending on the person and body language they express, and it makes me feel like the biggest fraud, additionally i tend to interpret others actions as harmful and condescending, so i get surprised every time people want to invite me to parties or spend time with me, but i still worry about when they will realize how shallow i am.
I really cant shake the feeling and i have always been horrible at controlling my emotions. My parents never suspected i was autistic, they thought i had bipolar disorder and so did my doctor until a few months ago when i got diagnosed with aspergers.";;;;
2025-10-09 03:49:00;Curiosity post-did others with the ‘tism notice yours?;"Hello, F adult with autism here. 

I wasn’t diagnosed until my 30s, but a few people I befriended with autism recognised it in me prior to my diagnosis. 

Have others had a similar experience? Feel free to share your story. 

To kick it off, having autism never occurred to me and I shirked it off when friends with autism recognised traits in me - whatever they may have been - as I didn’t know much about autism and had yet to be diagnosed, but I don’t believe it’s deeply impeded me. Moreso, I am hyper aware of social situations where I’ve essentially over time tried to, ‘copy+paste’, if that makes sense? I have trouble reading people and tend to take things quite literally at times. 

My mother still rejects it (my little quirk) despite diagnosis but I attribute this to her work within the courts for individuals with autism who are not living independently (so, I perceive her view of autism is limited). 

To end this post, I’ll quote a friend from drama school, “embrace the quirk”. ";;;;

My homework is 6 questions worth 25 points. I don't have 1-2 hours free time in a chunk. I feel I need to do these questions. I started to catastrophes that I'm going to fail.

2025-10-09 03:00:21;Late diagnosed, now feel like I'm plateauing.;"

Hi all,

Got diagnosed at 40 yo last April. Very happy because things finally fell into place. Then the meds came which we're a game changer, mainly in the beginning. After that it felt like , well you have your diagnoses and your meds, good luck.

Then the anger, the grief and the sadness came. What could have been if my parents actually paid attention and noticed me more. What if, what if etc.

 I do see it also at a new begining (made the chose to continue getting my teachers degree) but it often feels so heavy and it makes me so tired.

The mental healthcare system in the Netherlands feels very limited when it comes to ADHD and relies a lot on CBT which doesn't do a lot for me.

How are you dealing with it? First time reaching out about this so apologies if I'm a bit rambly.

Cheers.

But, they don’t believe I’m autistic (I’m self-diagnosed, many long years of extensive self reflection and research, I considered official diagnosis but the expense and also downsides of being diagnosed were not worth it), and even if they did they wouldn’t really grasp how it affects me even if I told them directly.  They just think I’m being dramatic or lazy or something (which has of course fed into my feelings of guilt and shame over being burnt out) and I’m always on edge when I’m not being “productive” enough.  I don’t know how it’s possible for me to recover in this environment.

Posting again in hopes of more replies, I really need help/advice.  I’ve been struggling for so long and I’m so, so tired.";;;;
2025-10-09 01:28:59;I have autistic traits but how do I know if I'm on the spectrum?;"Hi, I've been thinking about this for some time and wanted to share online to get more opinions on this matter. 

I'm 22F and I've been suspecting I might be on the spectrum but don't want to assume anything because I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I tried to compile a document of all the experiences I've had that list my symptoms, but I'm worried it doesn't mean anything since it may just be my anxiety or depression rather than autism. I talked about it with my therapist and was asked to point out the one thing that makes me think I have it, which turned into refuting every point I made on my PDF file rather than having a conversation about the possibility so I deleted it.

I've taken the tests on embrace autism,  (RAADS-R, CAT-Q, The Aspie Quiz, and AQ) but later found out that they give high false positive results for people who have anxiety and depression. And I've read the DSM-5 criteria and I can think of multiple different experiences throughout my childhood and adult life that line up with the criteria.

I started to read other autistic people's experiences online and it feels like it's a copy and paste of my whole life. I have tried to find and read NHS studies on autism but couldn't find any in relation to depression and anxiety that are helpful. I do have a hypersensitivity issue and have problems talking with people in social situations but I'm wondering if it's more anxiety rather than autism.

I'm wondering if I should go for an official assessment or not but I'm on the fence because of how expensive it is. I’m really confused on what to do and don't want to seem like I'm over exaggerating.

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind and insightful commentary. I'm going to do more research and probably stay away from getting a professional assessment for now. I've been trying at home accommodations other autistic people  online recommend to deal with daily life which has been helping.

2025-10-09 01:00:43;Grad student promoting work;"I sent the mods a message about this a while ago, but haven't heard back.

Hi. I'm a non-traditional grad student studying educational technologies. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1993, and still struggle with it more than I'd like, even with decent meds. My entire immediate family is neurodiverse.

My full time job is working as an employment specialist at an independent living center, where we help any people with any sort of disability.

I've developed an Android app that's geared towards helping ND folk with job interviews. It comes with a companion online course about interviewing when you're ND. There's a Quick Start guide for the app, and there's a custom chat bot that you'd have access to.

All of this is at no cost and I'm not asking for anything. The reason why I'm not posting links here just yet is because everything is hosted on my site and this all could be considered self promotion. So, just wanted to get a feel for the subreddit, make sure I wasn't pissing anyone off.

You can tell by my post history that I usually use Reddit for video game chats, but I post on other subs from time to time.

Thanks, have a good rest of the week.";;;;
2025-10-08 22:14:48;Anyone else a bus driver?;"I received my ASD diagnosis about 7 months ago. Along with a couple other things. I left my job in June and I'm now on to my 3rd career, this time as a bus driver. I've always worked full time, and with each job I make it about 3 years, get extremely burnt out, and then leave to another job. Driving city buses is going to be very different than my previous jobs, and (hopefully) less stressful and less pressure in many ways. I would like this to be a long term career for me as switching jobs every few years in itself is exhausting. 

Does anyone else work in transit? Do you find you're able to make accommodations for yourself as needed? What are some habits you have found that help you manage to the day to day of the job? 

Fun story... I'm transgender so I've been joking (outside of work bc I have to be stealth there) that I'm putting the ""trans"" back in ""transit"" 😂";;;;

When I was younger, I used to smoke cigarettes sometimes, but I never felt the high or calming or whatever it is that smokers say they get.

2025-10-08 13:03:56;Why is severe autism so disabling in particular?;"People with severe autism have it very bad. They usually can’t even feed themselves, dress themselves, bathing, or can’t talk as a grown adult, and it’s pretty obvious that they have it extremely hard. They have extreme emotional outbursts and cannot help it. 

I’m not trying to invalidate other disorders, but autism seems to be extremely bad in particular whenever it’s severe, a lot of other severe disorders don’t seem to be on the same level. My mom has moderate-severe diagnosed ADHD, and she has a high paying job and lives a mostly normal life. 

I know not all ADHD’ers are that good in functioning in life, but severe ADHD or dyslexia usually isn’t as impairing as autism whenever it’s severe, even though it can still be very impairing.

2025-10-08 09:56:09;Another Shot in the Dark - Canadian Seeks Late Diagnosis (Autism);"Hi everyone - I made a post a few weeks ago, but I think I failed to be specific enough... my bad. (link to original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1nn491v/canadian_seeking_doctor_for_late_autismadhd/))

Anyways... take two! I'm female, late 30's, live in Canada, and still undiagnosed. I'm hoping to find a ***Psychologist or Psychiatrist anywhere in Canada that specializes in late diagnosing women FOR AUTISM***. If this doctor happens to have a trauma informed lens, that would be incredible, but more of a bonus at this point.

Someone had suggested Layla care - and I reached out to them. I can confirm they were very professional, *but they don't cover autism assessments - just ADHD.*

While ADHD is likely an issue for me, the one that I think is causing more issues for me (especially at work), is autism, so I am choosing to focus on that at this time.

So if anyone has any suggestion that meets the above criteria, I would be incredibly grateful to hear it. It's been a long road in trying to get a diagnosis, and I'm trying not to lose faith. Thanks everyone.";;;;
2025-10-08 06:16:32;Is Miscommunication like this autism or just me being off?;"Throughout the day, I speak with family and I am told one thing and they change verbiage on me. Maybe I'm too focused on specific language used during earlier conversations.. but I'm told because of my potential misunderstanding that it's a sign I'm autistic (not saying I'm not, I've been told by others I likely am, but I've not been diagnosed). 

For example, communication like this is what gets me:

""I'm buying a pair of sweat pants and sweat shirt""

Later, when i see a charge on my card about it, they say, ""ya, it's from the sweat suit I purchased earlier"" to which I get confused because I've not heard ""sweat suit"" and it's not *immediately clear to me* that suit is referring to the combination of the items. When I ask about it to clarify, they chide me for not immediately knowing that suit is a combination of things, which I can get, but earlier when it was described to me, that's not how it was phrased so my brain didn't immediately combine the two in my head later. Is it really that crazy that I wouldn't then immediately attribute ""suit"" to be the same items that were described separately and individually earlier? Is this really potential autism or am I just dumb and not fully understanding language as I should in some cases?";;;;
2025-10-08 06:00:53;Bullying in school shaped and molded me... almost too much.;"I was bullied constantly. Verbally and physically. Spit on, punched, kicked, people jumping on my back trying to take the 'big guy' down, always picked last in gym class, made fun of constantly. All kinds of shit.

I stopped growing when I was 11 and I was 6'3 and about 130 pounds. Along with it I was extremely quiet. I had to move states every few years because of my dad's job changes. From kindergarten to 5th grade I lived in 4 different states.

I wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago at 36, but any hope of having a somewhat normal social life went out the window with moving that much. I didn't know how to talk or approach people so I just stayed mute. Many in my class thought that I didn't speak English. 

The bullying was constant. I just wanted to sit and read my books but they wouldn't let me. They'd rip the books out of my hands. They'd make snide comments. Wave their hands in between me and my book. 

After years of it I got fed-up and obsessed over bodybuilding. I gained over 100 pounds and in 11th and 12th grade I was 6'3 245 pounds of mostly muscle. There was a good amount of fat in there too as I just wanted to be big. I worked out for 3 or 4 hours a day, every day. I ate 5-6 cans of tuna a day right out of the can and I drank half a gallon of whole chocolate milk each day.

People finally began to leave me alone. 

Most of the people who did this bullying were all jocks. To this day I despise sports and all who play them. I know I shouldn't but it is so hard not to think back to those days. The worst of it was when I got big all these assholes wanted me to play their football with them.

One time they were doing dumb bell presses in weights class. I went up to the bench next to them, grabbed the 120s, and repped them. Felt great. They were doing 60s. I silently racked them back and left.

Sometimes the size didn't even stop them from trying to bully me. I remember going to extremes to get them to leave me alone. I trained my knuckles against punching bags, then makiwara war boards, then cement. I'd toughen them up enough where I could do some solid punches into the brick/cement walls. I'd then do this as a 'trick' to scare people.

My friend, who was also ASD, was big as well. He was 6'2 270 pounds, but mostly out of shape. We did Judo together for years in high school too. It got to the point in 12th grade that the two of us would have the hallway part as we walked by. Felt good to finally not be mocked.

I realized now, over 20 years later, that I still have this facade. I still workout religiously and now sport a shaved head with a horseshoe mustache. I find it keeps people at a distance.";;;;
2025-10-08 05:17:06;A diagnosis can’t be so quickly and simple… can it? I’m confused;"I have been told all my life I might have autism and ADHD but I come from immigrant family and didn’t have health insurance until 3 years ago. I had an appointment with a psychiatrist today because I just wanted to get a better understanding of who I am and resources/tactics that can help me. It was an hour appointment and we were just talking. They were asking me a lot of questions on habits, my life, behavioral and etc. We actually were running out of time because there was a lot of stuff being said but at the end he told me my “evaluation results are very clear” and I have a strong case of autism, adhd, and anxiety(a symptom of my autism).

That’s not an official diagnosis right? There’s no way they can diagnose me with all that in my first meeting, right? From my understanding, there should be tests and assessments for that kind of stuff… I’m confused as to how he was able to make those statements so quickly it caught me off guard… Evaluations aren’t the same and I’m not officially diagnosed right? Did anyone else have a similar experience as me?";;;;
2025-10-08 03:48:48;Do you think we are at a stage in society where  we no longer need labelled representation of ND for people to accept it?;"I was watching Lidwig (BBC Crime Drama) with my mum a couple of nights ago. Right from the first episode, we kept (kindly) joking that all the mannerisms David Mitchel portrays were just like one of my mums friends. We knew it was obvious that the character being portrayed had Autism, just as we know her friend has (undiagnosed) Autism.

I have diagnosed ADHD and undiagnosed Autism and my mum has undiagnosed Autism with ADHD traits but she is aware and recognises some of her symptoms. I am a huge advocate for Neurodiversity visibility, I was the EDI Champion at my last workplace which I loved. My mums attitude toward most things throughout my life were ‘turn the other cheek’, ‘walk away’, ‘ignore’, ‘don’t react/stay quiet’ so this is how I grew up, but a long time ago I chose not to be like this after being endlessly bullied at school and walked all over throughout my life. It took years to get the courage to start standing up for myself (still minimal) but as many of us know, it’s much easier to stand up and advocate for others than ourselves (helped by our strong sense of justice? And usually knowing what it’s like to be bullied).

Anyway.

Watching Ludwig and listening to our conversation about recognising traits in a friend, I said I’d wished the creators of Ludwig would subtly slip in a couple of times that he has Autism/Autistic traits. I wanted them to quietly label it. Not focus on it at all as that isn’t the point of the show.

My reasoning was that I was undiagnosed until I was 25. I knew since the age of 10 that I was different from other people but I didn’t know why. I spent 15 years talking to people about my struggles, doing my own research, going to counselling, etc to work out what was going on with me and why I struggled so much more than other people. I was in the dark. I didn’t understand. 

My mum disagreed with my suggestion it should be mentioned lightly in the show (at least once) and said that simply normalising this personality type is important. It should just be considered another personality type. There is no need for the label in the show. People shouldn’t have to label themselves or others to be accepted.

As much as I do agree and see what she’s saying, our society has not reached this point yet. We are still at the stage where neurodiversity needs to be labelled so people can learn about the traits and accept them as part of the label before we can just treat them as another ‘personality’ type. We need to recognise the differences and accept that many neurodivergent people need support to gain equity with neurotypicals before we can just create a space where everyone is supported for their own needs regardless of label. (Please correct me if this comparison is offensive but it was the only one I could think of at the time) I said that it’s like recognising ‘non-traditional’ types of sexuality. Society has needed labels to understand the different types (and for many other reasons of course) before we can just accept it and call it ‘love’. Despite how evolved we think we are, generally (but not always), and history has proven that, humans need to understand something to be able to truly accept it. Once everyone has gained a level of understanding of neurodiversity, it will become widely accepted and normalised.

I looked at both of us recognising the traits and imagined other people watching the show. Other people that were doing the same thing as us, maybe thinking of themselves or maybe thinking about a friend or family member. Other people who don’t have diagnoses or actual awareness of neurodivergent traits yet. I thought back to when I spent years feeling totally alone, not really able to resonate my struggles with anything/anyone around me. Occasionally seeing people on TV/movies with the same struggles as me but there not being a label for me to identify what it was. Perhaps because back then the creators didn’t know what they were portraying either. There was representation (usually the subject being bullied rather than being accepted) but no label for others to define and recognise it. Without those labels, people who resonate are not able to go and more easily seek help for themselves, and those who recognise these traits in others are not able to silently understand someone they know with those traits better. This isn’t about everyone going around and telling others that they are neurodivergent, this is about putting a name to the ‘odd’ things that some people do, giving it a reason, and allowing people to go ‘oh that’s why they do it, okay, cool.”

We know that neurodiversity is a whole mishmash of traits and symptoms. How do you go to the doctors and list every weird thing you do/feel? You can’t just say “overhead fluorescent light makes me angry, everyone thinks everything I say is in a rude tone, I flap my arms when I’m upset, I zone out every other line I read, I can’t eat anything that’s red in colour” and so on and expect them to give you a diagnosis. All of these traits/symptoms seem wildly detached from each other. I would always go to the doctors and name a bunch of stuff I was struggling with every time, but my neurodiversity was never recognised by a medical professional. It took me as an adult talking in depth to my aunt about my struggles for her to suggest it to me.

Since COVID, some conditions such as ADHD and Autism have become much more understood in society, but we still have such a long way to go.

What I’d like to know is your opinion. I see both sides but as someone who has been involved with raising awareness and advocacy work, I see how many people still don’t have a clue and how much work there is still to be done. I have a personal journey to draw from and I never want anyone else to suffer as long as I had to. 

You don’t know what you don’t know. Representation matters. Labelling has a purpose. ";;;;
2025-10-08 03:44:30;Constant boredom and no motivation;"Hey,
I’m pretty new to all this. I was only recently diagnosed with autism, and I’m still trying to understand what’s “me” and what’s the autism part.

One thing I’ve noticed for as long as I can remember is this constant feeling of boredom. I want to do things that are fun or interesting, but when I think of options, everything just feels kind of meaningless or like it wouldn’t be worth it. Then I end up doing nothing and feeling guilty for wasting time.

I’m wondering if this is something others experience too? Maybe it’s an executive dysfunction thing, or maybe just burnout?

Also, I keep reading about “special interests,” but I honestly don’t even know when something counts as one. How do you tell the difference between a special interest and just a regular hobby or phase?

Would really appreciate hearing how others deal with this.";;;;
2025-10-08 03:38:44;"""You don't look autistic""";"Hi, I'll quickly preface the post by saying that I'm someone on the spectrum with low needs. I've learned to mask and read social cues early. I'm partly self-diagnosed since I live in a rather small town and it's impossible to get an official confirmation unless you are a child or have higher needs (my assessment was its own can of worms: I was literally told I don't look autistic in spite of fulfilling all the criteria. I do have a confirmation from my college though).

So, recently we've gotten a new colleague that is also on the spectrum. We work in service. They seem nice but clearly struggle much more than me or at least show it more. No jab at them obviously, however this addition to the team has filled me with certain uncomfortable emotions. We certainly have incomparable traits and while I sympathise with them, I also feel annoyance (which is just projecting and internalised ableism) and, to a certain extent, doubt in myself.

I know that no single autistic person is the same and our needs are different but it got me thinking how people around and even doctors fail to register me as someone autistic. The latter are surprised when I bring it up and often reply with ""wow, I couldn't tell!"". Add to that the fact that my family is still majorly in denial about my 'character trait', as they put it. Because of all those factors I can't help but feel like an imposter recently.

How do you guys manage that feeling? Do you also get self-aware about traits you show and think you are trying hard to imitate someone ""autistic""? If you also mask a lot, do you feel like you are losing the grip on the autistic part of yourself? Like, you've cured yourself of it or something.

I would be very thankful for your input, thoughts and opinions!";;;;
2025-10-07 23:18:42;The Healing Process;"I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD at the start of this year.  Generalised anxiety disorder was also included in the diagnosis.  The meds for both have been beneficial but what I have realised is the 6 decades of undiagnosed ADHD possibly require more attention than the ADHD itself.  

This has put me on the path of healing, not from ADHD but the damage done by having undiagnosed ADHD for so long.  I have realised the biggest issue I have had with was needing to use anxiety constantly to attempt to function like a normal human being.  This led to many periods of burn out and I suspect some damage to my nervous system. 

My focus now is on healing the damage that has been done. I have learnt yoga and meditation practises in the past that are useful aids, but the primary tool will be rest and avoidance of all stress.  I will be giving this the all time it needs.

Have others viewed their diagnosis in this way? And what did you do to help yourself heal?";;;;

### Details

I'm 38 and AFAB and have always been ""weird"" in some form or another. I can tell you details, but I don't want this to seem like I'm seeking a diagnosis *here* and am also curious about the answer to this for a general asker and not just myself and my situation!

Essentially my traits (not sure if I feel right calling them symptoms) are a mishmash of traits are ones that are associated with anxiety, being on the autism spectrum, and/or ADHD. I have diagnoses for anxiety and ADHD and have medication for both, but only got those diagnoses and meds in the past ~4 years, was raw-dogging life before that. 

As I become more aware of traits associated with some manifestations of autism, I often wonder if the things I experience relating to anxiety, ADHD, or both are perhaps just a mix of autism traits and coping skills/masking I've developed over my life that seem like something else.

My experience with being diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety has given me the impression that there's some bias toward positive diagnosis. By that I mean that any time I've gone to a physician or psychiatrist saying ""I have these traits, I was wondering if it might be ______"" lo and behold, I was right and they diagnosed me with whatever I suspected after asking some follow-up questions. I have never been ""screened out"" of something I thought I might have, or redirected to something else that might explain a trait or symptom.

And so I am left in a state where I don't even know if I really have anxiety, really have ADHD, and/or something else is at play like being autistic* that may be coinciding with ADHD or anxiety or may be mistaken for them or something else entirely!

So, all of this is to say, I am ready, willing, and able to pursue the most accurate, true possible diagnosis I can. I want to know with as much certainty as possible what I do and do not have. I understand this could be a long-term process working with one or multiple providers over time, and I'm okay with that. I just want to know how to be sure I am seeing the right provider(s) who is/are able to actually ""get to the bottom of this"" and not just say ""Yep, seems right"" to things that may be something else. Complicating the issue, many assessments seem to be specifically for children. Does anyone have any guidance on getting gold standard neurodiversity assessments for adults? (I'm in the US, I have insurance, and I can pay out of pocket for things insurance doesn't cover.)";;;;
2025-10-07 21:36:09;I don’t know how to educate my children.;"I live in a third-world country, and high-functioning autism isn’t even recognized here.

I’ve suspected that I’m autistic for years. I tried to get a diagnosis, but it didn’t work—it’s very stereotypical here.

My childhood was really hard. In my country, a woman’s social abilities are everything. People would say, *“Stop being so closed off; a woman should always be social and welcoming.”* For a long time, and even now, I have to mask, even with my family. If I don’t, I get criticized or even yelled at for isolating too much.

Even though it was hard, I think masking is what helped me survive. It taught me how to navigate the world, and now I have a great remote job where I don’t have to mask anymore after years of in-person work. I live with a partner I can be honest with. I don’t think I could live this way now if I hadn’t gone through that.

My story is very specific to where I live. There’s almost no understanding of autism here, and it feels like the only way to survive is to build your own world. To do that, I think sometimes you have to blend in for a while.

I really want to give the best to my child. I don’t want them to go through what I did. But at the same time, I feel like I have to be realistic about the world we live in. I worry that over-accommodating or over-protecting them might do more harm than good. What do you think?";;;;

2025-10-07 06:40:36;Is it worth looking into whether or not I have autism as someone with diagnosed ADHD?;"Hello, I (19m) have been recently wondering whether or not there is the potential that I may or may not be autistic. I am already diagnosed with some bad inattentive ADHD that I've struggled with a lot in my life and recently found out that around 20-50% of people with ADHD also have autism so I got curious and did some digging. The more I looked into it, the more I seemed to relate to autism and it explained some things that ADHD didn't.

At first glance I don't seem autistic in many ways but I on a deeper behavioral level, I definitely have some habits or things that might say otherwise. I grew up as the ""weird"" or ""quiet"" kid but thats another story. To avoid typing paragraphs of information I'll just go ahead and provide some quick points that raised some flags for me.

* I'm not the most socially adept or inclined person
* I struggle to maintain eye contact in most conversations
* I'm not interested in any social norms aside from when I have to mask to fit in
   * growing up I was never really up to date with trends or what all the other kids were doing. I didn't exactly understand it all
   * I also sometimes take things too literally and can't really respond correctly when the other person is joking
* With communication I am often soft spoken and can sometimes have trouble with speaking too quietly or with subtle monotone/sounding disinterested when I speak
   * this is also weird because I had to go to speech therapy as a little kid because I would talk so fast nobody could understand me (or so I'm told by my parents. I don't remember it at all)
* Pretty bad rbf unless someone gets me talking
* I can occasionally be literal or blunt in the way I speak to people and it could possibly come off as rude or impolite though I don't mean to be
* I am hypersensitive to some loud sounds and it will physically stress me out including receptive noises that I dislike which will also do the same
* I struggle to be flexible with new plans when I've already planned out my day. Especially when it's sudden plans and I need to adapt immediately. This also stresses me out a lot
* I have a pretty strong sense of justice when it comes to fairness and mistreatment
* Executive dysfunction is my worst enemy

  
Those were \*some\* of the things that I found in myself. Some of them could probably be brushed off as effects from ADHD but I wanted to get second opinions. I think it's important to add that I also don't do the signs of autism like hand stimming, rocking, etc. I can't exactly come to my family about this cause they wouldn't take me seriously aside from my older sister who we think has undiagnosed autism. When I told her this stuff, she said she related a lot so it got me wondering. What do you think, is it worth looking further into or is it possibly just ADHD or some other things?";;;;
2025-10-07 06:23:44;Special interests;"I feel like I have special interests but my diagnosed autistic friend doesn't.

I have also always liked the Amish, medical equipment and stuff, childbirth, and other animals too. I feel like these aren't typical interests ya know. I like researching these things. The only sports I care about involve animals, I crave medical attention and I love to use medical equipment, I know a lot about the disability communities and am involved in that, I literally wanted to become Amish/Mennonite, not in elementary school, literally in high school! I guess it's not just ""weird"" interests that qualify as ""special"" but I know it's the obsessiveness. But I guess I just feel invalidated that I'm not smart enough with these things or that I don't put in enough effort to research them. She thinks I'm hurting myself by putting myself in that box.

2025-10-07 06:13:16;Help with constant Job Boredom;"Hey all, not sure if this is universal or not. But I'm in my late 20's and just recently got diagnosed level 1 and my entire life have been suffering from an issue everyone is flabbergasted over: I keep leaving my jobs, constantly. pre-finishing my B.S in CS I had 26 total jobs by 23. After doing 4 and a half in the military and graduating with my degree I currently have 2 years at a company, 9 months at a different company, and now coming up on one week to a year on my current position. So that's 3 different companies in 4 ish years post graduation. I just keep getting bored of my positions. To clarify I have a decent Software engineering position. But I just keep finding projects.. Boring? Like I get excited to start and hit the do-over button but it always ends the same. With me being bored of projects after 6 months. Then slogging through until I want to leave. I just learn all I feel that there is to learn and get bored and want to move on. And I can't barely bring myself to work on what's needed so I just have to quit. I can't tell if its the projects that actually bore me or the dark boxes you get forced into coding in. I have recently found myself doing it again and I was even thinking about just quitting my career all together to start a coffee shop, or be a police officer or join the FBI or something. Even an urge to move to a different state. At this point I am extremely lost and I keep doing this and I don't know if this is something wrong or right and I keep losing sleep over it. Is this normal for people like us? Or anyone who's been in a position like mine? I want to keep it professional and stay at least 2 years before leaving but I don't even know anymore how to dissect these thoughts. What do?

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.";;;;
2025-10-07 04:57:28;I’m Going to Be 24 Soon;I’m really unhappy about my intense social anxiety that hasn’t gone away since birth, despite practicing and making friends along the way. People still treat me like I’m a kid at times when I’m screwing up socially and being weird. I wasn’t officially diagnosed, so please don’t assume I’m self-diagnosed and believe I definitely have Asperger’s. I might be schizophrenic, who knows? 😂 I’m having a super difficult time with my concept of self (still normal at my age), but I wish people were more forgiving and understood I’m truly struggling to stay around people before I feel like screaming and crying and dissociating (I disassociate so much, thought I had derealization as a teen only to realize it’s probably the anxiety and Asperger’s). Do any of you relate to the extreme social anxiety? I don’t even feel anxiety symptoms, I’ll often just hold it in and act natural and most people never notice. I hate it. I hate being viewed as weird and stupid instead of autistic, and it it is autistic, I’m something else extreme to them. It’s like I can’t win. Do you all think it’s autism? I’ve been extremely shy and socially anxious for no reason (that’s been my main focus of struggle and pain since day 1 and no one in my family or friend circle could ever understand why it’s so severe). Please help. Love you all. This thread is full of good people, and I love reading a lot of your guys’ experiences because I feel I can relate to them too :);;;;
2025-10-07 04:31:10;UPDATE: Labels are useless and self diagnosis is valid. Change my mind.;"Hey y’all. I’ve read all your comments and I appreciate most of the feedback on my last post, and I’d like to share an elaboration/ evolution on my beliefs regarding labels and self diagnosis. I didn’t expect for it to be responded to as much as it did, kinda just expected to be downvoted into oblivion, but you guys really brought all the nuance and intellectual conversation that you don’t see much across Reddit. 
If you’d like to see the last post, it’s linked in the url. 

So the majority in the comments say that labels are necessary to provide resources like medications, certain types of therapies, accommodations at school and work, government assistance, and so on. I wholeheartedly agree. I myself benefit from being labeled. I get priority registration at university, extended test times, and am allowed to record lectures. I would likely be struggling a lot more in school if I didn’t have those support systems.

The majority of commenters are also against the idea of self diagnosis. I agree that in certain situations it’s inappropriate to do so. If for example you’re telling people you have OCD because you like things clean, it’s not only harmful to yourself because you’re putting yourself in a box that’s not meant for you, but to members of the OCD community, as it reinforces societal stigma and continues to push misinformed ideas of what OCD really is.

However, after reading your comments, I have also realized my story of coming to terms with my neurodivergence is much different from the majority. You guys were mostly respectful; there was only one comment that really got under my skin. 
They were discrediting my story, saying it’s unbelievable that I could have had so many different diagnoses and tried so many different medications. But is it really unbelievable? I have been in and out of mental hospitals since the age of 12. I have lost track of the amount of times I tried to KMS in my adolescence. Many of the medications I was taking, my parents and psychiatrists decided to stop, because I’d used them previously in a suicide attempt, and it could’ve been risky to keep me on the same meds. 
How is it unbelievable that I could be misdiagnosed with bipolar or borderline or depression and so on, when those all can present so similarly to autism or ocd?
Rejection sensitivity, impulsiveness, reclusion, rumination, pushing people away in relationships, paranoia, delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations. That could be describing many of those disorders I was diagnosed with. If all my diagnoses were on a Venn diagram, it would probably be a circle or very close to one.

My point in all this, is that those diagnoses were not beneficial in figuring out wtf is wrong with me, like they were for you guys. Every new diagnosis just made me more and more confused with myself and my needs. Which is why I believe in my case, coming to my own conclusions based on my already assigned diagnoses was the most beneficial for figuring myself out. 

Im okay with the autism and ocd label because it makes sense to me. I am 100% without a doubt autistic. It shows in the way my childhood went, it shows in the way I perceive the world now and how I interact with others, it shows in my genealogy reports , it shows in my relatives. OCD makes sense because I have lost probably tens of thousands of hours to ruminating, compulsions, and obsessions, and again, it runs in the family. OCD is also common amongst epileptic folks, and yes, I am diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy. I have seen neurologists, gotten cat scans, mris, eegs, the whole deal. I have a lesion or gap of some sort in my left temporal lobe that is visible in cat scans. And yes, I am taking medication for it. I think the reason why I’m able to be stable now, even despite being off all my psych meds, is because the medication I’m taking for my seizures (lamotrigine) also doubles as a mental health treatment.

I’d like to thank the majority of you for your contributions to my realizing that my previous statement was not accurate for every situation or person. Posting this was beneficial for me as I was able to address my own biases and hear from others who have had different experiences from my own. Thank you. ❤️❤️❤️

2025-10-07 04:19:37;Introduction;"I am 27 YO and was diagnosed in 2013.

At this time, I live at home with my family and work in a disability resource center. However, I want to get into a job that allows me to travel and advocate for disability civil rights be that on Capital Hill, in my state, or for a firm of some sort. I'm also a massive baseball fan and would love to work in sports, but it is more of a hobby than a job. I like my job a lot, but it has become somewhat repetitive with simply filing paperwork or meeting with clients to go through the same challenges when they don't make progress on their goals. These folks might have Asbergers but they have all kinds of disabilities  I try to be grateful for the blessings I have and I do feel as much, but still something is not right in my life. I find myself comparing to others and even nearly got into manosphere content which I’m glad I got out of since that stuff is not my style. 

Lately, i've been studying for the LSAT and applying for Law School so I can pursue this dream. I decided on Law school over Public Policy because I have dyscalculia and cannot do Math at all.

However, I find myself becoming depressed or reluctant towards LSAT studying a lot more lately and going down Youtube/Facebook rabbit holes. I have gone part time at my work to study for it from 8:30-5:30 to now 8:45-1:00PM and my family is helping me pay, which I am eternally grateful for! I have improved my score a great deal and have spent hours on this, but something does not feel right. I know what I want to do, but I fear it is more of a fantasy dream than a reality. And if I do go to law school, how am I to know if I can get a job that would meet my goals? How can I prioritize my mental health in such an environment? What should I look for in programs? The personal statement is completed but now I have to write my individual essays for schools.

I struggle a lot with networking and asking questions and get extremely nervous during informational interviews, of which I have done several. I'm really hard on myself about proper social skills and asking more open ended questions, but it is almost like I keep hitting my head on a wall.

Are there any folks among us who have become disability civil rights advocates in their job? If so, what was the path to your career and what were some challenges you faced? What about those of us who went to law school? How did you make it through? Or did you find an alternate road?";;;;
2025-10-07 04:19:25;How can I express my truth without taking up space that isn’t mine?;"Hello! 

I have BPD, CPTSD and am a HSP. 

I find myself relating to SO much of the neurodivergent experience as I have so many symptoms that overlap with y’all 

- sensory difficulties

- rejection sensitivity 

- emotional dysregulation 

- identity issues

- easily overwhelmed and overstimulated

- difficulties with people and masking

- impulsivity 

- certain body based behaviours (self harm, picking) 

But I don’t want to claim the label unfairly/take up space that isn’t mine as I know mental health conditions aren’t officially included 

(Although I haven’t actually been assessed for ADHD/Autism it could be a good idea because 8 members of my family are diagnosed autistic and 2 suspected ADHD) 

However I struggle to get across my needs to people in a way they understand, whilst on the other hand neurodivergence is being increasingly recognised and understood and (hopefully!!!) accepted and made space for - 

So I would just like some advice please if that’s ok - 

what would you feel comfortable me referring to myself or what do you think would best fit without again claiming space that isn’t mine! 

I was thinking neurodivergent adjacent but I don’t know if that also sounds like I’m trying to jump on a bandwagon (I promise I’m not! Just want to be understood with having so many similarities 🥲) 

Thank you 🙏🏻";;;;
2025-10-07 04:07:50;My recently diagnosed Asperguer (now ex) husband dumped me after 13 years together;"I'm an ADHD woman recently diagnosed too, and 6 months ago, while I was very sick with a cold and had been sick for months in the European winter, my also recently diagnosed aspie (ex) husband dumped me after I sent him a message upset because he had eaten all the medicine and had not thought of me not even as I was in bed feeling really ill (his cold was minor and he could go to class). He came back home with the medicine and told me I was right to be upset and that as I was telling him I was feeling like he was giving me ""crumps"", and all was because he realized he didnt love me as a partner anymore, that there was no way back and that the relationship was over. No chance to talk it over.

I was shocked, but was ready to respect if that was his feeling. I asked him for time to make sense of the situation and worked out what this meant for me. But he replied with a very agressive tone that the best for us was to live separately. And this rush was what broke me and made me feel discarded. We had so much history. And in that moment, we were both in a country that was not ours, I was with him on a partners visa as he was studying several posgraduate degrees, I was working and providing 2/3 of our shared income as he was on scholarships and before that I  supported us both while we lived in a neighboring country (before Europe) where he could not work (only me) as we had to exit our country because of political reasons. He is politically active and enjoys the attention and the political space (probably his monotopic). He was a target too.

After he dumped me he accepted he had resentment towards me as we left our country when he was being persecuted (along with others) and he felt I was driving him away from politics as we moved to a country without a strong diaspora from our country (because I was a dual citizen and I could work and support us financially). I felt his resentment and I brought it up many times but he denied it, and I decided to believe him. I kept telling him that my goal was to support us as a family, and that I supported his political activity but that relocation was for our project as a marriage. I guess he never believed that but couldnt find how to tell me?

It was during those years while I was supporting us that he was able to dedicate himself to get postgraduate scholarships to prestigious universities, and that eventually got us to Europe. Through it all, I felt I was sustaining the relationship but kept the hope things would get better once he was able to get his footing somewhere. But I guess I was wrong. The day he broke up the marriage he got the acceptance email from his dream PhD from a world top university. 

He had been struggling a lot during the months leading to the break up, it was 7 months after his Asperguers diagnosis and he was doing very challenging postgraduate degrees. He said that after he learned about his diagnosis he saw his feelings differently. I totally respect that and I really wanted to support him. However, I struggle to make sense of this all. The way he broke up with me was so painful after living so much together, and even when I know he can be a wonderful human being, I keep fighting the thought and feeling of having been used by someone I loved and being discarded so easily and abruptly. 

(Edited question and reflection after reading comments) Firstly, thank you for all the comments and answers. I recognize i am still very ignorant of ASD and asperger, and in my still confused post breakup state I did not articulate a fair question. 

So here is a another attempt: is ASD or his diagnosis related to the sudden nature of the breakup and the way it happened? (Given how he brought it up).";;;;

2025-10-07 03:55:48;Tics or stims?;"I’ve been formally diagnosed as “mildly autistic with OCD tendencies.” 

I’ve had this thing since I was about 10 or so where I blink really hard pretty frequently. It happens pretty much every day, probably hundreds of times throughout the day, but it’s worse when I’m tired or stressed or unwell. I also twitch or scrunch my nose up pretty frequently, but not as often (it’s been happening a lot today and yesterday and it’s annoying the hell out of me). 

Are these tics? Are they stims? They’re not true spasms, but I do feel compelled to do it and if I don’t I can’t stop thinking about doing it until I finally just do it, even absent-mindedly. I hate it, and it’s not really comforting in the way that other stims are. It’s also embarrassing to constantly be scrunching my face up in public. It does lessen if I’m focused or busy, but I have a pretty poor attention span so that’s rare. 

Regardless of what it is, does anyone have any idea how to make it stop? It’s really tiring. ";;;;
2025-10-07 01:41:55;How to tell if its really Asperger’s “ASD” and not complex ptsd?;"I’m currently in the process of getting a diagnosis— after four sessions, ASD already appeared in my assessment block, and my scores were medium-to-high. 

As a child, I didn’t line up toys or create strict symmetrical patterns. But I loved assembling LEGO and similar sets — building, connecting mechanical parts, making things work. I was drawn to structure and systems, but I wasn’t taught practical or “manual” skills at home —the focus was drawn to sports.

Now I’m trying to understand what behavioral patterns are actually systemic for Asperger’s in everyday life (beyond the stereotypes). What kinds of behaviors or experiences tend to stay consistent over time, even when someone has adapted socially?

And how can one distinguish between traits of Asperger’s and complex PTSD — since both can involve social withdrawal, sensory overload, or emotional shutdowns?

Would love to hear from people who’ve gone through similar assessments or self-discovery processes — especially if you’ve compared ASD traits with trauma responses.";;;;
2025-10-07 00:25:52;Masking at work - career switch?;"Hey everyone,

I wanted to ask for some advice. I'm a 25-year-old woman working as a speech therapist, and I was recently diagnosed with autism. It honestly felt like such a relief, especially after learning about masking, I recognized myself in it so much. Things I thought *everyone* did turned out not to be so universal after all.

In my job, I see about 15 clients a day, parents and their children, treating each child for about 30 minutes. I really enjoy the theory behind the work, but I’ve noticed that after two years of doing this full-time, I end every day completely mentally drained.

At first, people told me that this is just what full-time working life is like, so I pushed through. But I can’t imagine doing this for the rest of my life… I work from 8:30 to 17:00. Physically the job isn’t demanding, but mentally, it’s extremely exhausting. When I get home and have dinner, I usually need to sleep around 8 PM, and then I sleep until 11 PM, and then again around 12 PM until  the next day around 7 AM  just to get through the week.

So, I’m really curious, what kind of work did you do before you switched careers, or what do you do now? And if you experience something similar to what I’m going through, how do you manage it?

Thanks in advance ❤️";;;;
2025-10-06 22:58:30;"Idea: A crowdsourced ""what works"" site for autistic people. Would you use it?";"Hey all!

Could you please write whether such a website like described in the section **Idea** would be helpful for you or not, and other thoughts? I am primarily interested in whether it would be *useful* to you now or in the past, or others you know personally :)

# Background

I was recently diagnosed with Autism (highly masking and together with ADHD), am on extended sick leave and trying to build my live in a way that fits my needs (that I also not have discovered yet).
I wish there was a website like the one I am wishing for here, so I could learn new adaptions and needs faster. 

Also, during the burnout I noticed that I lived so long for what others wanted and that maybe the classical neurotypical goals of marriage, house, kids are not for me - I need some purpose in life, and improving the live of neurodiverse people seems worth doing, a lot! :)

# Idea

In a structured manner, collect advice in the form ""Problem - Solution"", have a voting system in place so that one can see which solutions are the most helpfull on average, and make that publically available 

- focus would initially be on dealing with sensory input, feeding oneself, social issues, ...

  - Country-specific stuff like specific accomondations would be out of scope for the beginning

- use Simple Language and tags to make every advice easily findable

- no free text entering so that less problems with moderation and copyright etc. arise - new problems/solutions would be found via decisions on a then created subreddit or discord server

# Principles

## Secure & Open & Free & Everyone in the spectrum

- Privacy of the people who vote is the most important concern and even higher than convienence of entering data (so for example: Users might have to jump through some hoops to participate in answering questions, if that makes it more safe). The goal should be: The databases could be hacked once every week, but no sensible data will be revealed

  - Technology like [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) might be able to achieve this

- It should be always free to view and free of ads

- It should be able to be used by research too

- There should be ways to not only have the voices of the terminally online (joking!), but also autists who are not able to type or otherwise unable/unlikely to contribute and vote

## No AI / other random-stuff-to-be-hip

Since the idea is not to generate profits and privacy is the top priority, there is not need to make is too fancy, put AI in it, etc.

The goal is to have an easily findable source of applicable information online - as low-tech as possible!

# Optional (Potentially useful, but not core to the idea)

## Other diagnoses

A natural extension would be ADHD, but also BPD would make sense, I guess - In a far future it might encompass much of the neurotypical spectrum.

## Web of Trust

The [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) (here: One can only vote if 2-3 people already in the web of trust vouch for one) method could be employed so that we could be more confident in the quality of the data, and a bit more safe against trolling. 

## More Data

Have not just a voting system, but also voter data (like: diagnosed/suspecting, other diagnoses, gender, rough age brackets)

- This would be really cool helpful, so one could try the approach first that are closest to ones own demographic

- **NOTE:** This would make the data even more sensible -> Higher need for data security

## Citizen Science - Survey Page

This would be something separate, however using the same technology. The idea here is to aid research by doing [citizen science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) - by collecting answers to all kind of questions, how the answers change over time, and so on. This could prove to become a help to research if big amounts of data could be collected! As someone adjacent to clinical research, I know how hard it is sometimes to collect data - it would be great to have an additional, hopefully reliable source of information about how autism affects our lives.

# Potential next steps

If people think this would a net positive, I think I would be able to initiate, organize and implement much of the stuff (security related stuff excluded of course, would bring a bunch of experts on board first). Since I am in a burnout rn, I would take it slow - the whole project would progress according to ""slow, and steady"".

*tl;dr:* I'm thinking of creating a free, anonymous website with a ""Problem - Solution"" format where autistic people can vote on advice for things like sensory issues, feeding, etc. Would this be helpful to you?";;;;
2025-10-06 16:43:37;Positive experiences with getting diagnosed?;I think we tend to hear a lot about how terrible of an experience someone had with the mental health field, and I wonder how much of that comes from the human tendency to only speak up when we have a really problematic experience, as opposed to the times we feel like we've been understood and carefully considered. I'm interested in hearing about it.;;;;

2025-10-06 13:31:37;i feel weird;"im not diagnosed with anything other than anxiety (since i was little) but ive always felt like ive related to ppl with ocd, and recently even autism - mostly the social aspect. it feels like im masking. i dont think anyone suspects me to be neurodivergent but everyone calls me extremely quiet. i have all the symptoms i experience written down, except i dont even experience a lot of them right now bc of school work. or maybe i grew out of these symptoms and never was neurodivergent? 

im just scared to say anything because what if im not neurodivergent? then i waste everyones time and have more of a reason to doubt myself because i got it wrong. i feel like those ppl on tiktok who self diagnose to be quirky 😭

anyways i made a school guidance appt and included this in the note:

- i've always kinda related to neurodivergent people and im not sure if i should look into it

i dont know what they will do, ive never told anyone. if i really want to do anything about it then id have to tell my parents (but do i really wanna do that?) it feels like a small problem (what i experience is quite subtle compared to others), is it really worth going through all that effort? except i do genuinely want some clarity";;;;
2025-10-06 13:06:53;Anyone else relate to people with other disorders that aren't ASD?;"I can't access to a diagnosis now (I'm pretty sure I have other disorders aside ASD though) but lately i'm starting to interact with ND's who don't have ASD or ADHD.

I never related to the classical asperger struggles, my problems are more cognitive than social (I have an IQ of 83), I enjoyed discovering this sub at first but I also feel that the schizoids and narcissists problems fits with me better.


I never tried to fit in and I simply can't mask even if I tried because my low IQ, but I have a lots of problems with shame and feeling ""cringe"" when me or someone express their suffering, I can understand why some of these posts are so depressing but those are just life experiences I don't share, I'm also a really grateful person so that's why I had to permanently block friends of mine (neurotypicals) that told me they struggled with suicide thoughts or self harm, I can't STAND people who aren't aware how easy their lives are.

That's why I love subs of people with ""calm"" personality disorders like NPD, ASPD or SPD, they acknowledge their problems but never try to seek attention or make people feel pity for them, when I used to work I a mental hospital I had to deal with a lot of neurotypicals threatened me of killing themselves, but I never had those experiences when it comes to people with hard problems y'know?";;;;
2025-10-06 09:38:31;Parent with high functioning autism ?;So this is hard to say because my parent never got diagnosed but I always suspected my mom to have either high social anxiety or Asperger’s. When I was younger my mom had trouble in Public settings and relationships with people- for example being over shadowed by my dad. Laughing nervously over nothing. She didn’t have any close friends because she lost contact. She didn’t get along with my relatives. Not because she wasn’t nice or smart but because she didn’t get social clues and was overly nice almost a door mat. There was an aunt who my mom hated because she was so mean to my mom- moved down the block from us and would compare my cousins with them. Also- other signs was her not picking up social clues. Not knowing how to do finances or notice if I am having a bad day. She’s very ignorant to emotions. But what made me think it’s just social anxiety and he personality was that she was the bread winner and worked my whole life. I’m confused and I suspect my dad also had his own struggles because he couldn’t do financials either. Both of them neglected their health a lot and also ours. Also I thought they got rid of the term aspergers. Another thing is I can right away tell if someone else is on the spectrum with other people ;;;;
2025-10-06 08:12:50;Am I really Autistic ???;"Hi all,

This is partially a vent, but also a documentation of my journey as an ""autistic"" woman (F21).

I constantly feel like I do not fit the criteria of the diagnosis for autism because my problems seem so minimal at times. There are times when I have no issues for weeks. But then I feel like it could just be anxiety. I have an official diagnosis, and the people who tested me said I barely passed, but all of the professionals said I should have the diagnosis anyway. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't identify with autistic people because I don't stim enough or have a special interest in the same way. It doesn't help that these symptoms overlap so much with anxiety, depression, and ADHD (All of which a lot of my family has). Also, no one in my family takes me seriously! They all think I don't have it, and I'm being dramatic. How am I supposed to know if I have it 100%?

Some symptoms include:

\- Finger picking since birth -Issues with eye contact and social cues

\-Stimming in multiple ways (Leg bouncing, vocal repetition, mimicking, playing with hair, finger tapping)

\-Having an interest in wildlife since birth - Constant burnout and feeling like an outcast

\-Struggling to fit in or make/keep friends

My question is... What am I??? I'm so confused :(";;;;

What would that map or manual have in it?;"Full disclosure I’m not autistic, but I was assumed to have autism for about 30 years before being eventually diagnosed with BPD. 

I’m asking because this is the question that I’d always receive that made people believe I was autistic, because my answers to this question were deemed “very socially off in some way, but not in a way that is normally seen in autism” I’ve always felt that it seems like most people get some kind of ingrained manual on cultural semiotics that I’m missing and I’ve always just had to guess, and frequently guess wrong. 

I’m wondering what kind of manual you wish you could have received, or where such a manual could have helped. 

—--

Edit: To add my own example, the one I gave my therapist was that when I’m going on a date, I’m not sure if I should wear the AFI: Black Sails in the Sunset shirt or the AFI: Sing The Sorrow shirt. The first one is more Misfits inspired, and the second one leans more into religious iconography and the singer’s personal feelings, plus it’s much more theatrical. Black Sails carries a vibe of ‘liking it before it was cool’ and Sing the Sorrow has more of a vibe of ‘this band is slightly effeminate’ which can be good in the right crowd but it also runs the risk of giving the vibe of ‘I bought this shirt at Hot Topic when everyone got into this band’ in the wrong crowd. 

If someone I have a crush on can give me an offhand comment about how Sing The Sorrow was a shitty album because Davey sings like a girl, they might forget they said that five minutes later, but it’ll stick in my head for 15 years as I think “I shouldn’t wear that shirt because it’s a bad one, and I might be a bad person for liking it, and what does the fact that I do like that album say about my masculinity?”

For a second example, I’ve had endless debates with myself, with Reddit, and in the past year, with AI over what certain truck brands ‘mean.’ The general consensus is that: 

* Ford is dependable, like Hank Hill
* Chevy is dependable, but slightly edgy, more like a country singer
* RAM is more like a bonfire partier or SoundCloud rapper (my own vibe)
* Toyota is bulletproof but carries an energy of being for nerds 
* Nissan is just as reliable as the others but carries a vibe of being not as serious

With both of these examples, I want someone to tell me the right answer, and according to my therapist, I’m constantly scanning every concept that could exist for potential symbolic meanings when to the majority of people, most things don’t mean anything. People wear the shirt they like and buy the truck they can afford. I can’t imagine what it might feel like to not be constantly analyzing the potential meaning of something I’m doing or wearing or buying. ";;;;
2025-10-06 06:46:32;Question About Hyperfixations and Neurotypical Folks.;So, I'm someone who has diagnosed Autism and ADHD (ADD). I've noticed that friends who are neurotypical tend to swap to other things within the blink of an eye while I'm in the middle of enjoying myself. Like, quite literally moving onto something else within five or ten minutes, while I tend to indulge in things for hours-days-weeks. Sometimes months depending on how much content there is for what I'm enjoying. Is that common?;;;;
2025-10-06 04:26:54;Burnout and I'm TIRED.;"Ok, so I have multiple neurodivergencies. I have Dyspraxia, OCD, Dyscalculia, anxiety and yet to be diagnosed albeit clinically obvious ASD and ADHD. I'm a cis woman, 30 years old. Currently don't have a cycle due to continuous birth control. I'm in therapy with a neuroaffirming therapist, who is also neurodivergent. I will be talking to her about this. I'm happily engaged to a man who is also neurodivergent.

My OCD themes are contamination, health and relationship based. 

Ever since last summer, after my second COVID of infection, my health anxiety has been through the roof. Every ache, sneeze, cough, twinge. Every time I hear someone make a bodily expulsion. It's exhausting. My grandmother passed last September and that made things worse. My fiancé was diagnosed with OCD this year and he's had a rough summer, so my brain is split into twelve different pieces. I had RSV in June, which didn't help. My therapist said I'm in burnout. My fiancé says I'm in burnout.

My body has decided that anxiety will also manifest in physical pains now. A week or so after a meltdown or anxiety inducing event, there is a chance of my joints aching, my face hurting, feeling a funny feeling in my throat and head. As you can imagine it's triggering my COVID OCD. It's also completely random. 

I had a massive meltdown last week because of my silly goose brain and lo and behold, an exact week later I get achy joints and back. My head is funny, not a headache. Completely dissociated. Dry throat that isn't sore but annoying. Near tears constantly. My brain is screaming to take a COVID test, but I feel it isn't that. I genuinely think this is all related to my weird ass neurodivergent experience. My fiancé has experienced the exact same thing as me, and agrees. My OCD does not. My fiancé is worried about me. I'm worried about me. I'm tired.

It's been a lot my dudes.

Edit: I've noticed the typo and I'm leaving it because it's applicable to my fried egg head right now.

Edit 2: taking COVID tests is a huge compulsion for me so I'm trying to not take one unless I feel like a dying Victorian child who longs for the sea.";;;;
2025-10-05 23:37:53;Labels are useless and self diagnosis is valid. Change my mind.;"I’ve been diagnosed with so many mental issues over the past decade from different mental health professionals (gone through at least 5 psychiatrists and a couple therapists). Bipolar, borderline, depression, anxiety, ocd, autism, depersonalization/derealization, ptsd, hppd, psychosis, schizophrenia. Tried probably dozens of different medications. And now I’m off literally all of them, because I have had my onset of epilepsy and they were all contributing to a lowered seizure threshold. And I’m fine. I’m more stable than I was when I was on that concoction of medications. So what is the point of these labels other than insurance purposes? Because I’m obviously not all of these things. So many symptoms are overlapping. And everyone has a different opinion of what they think is wrong with me. So I’ve decided to not give a fuck about the diagnoses anymore. I’m neurodivergent. My brain is wired differently and that’s all there is to it. 

EDIT: I’ve posted an update to this post addressing your comments. Feel free to check it out if you’d like. But thank you for your responses. I really do appreciate it. 🫶";;;;

2025-10-05 12:46:27;Help with neurodivergent child please;"I don't even know where to start..I made this reddit account for this sole purpose. My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with ADHD - combined type, GAD and OCD. She recently started taking vyvanse 2 months ago and as of today just upped her dose and she started zoloft 1 month ago and just upped her dose. There's a couple things she's been doing that have been driving me insane and I don't know how to combat it. If we are conversating, she'll end the conversation with ""okay"" or ""alright"" or ""good"" or ""oh"" and then she'll repeat it again and again until I confirm to her verbally that I heard her..even though responses like ""okay/alright/good/oh"" should Not need a verbal acknowledgement. (For the record, I should probably note that she is homeschooled and has only ever been homeschooled, but we are hoping we can enroll her in private school next school year.) Another thing she has been doing is she has a list she has to go through before doing certain things, example: if she is gonna have a snack and watch cartoons then before she does she has to say grace, I have to say amen too, then her baby dolls say amen then she explains to me how her baby dolls mispronounced it because they are just babies, then she tells me okay everyone said amen now, then she tells me she loves me and that I'm the best then she makes her babies say it too and then she tells me that everyone loves everyone and thinks everyone is the best, then she tells me to let her know if there's anything cute or anything funny or anything she likes on my phone (like if I'm watching YouTube or something) the issue is she'll repeat alllllll of this stuff in order every single time she sits down for a snack at the counter. She also does this to strangers at grocery stores. She loves to compliment people then start talking to them, but she has this list in her head already of what she plans on telling them. She has to make them guess her age, she tells them about her hamster, she tells them his full name, she'll even tell them about her baby dolls, their names, their ages, and even sometimes about her big stuffed crayon toy that she pretends is her husband and his pretend age and the age she pretends she is..etc. and oh, if I try cutting it short and walking away before she gets to finish she gets very distressed. She has no social awareness when people make faces at her for it or if people clearly don't want to be spoken to. She is always stressed that people don't hear her. She is also obsessed with babies and toddlers. I'm not exaggerating at all here. She gets distressed if she misses the opportunity to tell a stranger that she likes their baby. She'll even start yelling it to them. If she misses the chance then she'll start saying ""but what if they think I don't like their baby ?"" ..and I tell her they don't even know you exist. If she compliments a stranger and they don't respond then she starts either repeating what she said again, or asking ""did you hear me ?"" or even going tap them to get some kind of response. I just don't know what to do anymore.. I've been dealing with this for so long and her last therapist dropped us, so we are currently on the search for a better one. What do I need to do to get her to stop stressing so much over being heard, especially for words like ""alright"" ? Correct me if I'm wrong, but could this be her OCD being exacerbated by the vyvanse ? I've read that is possible. Any genuine advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !";;;;
2025-10-05 10:00:27;Advice for getting through autistic meltdowns?;"Hello. I just wanted to preface this by saying I am very new to the community, so please correct me if I have any incorrect information. 

I am 26F and I have recently learned that I am autistic. For as long as I can remember, I have been having what I now know are autistic meltdowns (harming myself, uncontrollable crying, etc). Since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at age 20, I chalked it up to that. However, these meltdowns never stopped happening even after years of medication and therapy. 

Last night I had a horrible meltdown. I have been very stressed from working full-time and going to school full-time. My supervisor made a comment about how I need to be more confident, and that I should ""try to talk a little more naturally"" (I am seeing mental health clients, so these comments make sense). I was so frustrated hearing this, because, as an autistic person, these things are difficult for me.

All of these things combined into a meltdown. I was crying hysterically, hitting my head against the wall, scratching myself, yelling about how I hate myself, you get the picture. This lasted for about 3 hours. 

Is there any way to make getting through an autistic meltdown a little easier? It is so exhausting and I wish I just had a way to either avoid them or make them not as intense. Any advice is welcome!";;;;

2025-10-04 17:45:59;Realizing I have experienced a lot of trauma in life;"It is not easy being autistic. There are things I like and appreciate about myself. I am a creative person and have a passion for writing. But I have come to realize that my life has been so difficult at times. I am often highly critical of myself. I am so used to having my flaws and mistakes pointed out. When you hear how you are constantly not doing something right, or you are shamed because of how your brain works, it can wound your self esteem. It can cause things like self doubt, anxiety and depression to build. I find ways to get through the pain I carry. I try to surround myself with people that validate how I feel and respect how I feel

I was diagnosed with autism at age 14. I went to a very small school. As a child, my mother helped to get me accommodations in school and special learning classes. I've always needed extra help and support with things and my parents have always been here for me. I loved learning in school. I was a creative child with a vivid imagination. My special interest has always been writing. I poured my energy into art and creative writing classes at school. At a young age, I began writing my own books. I would work on these books every single day, after I got home from school, I had few friends and endured frequent bullying from the other children during school. Kids were cruel and singled me out for the smallest things. I was very shy and still am. I did not talk much and would remain quiet most of the day at school. I shared very little information about myself with the other kids. I was introverted and preferred to keep to myself. I disliked drama and attention. The popular kids at my school were very loud, extroverted and loved being involved in drama. They would tease me for not talking. When they became aware of how much I liked to write, they would criticize my writing abilities, after I took the time to share a creative writing story for the class. They did not realize all the time I was spending after school writing and creating my own books, by hand. My family are the only ones I ever showed the books to. Except one time, when I chose to take one of the books I had written to school. The kids who were often mean to me or ignored me were impressed with the book I wrote and wanted to know how I came up with the idea. I thought they would be mean about it, or say something rude to me. They were not. They were nice to me and interested in what I wrote. And this is the only time I can remember the kids who frequently bullied me actually being nice to me about something

It was not just the kids at school that would bully me but also some of the teachers. They also noticed how quiet I was and would make rude comments. At my school, people would find any reason to dislike you. They even picked on kids who were smart and enjoyed studying. I was someone who also happened to enjoy studying and focusing on my school work. And they would use this as a reason to bully me even more. They tried to get my attention, by asking me why I didn't talk more. I wanted to have friends. I did not want to be bullied. But I simply could not pretend to be something I was not, to impress them. I put up with the name calling. I went home sometimes in tears. I had anxiety, often before I stepped through the front doors of the school building. During lunchtime, I would often sit in the library by myself, instead of the cafeteria, where I knew I would be more likely to be picked on. I knew each day at school would be difficult. But I found peace in my writing. It took me away from the pain and lifted my spirits, when I felt crushed under the weight of it all. A few people at school were nice to me and didn't pick on me. But I never had a close friend or a best friend. Surrounded by classmates who were unwilling to understand me, each day at school was lonely and painful. I kept trying to come up with a reason as to why I made them so angry. I was just being myself. I wasn't rude to them and didn't like to argue. But I was never accepted by people at school. This trauma has never left me

I have also endured trauma as an adult. I have been gaslit when I complained about something and told the way I was feeling can't be real. This was hurtful, but I try to remind myself that not everyone is always going to understand what I go through. Some people in life are going to be mean. They won't be able to empathize with your pain or your problems. They can't put themselves in your shoes. But there are also kind people in life, people who will never talk down to you. I was also bullied by adults in my life. It brough back memories of the bullying I endured in school, but I got through it. I made a few friends, but I only had one close friend. She was truly a kind person. She was not fake. She liked talking to me. She was there to listen whenever I had a problem. I would listen to her problems. She was always polite. Being friends with her made me feel less alone. When my friend passed away, I felt so sad. I have never forgotten her. I have never met anyone else like her. I have people in my life I can confide in and talk to. But not a friend like her. 

My parents are the type of people who do a lot for me. They help buy my groceries. I do not drive so they often have to drive me to appointments or anywhere else I need to go. They help me fill out forms and other important things. They are sometimes not emotionally available. They are caring and good parents, but at times, they aren't the sort of people you can have deep conversations with. My mother is the more emotionally distant one. She put a lot of time and effort into helping to make my life easier. But now that she is older, she seems to be disappointed in me. Maybe this is just me overthinking things, but that is the feeling I get. I will likely always need extra help and support in life. And there is nothing wrong with this. When my parents are gone, someone will have to help me with things. Socializing is never an easy thing. I go to therapy to talk about my trauma and it is helping me process things. I have a better understanding of myself

It is important to talk about difficult things you go through in life. When you never talk about it, then it creates shame. The shame can build and increase feelings of anxiety and depression. I have always expressed myself better through writing than speaking. When I start to write, it instantly makes me feel better and puts me in a calmer place. When I feel like no one could possibly understand what I go through, I know I am not alone. When my brain convinces me that I am alone, I am reminded I have people who care about me and want to see me happy. I have always been a creative person. Whenever I am feeling sad, I can write a poem or a story and I feel better. Putting the words on paper or typing them out releases any sadness I am feeling. Often times, I write about difficult things I struggle with. I hope my writing connects with others and lets them know they are not alone. It is okay to not feel okay. If you feel sad, write down what you feel. You do not have to keep it inside or feel ashamed for feeling deeply about things

If you were ever bullied, ignored, made to feel bad about who you are, or felt like you had to hide who you are to fit in, you are not alone. You are not too much. You are not too difficult. You are not a problem. The mind is complex, but the mind can be beautiful. There is only one you. You don't have to give up your integrity to be liked by others. It is not as important as what others think about you, as what you think of yourself. Your writing may mean a lot to you. You can put all your heart and soul into it. One person may not like what you say. Don't allow this to discourage you, because plenty of other people in the world may love to hear what you have to say. 

On days you feel let down, remember there is a light in you that cannot be dimmed

There is a fire that can't be put out

There is an energy that can't be contained and must be put down on paper

The kindest people sometimes endure the most hardships. Overcoming those hardships makes you strong. You are not weak like the bullies tried to make you believe.

2025-10-04 07:54:26;Wondering if I'm just ADHD or am actually AuDHD?;"I've been questioning for a little while now whether I'm just ADHD or am AuDHD. Before, I thought I was just ADHD, but after realizing all of my symptoms I have, especially during my childhood, I've started to realize that I may also have Autism and am on the high-functioning spectrum of it.

Like most commonly, I have the combined ADHD type symptoms (Forgetfulness/brain fog, disorganization, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, impatience, maladaptive daydreaming, hyperfixations, fidgeting/restlessness, temperamental/significant mood swings, etc.).

But I also have symptoms that seem a lot like Autism, especially during my childhood, like hyper-sensitivity (I would have meltdowns over the texture of my hair and clothes, and I still have this issue), stimming (spinning, hand flapping and mouth noises), sensory stimulation habits (I used to have an obsession with sucking on my arms to the point that I'd give myself hickeys), and I have very special interests/hobbies that I would spend hours and hours looking for as much details and information about as possible, and I'd be so intensely focused on it that that's all I'd wanna do/spend time on.

I also was often considered really smart and gifted for my age, and I was especially SUPER creative and imaginative, I was ALWAYS coming up with so many drawings and stories to the point that I needed like two to three moving bins to fit all of it, LoL. XD  So my parents, mostly my dad, always expected me to get honor rolls at school and never get anything below an 80 and always encouraged me to make art and write stories. Though, when I hit my teenage years, I lost a lot of that drive and creativity I had when I was little, and I don't know why. It's not that I don't have any interest in my hobbies or interests anymore, I do still have a lot of love and passion for them, I'm just super burnt out now and am really sad about it.

My little brother was diagnosed with Autism super young, and he shows much more 'obvious' signs than I do. People say that those with Autism aren't really emotionally intelligent and struggle with social cues, just like my little brother, but I'm the complete opposite and am actually extremely empathetic and super receptive to other peoples' feelings and emotions, and I usually don't have much trouble with reading social cues. And usually people with Autism also don't like change or being out-of-routine, but I am also almost the complete opposite of that, I HATE routine and need constant change and excitement because I can't STAND boredom and mundaneness. X(

So, I'm really not sure. I know ADHD is said to have overlapping symptoms with Autism, but I feel like a lot of the stuff I did as a kid seemed a LOT like Autism. But like I said, I still am not sure. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I would appreciate if anyone could just help or give a little advice! Because I was undiagnosed as a kid, I've been trying to learn as much as I can about myself to understand how my brain works and what kind of support I need to manage my symptoms, since I never got that support as a kid and have always just struggled silently most of my life because of it. :/";;;;
2025-10-04 05:58:29;is this considered dangerous stimming?;Yesterday I was listening to a song from a show in which a character I'm obsessed with sings. I was so extremely overjoyed and happy about it and out of excitement i started scratching my hand aggressively to let out the extreme emotion, and ended up ripping the skin off half the back of hand, making it bleed and leaving an injury that will probably leave a pretty big scar once it's healed. Is this stimming? It's not the first time i react violently to the literally unbearable feeling of happiness and excitement, but it was never this bad. I would appreciate if anyone who's had a similar experience could share some advice on how to avoid this because I'm scared it could get worse (I'm not diagnosed with anything by the way, so if it is stimming I don't know precisely why I do this. I am planning to see a therapist for now);;;;
2025-10-04 05:47:04;Help for Upcoming Neuropsych Eval;"     Hi, this might sound really silly, but I’m looking for some tips and help with my upcoming neuropsych evaluation. I, 23F, am quite positive I have high masking autism and possibly ADHD. I was evaluated during COVID for ADHD exclusively, and I had an awful experience and it was quite traumatic. The evaluation lady framed it as “Anxiety vs ADHD” quoted in the reason for referral. She also used some pretty abrasive rhetoric such as me “complaining” about poor memory but my memory seems to function fine, and that there is a small chance I have ADHD and if I ever were to be reassessed and diagnosed that the doctors should proceed with extreme caution due to diagnosing me with crippling anxiety. I do not, in the slightest, believe that I have crippling anxiety. My actual diagnosis is “GAD with panic and obsessive compulsive traits”. She also took 0 outside input from family, friends, or loved ones so she only had my own perception of myself to go off of. I have been dealing with some pretty extreme burnout from work to the point where I feel it’s effecting my job performance, and it’s becoming harder and harder to perform as I usually do mentally, physically, and emotionally. I feel that this is all due to masking and as an adult becoming more and more exhausted by this. I have a plethora of other reasons why I believe Autism rather than ADHD, or a small possibility it may be both, but I’ll spare those details unless it’s needed for advice. 
     Basically I’m just coming here to ask for help. My previous assessor was a woman, and this time it’s a man. Has anyone else been diagnosed late? Are there things I should be sure to mention? This facility wasn’t going to take outside input either, but I’m pressing them. They said my significant other could either email in a statement or attend the intake with me, which I will make sure at least one of those happens. I’m worried that being an adult female stack the cards against me for the second time. I don’t know what I’m seeing out of this. Maybe workplace accommodations? What adult workplace accommodations do you have as a high-masking low support needs autistic person? Thank you all for your help. 🫶

2025-10-04 04:35:11;Wellbutrin and its effect on the auDHD brain;"I'm officially diagnosed with low support level autism and a bit of ADHD. I took all kinds of SSRI for years because they were trying to treat what they falsely attributed to generalized anxiety disorder. It never worked, it only made me gain weight while making me feel like a robot with no emotion. The subject of Wellbutrin came when I realized most of that ""anxiety"" came from an overactive brain. First, I was put on 150XL tablet. I had a bit of insomnia, but it gave me a good amount of energy too. Anxiety was more manageable as if I gained the ability to control my train of thoughts more easily. I was able to stop abusing coffee to make it through the day.

But then, the bad effects came after two weeks. I got this brain fog which I couldn't get myself out of. I had difficulty articulating my thoughts and it was a huge problem since slow processing was already part of my autism. So, I asked to see if I could switch to 100SR tablet and they told me I could split it in half if I wanted. I ended trying half a pill (50mg) and there were still too many side effects (brain fog, feeling a bit numbed out). So, I decided to split in quarter (25mg) and I feel it's more manageable. I get less anxiety while still feeling present in the moment. 

My question is : does anyone else with autism experienced the same thing? When I told the pharmacist I wanted to only take half a pill, she made sure to remind me it wasn't even above the threshold for a therapeutic dose. Then, I reminded her that autistic people often get strange reaction to medication, especially with pills that impact the brain. I heard that it was because we have more neurotransmitters. Too bad I had to waste 25 years of my life to realize my autistic brain was peculiar and antidepressants would affect me in a different way than most people.";;;;
2025-10-04 04:15:50;How to communicate to your workplace and colleagues that I am on the spectrum?;"Basically the title. Some people at my workplace already know, but most of them don't.

I've had a situation yesterday at work that I also vented about on reddit and one commenter said that it could've been avoided when they would have known about my diagnosis to which I agree. 

But I surely won't write a message to all of them and making like a formal statement. I don't want pity, just understanding or acknowledgement. I also don't want to mention it completely out of the blue since I wouldn't want to be perceived as pick me and since this is a topic that doesn't come up in normal conversations where I could participate I am kinda lost. 

Any advice on it?";;;;

2025-10-04 03:44:08;is it okay for me to use communication cards?;"i didn't really know where else to ask this 😓
(also a small note: i'm 16 and in college and apologies if i don't make sense in some cases idk how to explain this well)

i'm not diagnosed with anything and i don't want to say that i do have anything but i sometimes struggle to communicate in some situations. i don't really know how to specifically describe it but it my throat feels really tight and i feel like im spiralling in my own thoughts during these situations where i struggle communicating.. like it's almost as if my body physically won't allow me to speak if you get what i mean. before the whole meeting i had which is explained underneath this, when i was in these situations (and obviously had no alternatives) i would force myself to speak which feels really uncomfy for me but moving on

Last week i had this ""1 on 1"" meeting with one of my teachers and i shared with them that i struggle with this difficulty to communicate so they recommended that i make communication cards so i have an alternative to use in that case so i ended up making them. Yesterday i had another ""1 on 1"" meeting with another teacher and ngl i felt a bit ... embarrassed or a bit off ? i mean i was using the communication cards that i made and i was also typing + writing out my responses since i now have those alternatives but i still felt a bit off like may just be that i'm just really shy and i'm just mocking other people in some way that really do need it. my teacher did reassure me that i can write down my response or type them out but i was still a bit off and hesitant about it. but at the same time though i've struggled communicating for like a good 5-4 years by now which is like since maybe year 7 or year 8 and i've genuinely never told anyone about this struggle so this is all a bit new to me...

about 2 days ago i also posted my communication cards on tiktok because i felt comfortable enough to post it. originally i just wanted people to recognise the fandoms i'm in like ""oh you're in [fandom name] me too!"" which sounds a bit unrealistic since it's tiktok and i wasn't expecting that there wasn't going to be any hate since obviously no matter what you do or post you'll always be judged or hated one way or another 😭
there's been users saying that it's weird to use communication cards or any alternatives to communicate when you don't have a disability or diagnosis as it's meant for people who are disabled/diagnosed to which i've been replying with that ""communication cards can be used by everyone"" and ""you dont need to be diagnosed to need communication cards"" but the amount of comments i've been getting that's similar to this has made me confused now whether i really can use alternatives to communicate even though i've replied to many comments that everyone can use them ☹️

can someone please clarify for me that i am able to use alternatives to communicate even though there's nothing i'm diagnosed with? 🙁

2025-10-04 01:21:33;Is it normal for sensory symptoms become more noticeable after a diagnosis?;"I was recently diagnosed with Asperger's (well, grade 1 autism). I've always been very introverted, and not great at social interaction. But academically I've always done well; Good memory, accelerated learning, and well, since I was 9 years old, I've had very advanced knowledge for my age, and even now at 14, I understand some neuroscience principles

That said, for as long as I can remember, I've never focused on sensory issues. Yes, I perceived discomfort from noises, and my reaction was simply to avoid them, without dwelling on them too much.

Unlike now, since I received the diagnosis, I feel that the discomfort is becoming more noticeable: ringing in my ears, headaches, and even sensory meltdowns.

I guess its because I now know about my diagnosis and am more aware of those kinds of things.

But I still have questions; is this normal? Did they intensify with time and/or diagnosis?

Why I think I have ADHD and Autism? I checked the DSM 5 and differentiation between them by using it. I also logged for 3 weeks about my symptoms with school logs, exam logs. I've been dismissed 3 times because I don't fit the stereotype and instead of making me better, it just made me worse. I'm already in my burnout stage and I just want  to understand myself. The meds doesn't work aside from making me fall asleep. Not helping executive dysfunction, memory lapses, not clearly explaining myself, sensory sensitivities,  difficulty starting things, forgets what to say mid-sentence, needs routines but struggles to stick to them, feels drained after social interaction or waiting in noisy crowds, obsesses over certain topics, quick learner when interested, struggles when not, and etc. I experience this every single day and I'm still dismissed as only anxiety. ;;;;
2025-10-03 18:48:31;Does anyone else feel that they never masked much because they leaned into their social awkwardness?;I received an official autism diagnosis earlier this year after going through over 4 decades of my life undiagnosed. After reading a lot of things online about autism, I was able to relate to a lot things, but masking was something I don’t feel like I do too much with the exception of formal situations that I can’t avoid. I think that it’s because I realized early on that I wasn’t going to be the “cool kid” and, frankly, had no desire to be cool by most peoples’ standards, so I leaned very hard into my “geekiness”. I decided if I was going to be the geek, I might as well go all the way and not bother to try to fit in, much to my parents’ chagrin. Even as an adult, I continued to pursue my own hobbies and hang out with a small group of friends who get me, so I don’t feel like I really mask that often;;;;
2025-10-03 15:35:33;Struggling to get diagnosed;"For a long time I’ve known I had something, never completely clear on what I had but definitely something that made my brain work differently then others. But I never tell anyone because I hear all the time about people complaining about those who self diagnose just because of little things and I’m paranoid people will think the same of me. Plus a diagnose might help me fix issues I’ve been trying to deal with my entire life. 

However, my dad completely refuses the fact that I have anything, saying stuff like “You’re too smart” or some bullshit like that. He says, to the guy who almost failed high-school because of history homework he got assigned months ago to do and had literal stack of math homework I hadn’t done in elementary school despite loving math. Despite this, he still took me to the doctor, but I don’t even remember what happened, because nothing really did. I think I was given some kind of medicine or maybe a therapist but it never really went further than that.

I’m 19 years old and live in a very small town, the clinic is on the clear opposite side of town and I’ve been too scared to drive to get a license. I don’t know what to do. My dad literally messaged me that he would rather believe the myths behind it than the factual evidence I tried to send him. I really really don’t want to drag my dad into this again but without transport I don’t know how I am supposed to do this myself.

2025-10-03 11:11:39;Is this really how it’s always going to be?;"Hi everyone,

I feel worn down from work and honestly a bit hopeless. Across different jobs, I keep ending up in the same place: mistreated, ostracised, or scapegoated until I can’t take it anymore and leave.

Some examples:

* **Farm work:** I stayed in one farm job for several years even though I was mistreated (severely) almost every single day. Then I switched farms, and somehow the manager there treated me even worse. I even had an offsider who didn’t respect my position, and I was constantly undermined. I felt isolated and unwanted the whole time.
* **Shopping mall security:** I worked in a mall where the communication was always breaking down between supervisors, management, and guards. It was exhausting. I was expected to be a superhero, never show fatigue, and constantly handle chaos with no proper support. I burned out and got fired after calling in sick too often.
* **Factory job:** A younger guy in his 20s decided to pick on me day after day. Eventually, I blew up, lost my cool at him, and then just walked off the job and quit. I couldn’t stomach staying in a place where bullying was allowed to go on like that.
* **More recently:** I thought security at a bottle shop might be cushy — stand around, minimal interaction, keep to myself. But even there, staff lied to me, threatened me, and treated me like I was disposable. The company offered no support, no gear, and no growth. And when a client complained, they turned on me instantly. I resigned rather than sit through another humiliating “disciplinary meeting.”

I’m autistic (diagnosed formally since 2015), and I can’t help but wonder if this is part of the problem. Maybe I don’t play office politics, maybe I show my emotions too much (or not enough or perhaps incorrectly!), maybe I can’t tolerate lies and hypocrisy the way others seem to. But it feels like no matter what job I take, I eventually end up ostracised, bullied, or treated like garbage - even when I just try to keep to myself to avoid stepping on a social landmine.

Is this just the reality for people like us? Do any of you manage to find workplaces where you’re actually respected, supported, and not treated as disposable? Or am I always going to be running into the same wall over and over again?";;;;
2025-10-03 08:04:18;When even professionals don't get autism in women;"After years of wondering, struggling, and having my autistic traits pointed out by others, I finally connected with a professional. She's honestly very nice! However, as I shared my suspicions and experiences, she responded with: ""Well, don't you think that if you're autistic, it would have been flagged and you'd have been diagnosed when you were little? Wouldn't the adults around you—parents, teachers—have noticed?"" 

That kind of threw me for a loop because this would have been the 90s and early 2000s, and I was a high-achieving, ""quirky"", chameleon of a girl with parents who didn't know anything about autism outside of the movie *Rain Man* and teachers who loved me because I was quiet and set a good example.

So, no. Nobody flagged anything. 

She agreed to do a screening, but I'm still feeling discouraged. ";;;;
2025-10-03 06:37:47;Did big stims in public for the first time;"The main way l've been getting regular social contact during burnout is going to the pool in the evening when it tends to be more quiet. I can almost always go, but sometimes like today I get stuck while transitioning from locker room to pool. When I'm trying to put my swimsuit on and I can't stop stimming it's hard for me to know why it's happening and what to do. 

I've use a method which maybe some of you can relate to. I think of myself as two people, the one who takes care of me and has some self awareness (""I notice I'm stimming a lot let's try to figure out why"" ""I have a headache when did I eat last"" etc) and the autistic part of me (the one who wants to do art stuff instead of eating, the one who is stimming) the negotiation went like this:

(in locker room)
person 1: 1 really want to go and swim. It'd be really good for us. person 2: no that's too overwhelming flap flap flap 1: okay, what if we just put the swimsuit on? 2: okay, but just the bottoms head shakey stim 1:... okay. Good. Let's go out and try to sit by the pool. 2: flaps a lot definitely not 1: what if we wore headphones in addition to the sunglasses and earplugs? 2: calms a little maybe. But I don't want to put all my stuff in a locker. 1: okay we can bring it with us. 2: okay fine I'll try it but as soon as it's too much we leave 1: yes, as soon as it's too much I'll get you out of there

 …and on and on until I settled on an agreement that worked for both sides. I knew it was really important for me to at least try to be at the pool because it's an important part of my routine and I needed to see some people. It also meant that I was gonna be the most ""out"" as autistic l've ever been in public.

I went and sat by the pool with all my gear on and was mostly fine. Sometimes if someone on the other side of the room was splashing a lot l'd start automatically doing my head shaking stim, and it was a big deal that I let it happen in that environment cuz it's my most overt stim. 

Even though I could only stay for 5 min, I'm proud that l've developed this much self awareness since my diagnosis two years ago. I even knew that when I started to do this particular verbal stim that I had reached my limit and was able to leave before getting too overwhelmed. I'm also proud that I let the big stims happen in a way that was on my terms.

Would love to hear from anyone who can relate! ";;;;
2025-10-03 05:03:21;I’m wondering;Here’s the thing, I’ve always considered myself different from everyone else, I struggle with socializing, I feel better by myself, like I don’t have the need of talking to ppl, maybe because I’ve failed so much at socializing that I’ve given up on it. I struggled with depression at my early 18s, I went to psychiatrists and therapy pretty much since then, they diagnosed me bipolar disorder II, but I’ve never really felt like I completely fit into that, because I like psychology and I’ve studied it and went over all the symptoms and stuff and it doesn’t really fit with me. I’ve always felt like I haven’t gotten the right diagnosis because I can be confusing and I get that, but since I heard about neurodivergent and have heard what ppl say they feel like, I feel like I finally fit somewhere, and I’m not gonna lie it feels so damn good. But I know I don’t have a diagnosis, and that’s what makes me doubtful. What do you recommend to do? Please and thank you. ;;;;
2025-10-03 04:38:06;The more I read, research, hear about autism and autistic people or traits;"The more my ""there's a x% chance I'm autistic"" increases but I cannot bring myself to research where I can get diagnosed from (it's super hard in my country considering we just discovered it's mental illnesses/conditions/disorders and not ghosts or revelations), how it all works, and how can I be 100% truthful and thorough (cause I'm a very confused, unsure person like if you ask me about what routines I have, I literally forget what the word ""routine"" even means) and not fake symptoms/traits one way or another (if I have that, said trait or nah), if i do have ASD then if there's a quick and easy way to unmask, and and and ARGFHHH (sorry for the shit ton of questions)

Also I 99.99% have ADHD (not diagnosed, but c'mon, just look at my post history) that I'm almost completely sure of since a lot of people in my family have atleast 2 thirds of the symptoms, so is it possible to be a 50/50er ?

2025-10-02 22:58:20;My love language is truth, but they call me rude;"I had an EEOC mediation recently for a job I was wrongfully let go from. During the session, the employer’s attorney described me as “rude.”

That hit hard because I’ve heard it before. About ten years ago, a manager at another agency said the same thing, and I pushed back.

“How am I being rude? We talk mostly over instant message. You’re reading tone into text that isn’t there. I’m literally typing these messages while smiling.”

They didn’t care and added it to my review. After that, I stayed quieter at work, afraid to speak up and be labeled rude again.

At another job, a manager asked why I was so quiet in meetings. I told her that story. She said, “If you were a white man, people wouldn’t call it rude.” Maybe she was right, maybe not, but I used that as motivation to speak up more.

Still, over the years, I kept hearing that word, at work and in my personal life. Bandmates joked that I was an “asshole.” A friend called me a “diva” because I asked for structure before joining his podcast. Other friends loved my straightforwardness and creativity, but some faded away. I started to wonder: am I rude, or just misunderstood?

My wife had been rewatching Degrassi, and I noticed a character with Asperger’s who reminded me of myself: blunt, logical, confused when others took his honesty the wrong way. So I looked up Asperger’s traits, took an online test, and scored firmly in that range. I’m not officially diagnosed yet, but it feels like the missing piece that explains decades of misfires and misunderstandings.

I realized my love language is truth. Honesty, precision, clarity. That’s how I show respect. That’s how I care. But in a world that values emotional subtext over directness, truth often gets mistaken for rudeness.

Have you ever felt like your honesty and transparency was mistaken for disrespect or being rude?";;;;
2025-10-02 22:43:09;Is it possible to have Aspergers when you seem NT for half the time and ND for the other time? Details below.;"40, F. I am basically two different people based on my level of anxiety.

**When anxious, I:**

\- talk very wooden/mechanically

\- become aware of eye contact/have to manage it during a conversation

\- have to make sure to emote correctly if required

\- try to inject tone into my speech as I know it is flat

\- have a delay/panic when I must speak - almost like 'what am I SUPPOSED to say here?' what is this person expecting?

\- am awkward and uncomfortable

\- analyse my social behaviour excessively and wonder why I always get it wrong

\- assume people are talking poorly of me



**When not anxious, I:**

\- believe I pass completely as a NT with no masking

\- talk smoothly and flawlessly - there's emotion, tone, spontaneity

\- can read people and what they expect

\- conversations are FUN and I WANT to be around people

\- can focus on a person without being distracted by others around them

\- am not 'aware' of eye contact - it's happening naturally and I'm not focussed on it

\- know people aren't talking about me because they have better things to do

  
This has been my whole life. I've maintained good relationships but I battle getting to know anyone as they may meet Ms Non-Anxious and then next week they meet my alter ego and I believe it makes them uncomfortable. 

  
I always blamed this on social anxiety, but my son has been diagnosed with Aspergers. I couldn't believe it because he always makes decent eye contact - apparently this doesn't excuse him from the diagnosis. So maybe being completely NT half the time might not excuse ME from a diagnosis? Would love your thoughts!";;;;
2025-10-02 16:20:23;why get diagnosed in adulthood?;"*THIS IS A QUESTION POSED OUT OF GENUINE CURIOSITY AND NOT INTENDED TO OFFEND ANYONE*
Hello, I am in my 20s and have had my diagnosis of ASD (at the time I was diagnosed with asperger’s) since I was around 4 years old. I struggled with my differences throughout first and secondary school and in college I continued to struggle. I am now a young adult who still has a hard time both with the fact that i have autism and the difficulties that come with being neurodivergent. 
My question is for those of you who have been diagnosed later in life, such as in adulthood. What is the reason you wanted to get diagnosed/what is the “appeal” of knowing that you are autistic? I ask because I genuinely can’t see any pros of knowing that you are autistic. As a child i wish i never knew, because it made me feel ostracized in my own mind (as well as in every other situation in my life).  As an adult, there are no benefits of diagnosis, compared to childhood where you can receive accommodations in school. I am just curious why.  This is not intended to be rude or offensive in any way, just pure curiosity for a question I have been thinking about for a long time. ";;;;

2025-10-02 11:52:18;Dismissive Avoidance, anxious attachment partner;"Tl;dr: wife tried helping our relationship by sending me some TikToks on attachment styles. The theme seemed to be that those of us who struggle to identify and communicate emotions are completely toxic, insufferable, irredeemably bad. 

Hi all. So, I (29M) got married at 21. At the time, my wife (same age) had been my best friend since middle school, and honestly the only girl ever not to find me repulsively weird and awkward. She has her own peculiarities which I don't want to delve too far into but they essentially resulted in me agreeing to do 99.9% of the ""adulting"" in our marriage. Over time, she's gotten less patient with things like my food aversion, social aversions, sensory overload, a desire for cleanliness, and I was undiagnosed until this year so these have all felt like just childish failures on my part.

This year I was diagnosed with ASD. While I'm 29 and this didn't change much of my everyday life, it enabled me to, essentially, hate myself less, as I've finally felt like all my silly little struggles were actually valid. At the same time, I've realized how many of my needs have been invalidated for 9 years of marriage. I've been more selfish with my time for the past 6 months or so, just trying to remember what I even need to be happy. I've rediscovered hobbies, actually developed a good routine, and I feel happier than I have in years. I even came off my SSRI. Unfortunately, this means that my relationship has taken a turn. From my wife's perspective, it looks like I've just spontaneously pulled away. She's confronted me about it, I usually get overwhelmed and shut down, and that makes her super angry.

This week she sent me a bunch of TikToks from psychologists about attachment styles. She acknowledges that she probably has anxious attachment problems, and that I probably have dismissive avoidance attachment. Here's my problem: all the stuff she sent me on dismissive avoidance was just totally dehumanizing. Talked about how *they* will treat you this way, *they* need to do these things to fix themselves, *they* will hurt you in these ways, etc. *They* are predictable and this is how to deal with *them.* Thousands of comments on these things about how awful *they* are as partners, how people should ""get out asap."" Then of course the content on her attachment style was all about the compassion and understanding she needs from her partner. I feel devastated and totally dehumanized. This stuff made me feel like I'm such a villian that I can't have a deep connection with anyone. It's completely torn down all the healing I've been doing. Not sure where to go from here. ";;;;
2025-10-02 08:51:08;"""Coming out"" to my dad as autistic";"I (25NB) am in the position where I feel the need to ""come out"" to my dad as autistic. Coming out may not be the right term, but as someone who has come out to my family as both bisexual and non-binary the position I am in with my autism diagnosis feels very similar to me.

For some context, my relationship with my parents has always been rocky but has gotten much better now that we live four hours apart and only see each other occasionally. After years of therapy and some time apart from them I can look back at my childhood and see that my undiagnosed autism and their approach to it was behind a lot of the issues in our family. So many of my struggles were written off as me being dramatic, or I was ""corrected"" in ways that weren't good for me long term, resulting in lots of anxiety, depression, CPTSD and a lot of mental health issues I've been unraveling since I was a teenager.

I got my autism diagnosis in October of 2024 and have been debating whether to tell them since. I don't have a solid reason as to why I need to, I just want to be my authentic self with them. My autism diagnosis has been very freeing and eye opening for me while also at times being scary during today's political climate, and I feel like they deserve to know that if they're talking down on autistic people they are also talking down on their own child. I did actually talk with my mom about it one night, and while she clearly doesn't understand what being autistic means she did a good job of listening to me and my experience. My dad is the main issue. He's a conservative, luckily not to the extent to where I am in any danger for being who I am, but to where he does drink up some of the ableist rhetoric that's been going around lately. EDIT: Hard to explain, but even though they live together I know my mom wouldn't tell my dad about my diagnosis, and if she had I would've heard it from him by now.

I used to work as an at home care taker of disabled adults, and when these subjects come up with family I am very passionate and they know where I stand. I have a lot of complicated feelings about wanting to state that I myself am autistic, especially when I know in my soul that I inherited it from my dad. I love my dad a lot and we are very similar, always have been, I don't want me telling him I'm autistic to be used as a reason to invalidate me, though. All my childhood I was told they knew better than me and only in recent years do I feel like they finally respect me as my own person. I'm afraid of losing that but also afraid to be living a lie if I were to never tell him. Part of me telling them will also involve me saying I'm in a very happy relationship with a long time friend who is also autistic, and I think they will see that as something bad as well, like I should aim for ""something better"" even though this relationship is the first one I've ever felt truly like myself in.

After struggling with numerous misdiagnoses throughout my nearly six-year psychiatric journey, I finally came face to face with my autism diagnosis. After ADHD, bipolar disorder, and many other diagnoses, I began seeing a reputable psychiatrist in my city. After a year of seeing him, he recommended some tests, and I completed them with another psychologist. A year later, I learned I was autistic.

This discovery was a huge relief because I finally had a diagnosis. None of the diagnoses I'd received before fully suited me, and I had a very hard time breaking free from depression. I endured antidepressants for years. Now, I only take the necessary antidepressants in conjunction with a diagnosis that perfectly fits me.

The problem is that the relief I experienced after the autism diagnosis, along with not fully accepting myself, made me realize all the masking I'd been doing. As my awareness grew, masking began to drain more of my energy. Therefore, avoiding most social situations felt like a solution. I run away from social situations, even if the consequences negatively impact my life. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten how to mask it. I'm afraid I'll never be able to mask it as easily in social settings again.

Last weekend, I ran into a friend and she wanted to sit down and talk. She started talking about things that had changed in her life, and I was so preoccupied with what to ask, how to respond, what facial expression to adopt, and what tone of voice to use that I couldn't even listen to what she was saying. Even a few days later, I still have trouble getting out of bed. I still haven't had the energy. I don't even have the energy to look at my phone. I just breathe and stuff things in my mouth.

Are there any girls who have experienced what I'm going through? What advice would you give me?

Note: The reason I avoid social situations isn't because I have social anxiety. It just takes me a long time to get my energy back, and that's a huge waste of time.";;;;
2025-10-02 04:50:00;"Anybody else truly feel the issues connecting with people are more a ""them"" thing than a ""us"" thing?";"I feel like I have a great grip on conversations, how to approach them, how to do them, etc. I've been in service positions for over a decade now. I can do a transactional conversation just fine, small talk just fine, would gladly talk deeper stuff if need be, and I have a few friends and family who I keep in touch with. 

It very often feels like I'm the one initiating stuff though. I rarely if ever get invites to any events from coworkers. Family meetups are more common, but still not too often. 

At work for example, we went out and did three trivia nights starting about a year ago, staggered by a few months apart each. I did a lot of the legwork for getting that off the ground. I've attempted to get meetup plans with coworkers at other jobs in the past with zero luck or interest. 

Usually with friends I'm the one saying. 
""Hey let's meet at x for dinner if you're free"". I rarely see it from the opposite end.  

I have a brother and his fiance who live 5 minutes away and all the same. It's like pulling teeth to organize a get together. I've been trying to get them out of the house for getting dinner together for the past few weeks. No luck. 

At a point, I have to tell myself that I am doing everything in my power to expand my social circle but getting no results, right? I send the invites to most things, I don't get too many from others. So how is it a social flaw on my part?

2025-10-02 01:50:27;I need help with my overthinking;"I have always had a problem with my overthinking. I have been overthinking for the past 3 years and it’s been the same thing (football tactics). It’s the same process, I find a possible answer I stick with it for about a day and then I overthink again. Does anyone have any tips or advice to help stop or lessen this?
On a side note does anyone know where the best place to gather research would be? Is it Google or ChatGPT or YouTube or a real person etc… Thank you for your time. BTW I have only recently been diagnosed so at least now I know where I can ask for help. Thanks for your time.";;;;
2025-10-01 23:44:33;I desperately want to be more social, I just don't care for conversation;"Context: I'm a mix of self diagnosed and clinically diagnosed, but unofficially. (But that's a longer story)

  
The title will probably sound like I'm an antisocial lunatic but I swear I'm not. I've ended up in my 30's with not many friends of my own. All my friends are my wifes friends that I've inherited from her.

  
I really want to make my own friends with my own interests, online or in person, but when I come to try and make friends, I just don't care about speaking to people, and I know how that sounds lol. It also just exhausts me when I think about it.

  
I'm very much a ""get to the point"" sort of person. You know when someone messages you on Teams, or Slack and they start the conversation like:  
""Hi, how are you?""  
Like, you don't care how I am. Just get to the point please.

  
I decided to task myself with actually interacting with the various Discord servers that I'm a part of, and maybe try to make an online friend. Or even start commenting on Tiktoks, Reddit, etc. But my logic always goes like this:

  
1. I liked this video/comment. I should reply!

2. What should I reply?

3. Actually, what's the point.

4. ???

5. Profit.

  
I don't know where I'm going with this, but fancied a vent.";;;;
2025-10-01 23:34:06;Would this be considered an autistic routine?;"When I looked over the autism diagnosis criteria, I saw one that said that autistic people have a strong preference for routine and become distressed when they are interrupted. I don’t consider myself as someone with a strict schedule everyday, but I was recently thinking about the past few vacations I’ve been on. 

Since childhood, I’ve been someone who prefers to sleep alone. Usually before bed, I like to watch videos or listening to music, as it’s a pretty soothing feeling. But when I go on vacation I usually share a room with at least one person. I have misophonia, so I bring a mini white noise machine with earbuds so that I can sleep better. Even though they bring me peace and help me to relax, it sometimes feels like the mere presence of the other person bothers me for some reason. Plus I rely on my white noise so much that I can’t listen to music if I want to. So even if I’m having a good time on my trip overall, I simultaneously desperately want to go back into my own bedroom. These things don’t make me visibly irritable or send me into a meltdown (they rarely ever happen), so I’m wondering if this would even be considered an autistic trait.";;;;
2025-10-01 22:18:32;Looking for resources to help close one understand;Hi, I am new to the group. I have had a recent diagnosis of auDHD. I have always been odd and was previously called out for my odd behaviour,cues and sayings, I tried controlling them and continued to mask, which ended up with me burning out and exhausting myself. I am trying to be what I am but the people around me find it difficult. They call me out for being disorganised, impulsive, withdrawn, random or having strict boundaries. I was wondering if anyone would know resources to help them understand. I would like to be who I am. All these traits of mine are somewhat harmless and I would like to be comfortable, at ease and not over analysing especially if I am around people I call friends. Thank you. ;;;;
2025-10-01 21:12:06;ASD self diagnosis + thoughts;"
I’ve talked to my therapist about this topic and I’ve gotten over this topic and then it seems like every month it haunts me again. So, to clear my brain of when moments like these happen I figured I would write on here. I am 16 years old, female. I had struggled with social awareness and cues since I was little, the same goes for sensory issues. Sensory issues are what plagued me the most as I grew up, my parents both took notice but didn’t bother going to any doctor because they figured I was just picky and that not liking certain things were normal. I also hit all my milestones so there was no “red flags”. 
After getting a therapist at age 13-14 because of chronic anxiety, learning that it was because of my separation anxiety from my mom when school started (grade 1, I didn’t go to kindergarten). I opened up about my struggles and my therapist said that she believes that I have sensory issues. This was a light bulb moment for me and my family. The flashbacks of constant meltdowns and sadness and anger for no reason was finally named. We as a family learned so much about sensory issues through this journey. 
After about a year or two I began researching about ASD and how it’s changed from what I thought it was (stereotypically). I began thinking that I might be classified as on the spectrum. So I asked my mom what she thinks of it. She at first was not so sure, because as a kid in the 80s learning about any diversity was non existent. We began to learn more about ASD and our eyes were opened again. 
It’s been a journey since then of mentioning it to my therapist and doctor, doing the CARS test and being mild to moderately autistic on the scale, and my therapist confirming that she believes I am on the spectrum. At first self diagnosing was not an issue for me, but the more people began learning about ASD and how more people were learning they were on the spectrum more people had their opinions about it. I know I shouldn’t worry about other peoples opinions to do something “right” for myself and how I live my life but, it’s still nagging me.
I am on a waiting list for CHEO for a proper diagnosis, I believe firmly that I am on the spectrum from how high my sensory issues are on the spectrum. My whole dilemma is that I didn’t realize that self diagnosing is not really valid for most people. For me, it’s 99.9% sure that I’m on the spectrum. 
Now, this is the whole reason I am writing this is because my mood swings from not caring what others think to the complete opposite. I have mood changes where I think maybe I should just ignore the whole autism thing, and be “normal” (side note: I’ve masked my whole life till a few years ago. This also makes sense considering the years before we’re like hell). Before the ASD I would just tell people (my friends wondering why I have headphones on) that I have SPD, sensory issues. 
Now, because of not having a formal diagnosis I think that maybe I should go back to just saying I have sensory issues. My mom always says that because I’m most likely level 1 the diagnosis isn’t going to be life changing, which I do think about. 
I guess what the root of the issue is that I’m having a hard time (I’m a chronic black or white thinker, either one way or the other no in between) choosing which one I should go with. I know it’s not that easy and that I should just live my life but it’s hard for me to not obsess about things that I’m not %100 sure about (ie not having it officially confirmed). But then again saying I have autism feels like home, saying I have sensory issues feels like I’m ignoring a part of myself.
So far I’m just trying to not think about it because that’s where I get hyper fixated and I really hate when I do. So for now I think I’ll just accept that I’m on the spectrum but not dwell on it so that I’m not thinking about it daily. Because it’s so exhausting.
+another topic is change and routine. Me and my family all basically dislike change (as most people do to some degree) and going through my journey of self recognition something that stood out when discussing this with my mom is that she says, yes we all dislike change but what puts you at a different level is how you react. You have meltdowns for hours and it ruins your whole day. For us, we move on, quickly. And my routine has stayed the same for years. I also firmly believe that my anxiety comes from change whether it’s because of my routine or in general (ie when I was younger and had separation anxiety). 
+ I’ve also been compared to Sheldon from the big bang theory and more recently woo young woo from attorney woo, the kdrama. When watching wyw with my mom she was amazed at how much we are similar (me and the character) this also gave me so much comfort seeing someone like myself on tv. This was before my ASD journey. 
+another mention of self diagnosis is that I believe people, more commonly diagnosed ASD people don’t like self diagnosis is because of the “trendiness” of it on social media. For example if you sleep a certain way you are neurodivergent, which is just simply untrue. I also agree with the anger people have (whether diagnosed professionally or not) because it’s almost making light of the issues people have rather than struggles. Saying that your quirkiness is something people struggle with intensely everyday, rather than saying it’s just something you do. Ie sleeping with your arms folded under your chin. ";;;;
2025-10-01 18:24:36;The Pedestal Problem: Neurodivergence, Capitalism, and Who Gets to Be a Genius?;"In the workplace, neurodivergence is often tolerated only when it’s profitable. If your “quirks” help the company innovate, you’re a visionary. If they slow down a meeting or challenge a norm, you’re a problem. That’s not inclusion—that’s conditional acceptance.

We pedestal the neurodivergent genius. The eccentric coder who pulls all-nighters and delivers brilliance. The designer who hyper focuses into a trance and emerges with a masterpiece. These people get celebrated—but only if their difference translates into output. Everyone else? They get labeled “difficult,” “unfocused,” “not a culture fit.”

And let’s name the pattern: the ones who get pedestaled are almost always white men. Einstein. Da Vinci. Tesla. Newton. Mozart. Van Gogh. Musk. Jobs. Branson. All retroactively diagnosed with traits we now associate with autism, ADHD, OCD, or other forms of neurodivergence. All celebrated for their brilliance, not pathologized for their difference. The workplace is far more likely to accommodate a socially awkward tech bro than a Black woman with ADHD who challenges authority, or a trans nonbinary analyst whose nonlinear thinking doesn’t fit the org chart.

The myth of the neurodivergent genius is racialized, gendered, and deeply capitalist. It says we don’t really accept difference—we monetize it. We tolerate neurodivergence when it’s wrapped in prestige, whiteness, and productivity. But when it shows up as emotional intensity, sensory needs, or refusal to mask? Suddenly it’s a liability.

True inclusion means dismantling the pedestal. It means recognizing that neurodivergent people don’t owe brilliance to be treated with dignity. It means making space for the messy, nonlinear, non-monetizable ways we exist. Not just the Einsteins and Musks—but the ones who stim in meetings, need written instructions, or challenge the hierarchy because their brain won’t let them play along.";;;;

2025-10-01 12:58:22;Friendship and interests;"Long story short - I'm late diagnosed. My neurotypical best friend since jr high and I have drifted apart in interests in adulthood (we've been besties since 1999). I met someone 4 years ago who I hit it off with super well and she shares similar interests and humor with me, she is definitely an aspergirl and probably adhd. I think because of this excitement and ease of conversation with her, it's made me reassess my life long friendship. I'm struggling to want to maintain my 25+ year friendship because...she bores me. I don't care about celebrities, or paint color schemes for your dining room, or makeup, or your kids GAP clothes, etc. We don't share similar interests and I just can't pretend I do. I don't know what to do here. I love her, just bored and not motivated to see her as much or talk about anything because our differences are more apparent to me lately. I don't send her much stuff I like because I know she doesn't like it and she sends the same responses over and over to it (but is kind/supportive like I am to her). Is there a way to reframe this in my head? Feeling kinda bad but also feeling like ""it is what it is"" and not sure if I can even think of this in a different way or do anything. My interests are psychology and everything nature and outdoors. Fishing, kayaking, hiking, crafting, plant and animal identification, etc. We are very different 🙁";;;;

2025-10-01 06:15:58;Neurodivergent friendly nail alternatives? Similar experiences?;"Hi,
I am diagnosed with ADHD, and GAD. I suspect maybe I am on the spectrum too because I have a lot of sensory issues but I've never really bothered to get diagnosed. 

For my entire life, I have struggled with nails. Fake nails..nail polish. A lot of it
I can't stand the feeling of the fake nails on my nails. I constantly feel them all the time when they are on. I hate that I can't scratch anything..I end up shaving the 
nails to points to scratch myself but then there is the issue of always constantly feeling them on my nails. I hate that they're so easy to break and hurt myself with. Going to the bathroom is a pain with them and sometimes painful! The grating feeling of them constantly being there and my mind constantly aware of them never goes away and drives me bonkers. 

I have the same issue with gel nail polish but it's a little more bearable. I have tried those fake nail polish packs same issue but more bearable. 

Just about the only time I have no issue is normal polish thinly coated. But this only lasts like two days as I'm an artist and work with my hands a lot. So it's not worth getting it professionally done and honestly they look awful when I paint them.

I really really love fake nails. I love how they look on me. I love everything about them. I love the cool spooky styles I can get. I want them so bad. But I. Cannot. Stand. Them. 

Anyone found any good alternatives? If not how do you get around it? ";;;;

I’ve recently quit another job at a call center after burning out in 4 months. If it’s in person, I may last 3. I am seemingly fine and then I’m not and shut down and start crying and unable to stop. I struggle with phone calls and dealing with people in general. I look up simple jobs and they make me anxious just reading them. I was only diagnosed level 1 asd, adhd, gad, and mdd a month ago. Up until this point it’s just been: get a job, struggle until I’m so depressed and anxious I quit or get fired, unemployed for several months, repeat. Eat experience carries to the next. I feel so hopeless and I just need a way to be happy and make money. I’m a huge disappointment and I feel guilty depending on my husband for the little money we have. I’ve been trying to look into other types of work I can do remote (mostly because I’m in a super small town with no jobs really). I just need something I can be left to do and not customer service.

2025-09-30 17:22:46;30 male . Do I have Autism and how should I approach parents about it ?;"Growing up, I was often teased at school for having a flat tone of voice and for speaking in a way that others described as mumbling and monotone . People would frequently ask me why I ALWAYS looked sad, even when I wasn’t feeling that way. I didn’t have many close friends just a small group and even they would sometimes make jokes about me being “slow” or “weird.” I always dismissed them and thought there’s nothing wrong with me . My mom would always complain about my posture and the way I isolate myself at times . It never occurred to me that I might be autistic until one day, a friend jokingly called me “autistic.” Although it was said as a joke, it prompted me to start researching autism. As I read more, many aspects of my life and the way people have treated me it really all started to make sense .

Social situations often make me uncomfortable, and I’ve noticed that I tend to rely on alcohol in these settings to ease the discomfort. I’m constantly worried about how I appear to others especially my facial expressions. I’ve never known how to smile naturally in photos. In my 20s, I settled on a flat, expressionless smile that I’ve stuck with ever since. I really struggle with eye contact and sometimes people might think I don’t seem interested in what they have to say cause of the way I look when listening . I’ve been told I always have a poker face . I had a habit of not brushing my teeth when I was a kid and was disorganized. 

I was bullied a lot during middle and high school. For a long time, I assumed my sad looking expression and monotone voice was a result of the bullying. But now, I wonder if I was an easy target because of undiagnosed  autism.  My dad has always treated me a different way than my younger brother . He’s always more worried about me and is always willing to help and make life easier for me . 

Given all this, I don’t even know if I should get a real diagnosis or not . ";;;;

2025-09-30 14:50:58;My psychologist told me to self diagnose myself with autism;"Hello guys!! I just got back from my psychologist appointment 

I’m being studied and medicated for ADHD currently but we’re also on the discussion of autism. 

He said he can’t exactly test me for autism because a lot of autism symptoms would be around when I was a child and with my parents and he needs to speak to them and get them to fill out questionnaires/forms in person 

(which is kind of impossible because they are on the other side of the country) 

He recommended me a few books about women with autism, he said that he honestly doesn’t think I should waste time getting diagnosis and he thinks I should just self diagnosed. 

He also said with all the time and money it would be a waste, he said I would be spending thousands of dollars for a piece of paper

He said I can still get treatment to better manage it and the more important part is to come to terms with myself and who I am. 

I kinda don’t know how to feel  because I want to be diagnosed to know I have it and understand it better 

I also don’t wanna tell people I have autism when there’s a small chance I don’t.

Everyone in my life believes I am Neurodivergent and me possibly being autistic has come up multiple times

2025-09-30 12:58:30;Is talking to yourself really that abnormal?;"I have a habit of talking to myself, and I started at mid 14, and I’m still doing it at 15. Specifically when I become a freshmen in highschool, and I’m currently a sophomore. I talk to myself a lot, in loud whispers sometimes, I like doing it a lot. I do it more at home, slightly at school, and never at soccer practice. 

I might have inattentive adhd which is worth noting, I’ve had symptoms my whole life, my mom is diagnosed with adhd, and both of my psychiatrists independently considered it. There is a small chance of anxiety or OCD, but I’m mainly suspecting inattentive adhd, with 80-90% certainty. I also had a speech delay growing up and went to speech therapy. 

Most people never really said much about it, so I never thought of it much, I even asked my dad and he said “we have a joke about it at work it’s pretty normal”. So I didn’t think much, but my mom would get pretty annoyed, but she is the type of person to get annoyed by little noises anyway. 

Until I asked her today, and she said, talking to yourself is very abnormal. I was surprised, she compared it to self harming, and even said that only homeless and crazy people do that. 

I don’t know what caused this since I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. I became an atheist at 14, lost a lot of friends at 14 due to going into highschool, I might be spending too much time on the internet, and I’m getting more responsibilities from highschool, so maybe that caused it?

I’m guessing it’s a combination of normal teenage stuff with moderate inattentive adhd, or my mom could be overreacting and it’s pretty normal.";;;;
2025-09-30 05:11:56;Neurotypical and passionate about metro maps?;"Good morning,

Just a quick question purely out of curiosity. Do you know neurotypical people who are passionate about public transportation plans (metro, tram, bus, etc.)? Because this passion is a bit of a cliché of autism. And since I was a child or a teenager (I'm 30 now) I've loved looking at these types of plans every day, for various cities, finding out about the projects. Or to imagine/draw transport plans. Even sometimes deducing them from a satellite view of a city.

I am not diagnosed with autism (I have only been wondering for a few months but I still have no certainty to this day) and if this is not the case, I am just wondering out of curiosity if there are rare neurotypicals who possibly have this passion like me (or not!).

THANKS !";;;;
2025-09-30 03:11:40;I need help and advice. I Have ASD & ADHD;"Dear all,

This will be a long one but please be patient and bare with me while i explain my history and what is going on now. I’m in the UK

I was diagnosed with Asperger’s (ASD) and learning difficulties back in the 90’s (ADD or ADHD terms didn’t exist then) but do i believe i have ADHD. 

I have been on the NHS waiting list for ADHD so i can be seen to have an assessment to be diagnosed for ADHD. 

But throughout my life i have struggled with everything. To learn things, to concentrate, to retain information (my short term memory is bad but my long term memory is good) I didn’t do well in primary and secondary school… i was placed in bottom sets for english and maths. 

I am an intelligent person, i’m knowledgable in many areas and many subjects… But the thing is i was bullied a lot when i was a kid… I did not have many friends… even could not get a lasting relationship with a woman in my life. I’m quite a sociable person but i just don’t know why i am not liked by people… Im always quite down because my ASD and suspected ADHD let me down… i’m depressed and have lack of self esteem and confidence… i’ve just always been like this? Maybe i have a chemical imbalance in my brain… maybe a lack of dopamine or other important chemicals in the brain? 

But getting to my main point…. I went to college and got qualifications in Electronics and IT. Then on to university and got my IT related degree. 

I started my IT career in 2011 and it’s been a rocky career for me…  I work in IT Support and i have knowledge in many areas in IT. But due to my ASD and suspected ADHD i have been mistreated in my previous jobs… some jobs i had over the years i had understanding and supportive managers.. then in other jobs i had not very good managers and they sacked me before or by the time my probation is up. 

In one job over the years, i was working for a multinational company for 5 years. I did very well for myself and i had an understanding boss, he gave me a real chance! But in my previous jobs i have not been lucky. 

I am in a job now where history is repeating itself in my earlier jobs.. My boss thinks i dunno what I’m doing and im doing my best to adapt to how the IT processes and infrastructure work…  yes, of course i’m doing my best! But the processes and infrastructure are not perfect at all.. But it takes me longer to learn things compared to other people. Yes, i did inform my boss and HR i have ASD and suspected ADHD, and i stated what reasonable adjustments were needed. but it took me a while to state what they were .. he was not happy about it but i was busy trying to ‘learn the ropes’ in my job. 

I just dunno what to do… i can’t afford to lose this job.. it was ruin my career and won’t look good on my CV. and no before anyone asks, i will not change my career.. i also do part time courier parcel deliveries at the weekends and i struggle with that because I’m sent to areas i don’t know to deliver parcels and that causes me heightened anxiety and other issues like my memory. No matter what job i’ll do in life…i will struggle. But i love IT and its my career. it’s what i want to do 

For example… if i wanted to find another job while i am at this job right now… i need to find a IT Support role where the company is ‘neurodivergent friendly’ or ‘understanding’ and i looked everywhere… i can’t seem to find jobs like this… or they are far few inbetween… (do they exist?) plus organisations like the ‘national autistic society’ and other similar organisations seem unhelpful and useless to help me… 

Can anyone, and i mean anyone advise me what to do or where i can get help OR find a IT Support Job where i will be treated decently and given a chance? 

My mental health has taken a nosedive because of this… and yes i’ve been given anti depressants and counselling in the past. They did not work! Plus i’ve been feeling really down. I even tried to get myself higher up the waiting list for the ADHD assessment… with evidence it is affecting my mental health… But it did not work despite the evidence…  

The thing is… even if i have been officially diagnosed with ADHD, will the meds help me? how will it be determined which ADHD meds will help me? 

But as we know… there is no medication to help with ASD… unfortunately… 

anyway… i’m sorry if this is very long… But i hope to get the advice i need. Thank you for reading.. ";;;;
2025-09-29 19:32:49;any black women/girls in here struggling to get assessed?;"i’m 13 turning 14 in a month!

my mom described her assessment like it was a walk in the park. she has ADHD and was diagnosed somehow immediately because her teachers picked it up. however i think i have high-functioning autism.

im literally fighting to get assessed. i have to remind my mom to call the hospital every day because the doctor who did my check up forgot to schedule my psych evaluation, and he doesn’t have a direct e-mail. 

i know that i might have autism because everyone in both my newly formed friend group and everyone in my close friend group is Audhd or autistic. they are all diagnosed except for little ol me over here. i originally thought nothing of it and thought i was neurotypical until my best friend, who’s Audhd picked up on it. both my best friends (Audhd and Autism, black AFAB people) were assessed late.

but yeah i’m just fighting. 

any tips to keep my sanity?";;;;
2025-09-29 15:38:47;Disability;I personally describe myself as disabled (AuDHD official diagnosis), even though the state denies me the official label and monetary help. I’ve applied three times and been denied. I haven’t held long-term work for over 15 years. I feel like professionals believe I’m just manipulating people in my life to care for me, though. I’m very good at masking, but I have terrible skills when it comes to following directions. I get panic attacks and have meltdowns. I’ve really tried, and I’ve not been able to support myself. I do believe I meet ADA definition of disability in the US even without the official label by the state disability services. Do any of you deal with feeling like you’re on the fringes but still qualify for disability? Could I hear stories either of success or failure at getting benefits? I’m struggling here. I have a husband who takes care of me, but we’d benefit so much from the monthly disability payments here in the US.;;;;
2025-09-29 12:47:18;Can I get advice on what support label to use?;"So for context I was self diagnosed and then medically diagnosed at 16. I asked what level of autism I was and I was told that it would fluctuate between level 1 and 2. I’m asking about the autisic communties definition of LSN/MSN/HSN not the actual levels 

I struggle with these things

Showering
•	⁠consistently doing other basic hygiene tasks
•	⁠cooking safely (I usually can make the same meals consistently over and over again, but if I learn something new I have a million questions and i accidentally burn myself often. I also can’t always tell when meat is properly cooked. Overall not safe and able to do it on my own)
•	⁠certian chores
•	⁠social situations, I cannot keep realtionships
•	⁠I’m somewhat visibly autisic as I get harrased about it in public but others dismiss me and say I don’t look autisic
•	⁠having enough energy for work
•	⁠I literally live in a transitional group home
•	⁠idk if I can live alone
•	⁠my meltdowns have been debilitating and violent, causing me to get expelled previously and troubles with the police. No longer happens anymore tho!!
•	⁠strong academic support. Like cannot do math on my own past basic stuff that I need for like grocery shopping and stuff. Which is tough cause I’m trying to get a masters psych degree and need some college level math
•	⁠some minor speech issues
•	⁠major tech issues. I didn’t have access to my own medical records due to my lack of tech knowledge until this year. And I’m 18!
•	⁠really bad skin picking stim to the point of it being a disorder that’s been diagnosed
- pretty debilitating food sensory issues- will regularly vomit or starve to advoid food due to the texture. My diet is garbage

Things I’m alright at

- being organized and on top of things
•	⁠once I’m actually at work I thrive
•	⁠I excel in some subjects
•	⁠I do have a partner that is also on the spectrum that we’ve been dating for over a year and have lived together and that’s been good.
•	⁠I can live on my own if I have my partner as a support for things like hygiene (prompts, helping out, etc)
•	⁠I can drive (not great though, I have gotten violations and my poor car is in distress) 
•	⁠I’m ok at managing my finances (in the sense that I shouldn’t spend much money cause I don’t have much money and should just try and save up and only spend the bare minimum for food and stuff)
•	⁠I can still verbalize like 90% of the time even if it’s a stuttery and stuff
•	⁠advocating for myself. I’ve navigated my 504 for example pretty well!
•	⁠i understand my medical stuff and can consent to it without help. I might be scared and need emotional support but I think that’s normal tbh

I will say I have multiple chronic illnesses, ADHD, a very very very mild TBI, ptsd, and a potential dissacotive disorder. So like the showering thing is heavily impacted by how much energy I have physically. But there’s still times where I’ll have all of the physical and mental accommodations I need and I still can’t do it on my own even with good energy levels.

Idk I don’t want to use the wrong labels and hurt the moderate to high support needs community but I really don’t relate to level 1/ LSN autisics either so some input would be good! Thank you^

Edit: I meant to talk about LSN/MSN/HSN and I realize now that it definitely came across as actual diagnosed medical labels when that’s not what I’m asking for. I’m sorry for making this post confusing ";;;;

My wife is Autistic and has  ADHD, professionally diagnosed, not a personal diagnosis. I love this person very much and want to continue our relationship but I'm not sure how I'll react in person. I don't want to have an argument but my wife comes first.  Any suggestions are apricated, this feels like someone died and I have to dig the grave.

I do have trouble with reading when I see a word and sees something completely different sometimes.

For suspecting autism, I'm really just thinking I'm not likely autistic as much as I did a bit ago.

2025-09-29 08:58:58;Question for People Diagnosed as an Adult;"Hello everyone. I have a lot of traits that are autistic in nature. I have no formal diagnosis, but have brought this up with my psychiatrist. I have been told that it's hard to get diagnosed as an adult. My psych asked me what a diagnosis would do for me and I couldn't give her an answer. So, my question for those of you diagnosed as an adult, what did getting an official diagnosis do for you?

  
ETA: Thank you for all the comments. I am in the US. My psych did ask out of genuine curiosity, she was not passive aggressive. I've been seeing her for a decade due to other mental health issues.";;;;
2025-09-29 07:35:41;Emotional attachment to women from challenging backgrounds?;"Hi,

I just wanted to share a personal perspective on something and ask if anyone has felt similar. I'm an autistic man in my late twenties, I was diagnosed at 4 and went to a special school so I guess my profile is level 2 support needs, moderate masking (I have managed to work jobs, go to university, and live independently, albeit inconsistently and with some support needs and mental health problems, but I don't manage neurotypical social settings like parties and struggle immensely in loud and crowded environments). I've never been in a serious relationship, but want to start meeting people and going on dates.

I've noticed over the years that I tend to have feelings for women who ""trauma-dump,"" and have generally lived quite challenging lives from disadvantaged backgrounds. I have had good friendships with these people, but it's never turned into a serious relationship with cohabiting. I don't really know why this is exactly, but I have a few theories:

- I admire their resilience and strength with all they've been through, and find I connect emotionally if they share things with me, and I always feel there's mutual compassion and kindness in these friendships.

- I feel like I have the emotional intelligence and patience to be really nurturing and good to them, to really understand their needs and best interests.

and

- I feel like they will learn to have the same patience with me that I really need to navigate my sensory issues, emotional regulation/space and alone time needs in a relationship, since they know what it feels like to not have an easy life.

I know this can be a bit of a slippery slope for various reasons, and I do think I know how to spot the red flags, but I just wanted to ask if I'm alone or unusual in forming connections like this?";;;;
2025-09-29 02:52:00;What am i able to call myself? or am i fake? or am i valid????;"i wanted to come here to talk openly about this because i want full self awareness. I want accountability and i hate people that actively and knowingly fake disorders/disablilities

what i do definitely have (diagnosed)
i was diagnosed professionally with adhd, depression, anxiety and a few other things but my mom has the diagnosis sheet and hasn't had me read it yet (i've asked her so many times and she's like ""oh ill get it to you tonight"" and never does it's really annoying) i am also paralyzed below the knees. anywho im like almost 90% sure i have autism and not adhd(or both).  i've done research and i can understand that almost all the traits overlap, but i seriously have all the shared traits, and a lot of the autism specific traits. and i haven't even gotten the chance to look at the sheet so i dont even know for sure if i wasnt diagnosed with it. my mom hates the idea of me having autism. before i was tested, i still wore soundproof headphones in public and get shutdowns, and extreme attachments, sensory overload, and VERY strict food sensitivity i can't eat something like rice if the ingredients aren't the same size and texture or i will cry. My mom got super upset about me wearing headphones in public because 'i don't need them since im not autistic'(autism or not i can have accommodating headphones, no?). and yeah, some of those overlap with (i think) adhd but its to the point where its intensity just makes me question things. i also have a hard time understanding certain social rules. like why is it that when i ask a question about a plan or rule or anything, i get in trouble for ""arguing""??! like this didn't happen but its an example of what does happen, my mom might say i have to eat the food in front of me (ill die it's chili and chilli is my enemy) but my brother is still hungry and wants my plate, and we have other food i could eat. and when i ask she would be like ""stop arguing"". She also doesn't think i have those issues bc i've learned to just bite my tongue and stay confused instead of asking unnecessary questions. Even if im trying to help, like if my family is planing something and i say ""well what if we did this instead?"" i don't understand at all why that's rude!!? don't even get me started on ragebaiting/sarcasm..

anyways getting rlly off track here. i was just wondering if my questions are valid or if it's valid to call myself autistic or if not i wont, im just confused on how i should approach it.";;;;
2025-09-28 22:49:19;Why I Advise Against Disclosing Neurodivergence at Work — Please Read Before You Do;"EDIT: I am a management consultant on a grad scheme. Previously, I was a law grad with a Magic Circle firm. I had performance problems ... one of them being the fact i took too long to draft documents compared to my peers. the firm claimed it was cos i was lazy, when i worked 10hr  days alongside everyone else. i could have taken it to employment tribunal but i dont want my name and workplace drama to be publicised online where the next employer can find it. 

 I have autism, adhd and dyspraxia, which is why I use chatgpt for this. In the work I am being paid to perform, I am not allowed to use chatgpt so I won't use it for that. This is an unpaid hobby for me, why wouldn't i use chatgpt to make my life easier.



I recently published a deeper piece on Medium, [*Why I Don’t Recommend Disclosing Neurodivergence at Work*](https://atypally.medium.com/why-i-dont-recommend-disclosing-neurodivergence-at-work-adebb206ec80?sk=6c33f5b59c8707f9c3fcccd612756ac5), but I want to share a distilled, conversational version here — one that I hope sparks honest discussion.

# 🔍 The Heart of the Argument

Simply put: **disclosure is risky** — not because of big, obvious discrimination, but because of the small, creeping ways bias shifts how you’re perceived.

When I told my manager I was neurodivergent, nothing about my work changed. But the interpretation of my communication style did. Behaviors that used to be praised in peers (especially male peers) started being framed as “symptoms” or deficits. That’s not just misinterpretation — it’s a shift in the lens through which your work is seen.

# The Subtle Costs

* You might be excluded from “high-visibility” projects.
* Your style might be scrutinised more than others’ — even if your output is the same.
* There’s a danger of being *boxed in* — cast as *the neurodivergent person*, rather than someone whose performance stands on its own.

Disclosure doesn’t just change how others view *your diagnosis* — it changes how they view *you*.

# When Disclosure Makes Sense (Yes, Sometimes It Does)

I’m not saying disclosure is always bad. Sometimes it’s necessary — for accommodations or for safety. But before you decide, ask:

* **What’s the culture like?**
* **Is your manager open and flexible (really)?**
* **Could disclosure limit your mobility or how your work is seen?**

If you can get by without it — by choosing your battles and advocating for inclusion more broadly — that’s often safer.

# What We Should Do Instead

We need workplaces where neurodivergence doesn’t have to be disclosed to be accommodated. That means:

* Universal design: flexible work, clear expectations, sensory considerations built in.
* Manager training: making implicit bias visible and no longer acceptable.
* Valuing diversity in communication and working styles — not just “neurotypical norms.”

You shouldn’t have to *risk your career* to ask for basic respect and accommodations.

Let me know your thoughts:

* Someone who has disclosed — how did it go, good or bad?
* People who chose not to — do you regret it, or do you think it was wise?
* What should workplaces do to make disclosure safe (or unnecessary)?";;;;
2025-09-28 20:55:22;ADHD/Autism and childhood trauma/having shit parents;"I am in several subreddits, follow various social media pages about trauma, healing from trauma, recovering from narcissistic parents, etc and almost every time people will mention their ADHD and autism as well. Sometimes, PMDD for women. Can we talk about this? Anyone figured out how/why?

2025-09-28 13:35:21;Meltdowns & shutdowns;"Hi there! recently diagnosed with autism. For a long time, I didn't think I had autism in part because I didn't think I had meltdowns. But I only had a concept of what meltdowns looked like for children. 

I talked to a psychologist and realized I definitely lean more towards shutdowns, maybe partly due to being late diagnosed, I shut myself in my room and implode. This looks like pulling my hair, rocking, dissociating, not talking for hours, and racing thoughts.

When  I do have a meltdown, it looks like this: I can't talk except for repeating the same phrases over and over (I have to get out of here, I want to go home, my stomach hurts, I want my mom) (even if I'm already at home), sometimes I hit my head, sometimes I tear at my clothes, I'm crying and rocking. My frontal lobe of my brain is turned off and I cannot make decisions or answer questions. But only my partner and maybe one or two close friends have seen me like this. I have been able to squish my feelings down for a couple minutes until I can find a nearby bathroom or can get home from being in public; but the longer I hold it down the worse it is later. 

So if you're an adult, especially late diagnosed, what do meltdowns or shutdowns look like for you? Thanks so much in advance for sharing, I know it's a pretty vulnerable topic.  ";;;;
2025-09-28 08:16:59;Over stimulation advice!;"Hello everyone, I just wanna start off by saying I don’t have a diagnosis and I’m fairly new to it but my closest friends who are neurodivergent have told me about their suspicions I also have traits. 

But in this post I wanted to ask anyone for their advice on over stimulation. It seems the more I naturally give attention to it the more prominent it actually is. And I’m wondering if I have just suppressed this so much over the years cos it’s never really been a problem before. 

I’m also quite a spiritual person and this is where the confusion comes in because I love meditating and it seems the more I’ve gotten into meditating (coincidentally the same time I’ve started to question if I’m potentially neurodiverse) the more I’ve realised how over stimulating normal everyday life is to the point where it makes me wanna just meditate all day.

Apologies for the big text but if you have any tips or advice or guidance it would be greatly appreciated :)";;;;
2025-09-28 06:28:44;Hit head due to noise sensitivity;"Full disclosure, I (30F) am not diagnosed. I do not know if I have some kind of neurodivergence but what I do know is my sensitivity to noise has always been an issue, and I know that this is sometimes an issue for neurodivergent people so I am hoping this may resonate with someone on this thread. 

I live in a apartment block. My next door neighbours have a very large television and speakers. I have had to knock on their door before when it has gotten too loud. I realise this is an annoying thing for most people but my partner can get on with their day, I cannot. 

Today, I had what I can only describe as a complete meltdown (I'm sorry, I know that word has  a specific meaning amongst autistic people but it is genuinely the only way I can describe what happened to me). The noise from next door had permeated through three walls into the bedroom, I had to have my nose cancelling headphones on full to drown it out and I was absolutely utterly sick of dealing with noise. The noise from my headphones had become too loud and the earphones were hurting my ears by this stage. My loop earplugs wouldn't have drowned out the noise from next door and at that stage I just didn't want any earplugs or headphones anymore, my head and ears were sore from them. I went into the kitchen and just roared at the top of my lungs before dropping to the floor, attempting to hit my head off the ground, my partner held me but then I still managed to hit my head twice off the skirting board and then I just had to stay curled up in a ball crying with my fingers in my ears. When the noise gets like this it feels like someone is constantly drilling inside my brain and I just want to rip my skin off. 

I can't control what people do during the day, but I just personally do not understand how someone in a shared space (the shared space being an apartment block) could think that that's an ok volume to listen to stuff all day. I just have to accept what people get to be as loud as they want all.the.time but people can't accept that I want quiet (or just not stupidly loud) sometimes? I don't know why the former wins out. 

Anyway, I don't know if anyone has ways to deal with noise when your noise cancelling headphones and loop earplugs can't even save you anymore. I've always been distressed/sensitive about noise ever since I was a could but I have *never* reacted to the extent I did today. ";;;;
2025-09-28 05:20:48;The Ever-Lovely Hank Green has done a deep dive into the *actual data* behind the Trump Administration's recent ASD increase claims, revealing the BS.;"If you're unfamiliar with Hank Green, he's a YouTube science educator and all-around great person. He talks about all sorts of things, with a heavy emphasis on data-driven info and breaking through the rhetoric; his channel is definitely worth a scroll if you're a fan of random info and good-natured discussion.

He released this video today after being unable to tear himself away from getting to the bottom of the recent Trump & RFK Jr. announcement (now famous for the Tylenol tirade), and he went first to the reports, then to the studies the reports were based off to see if he could find data that backed up what was being claimed.

He goes over it in detail during the video, but the TLDR is that current data shows several factors - some known, some probable, and some unknown - have led to the increase of ASD diagnosis in the US; but that the conclusion reached by the Trump Administration and his Dept. of Health and Human Services is only possible by a gross manipulation, by way of only using selective data to force a red herring.

2025-09-27 11:20:59;Autistic mom of autistic daughter fighting autistic wife on behalf of daughter - help;Context: I have been diagnosed for a year, I’ve known or suspected I was autistic for 2 years. My daughter is autistic and 9 years old. She has very predictable overstimulation meltdowns that are very treatable with ending the stimulation, body pressure, snacks and tablet. In that order if it’s full meltdown. Yes it’s loud, yes it’s overwhelming but I’ve been her mom got her whole life and her meltdowns used to last hours before we got it down to a science. So now…I’ve been fighting w my wife who I have been with only for 2 years (my daughters now step mother) and we’ve basically strongly disagreed about how to handle her meltdowns for the entire time we’ve been together. Now that she’s taken a much bigger role in the girls lives since I work much more and she’s taken a stay at home role she feels she has more say. She herself has not been diagnosed formally but about a year ago she strongly suspected she was autistic as well. She has not done her work around internalized ablism and I feel that she’s projecting it onto Michelle. That brings us to today. My daughter got spacers so that she can get braces next week. These are painful the first day and then she went to school. When she got home she kept snapping and crying at everything. This is totally expectable as far as I’m concerned for any kid much less an autistic one. The afternoon ended in a full meltdown which triggered deep overstimulation for me. I was about to snap and my wife told me she had it from here so I gladly went downstairs to remove myself from the screaming and regulate myself first. When my daughter was still screaming a full ten min later I went upstairs and my wife was on the other side of the room not even trying to help her regulate. I of course did our protocol plus bouncing/swaying when it’s really bad and she calmed down after a while. Now the question, my wife thinks my daughter is a brat. She really believes she is helping her by letting her “cry it out” and “not always get her way”. I don’t know how to talk to her about this anymore. She is a woman of color and one of 7 kids. She has it deeply trained into her to be “considerate of others” and is trying to “teach” my daughter this. But it strikes me as SO harmful and full  of AFAB masking and ablism. What should I do?!;;;;
2025-09-27 11:04:05;hyperfix genuinely making me feel sick?;"Basically the title lol. I have diagnosed ADHD and my hyperfixations are always HUGE forms of escapism for me. Like to the point where if I think about whatever my favorite thing my be at the moment too hard, I'll get *genuinely* upset that I'm not in that world. I'll imagine myself as a character in the main cast, what I'd be doing during each episode or movie. I even often imagine it the other way around, with the characters being in *my* daily life, or some kind of mix? Like I'll be making dinner in the kitchen, and start talking out loud to the characters as if I was making dinner in *their* kitchen, and essentially LARPing like I'm part of their lives, or I'll be doing schoolwork and mumble to myself like I'm having a conversation with one of my favorite characters whose sitting next o be helping me do math.   
  
when I'm really into something (like I am now with a show), I talk about them constantly to friends, I'll consume the media whenever I possible can, I'll imagine them in every part of my life, and myself in every part of theirs. And usually its just something fun to daydream about, but eventually it tips over and I get *genuinely* upset at it not being the reality. it makes me so actually sick and upset that I can't be in their world interacting with them. It feels like i'm. stuck here? It feels like I'm missing out on something intrinsic to my soul. I just feel this immense *loss.*

this also happens with shows that have particularly upsetting endings. like if I'm really attached to a character and they die, something about me takes it so hard it feels like theres this whole in my chest. it feels like im grieving them as if they were real, and i never handle it well. if i know a character dies later in a show im watching, ill put off whatever that episode or as long as i can. ill interact with bits of the fandom, forever avoiding that characters death until i cant anymore.   
  
and i usually always have a relationship, canon or otherwise, that *completely and utterly* consumes me. ill consume everything i possibly can about them, even sometimes my personality ever so slightly shifts to them. im always thinking about them in my daily life. and its absolutely *awful* whenever one of them dies. like for instance the current show im into, one of them literally bleeds out in the others arms, and ever since i learned about it, it makes me physically nauseous thinking about his death. the two of them are so utterly tragic that it upsets me to my core to think about.

anyway, i know this is just me taking media FAR to seriously, but mostly why im telling all of this is i wanna know what to do? i wanna keep enjoying media, but whenever its anything short of a complete comedy, anything vaguely tragic that happens to the characters upsets me on such a deep level that i *know* isnt normal. i dont wanna keep feeling like this. i wanna be able to watch a show without feeling like my a piece of myself is missing just because im *here* and not with them. or be able to watch a character die or be upset without it feeling like its happening to me too. anytime anything remotely upsetting happens for dramatic effect, it upsets me to my *core.*

2025-09-27 07:42:20;how to get my mum to believe i'm autistic?;"i'm midway through my autism (and adhd) assessment and i just learned from my dad that my mum has never even believed i'm autistic despite me thinking she supported me and it's really upsetting. i've told her i'm sure i'm autistic for years, explained all the traits i experience to her many times, had many people including teachers and medical professionals tell her and me they think it's very likely i'm autistic and she doesn't even believe me. everytime i try and even mention autism she gets so frustrated and annoyed with me and just tells me to be more positive and not ""put myself down"". hopefully getting an actual diagnosis will help, but is there any way to get her to actually believe me? she's said she thinks she has adhd before (undiagnosed) so i'm not sure why she just won't believe that i could be neurodivergent. ";;;;
2025-09-27 02:31:48;ADHD is not treated seriously;"I feel like so many people undermine ADHD as ""not an actual problem/disability"" because it's (in my opinion) underrepresented in media or represented incorrectly. It's often looked at like something that gives ""flavor"" to your personality. Even my friends had a bit... weird approach to me getting an ADHD diagnosis, because, and I quote: ""You don't act like a person with ADHD would."". When I asked them how in their opinion a person with ADHD would act, they just responded: ""I don't know but not like you."". It's just so tiring.";;;;
2025-09-26 23:06:58;Do any of you feel ill or slightly off most of the time?;"Often at the weekend, I’ll aim to do something I enjoy, like reading a few newspaper articles. But I can’t just do it - it’s like I have to fight by body and mind in order to enjoy myself.

The only thing that seems to fix it somewhat is cardio. Sometimes I’ll do a short intense session and feel much better, and other times I will go on a long walk. And I mean looong. Some days, if I’m off work, I walk around aimlessly for 8 hours or more to “wake myself up”. 

I have an ADHD diagnosis, and yeah, sometimes I feel like I have a huge surplus of energy and I get myself into trouble.

But most of the time, I feel lethargic and foggy. It’s like I see the world through a thick haze. It’s an incredibly uncomfortable feeling. I am at work today but I have spent most of the day staring into space. Episodically, I might cry because I just want to do my job and I’m scared of being fired.

Have any of you experienced anything like this?

I’m not sure if I’ve been this way my whole life. I’ve definitely felt like this since my early teens.";;;;
2025-09-26 08:18:58;Question about situational mutism;"Hi everyone- 

I’m the parent of an Autistic teenager who was initially diagnosed with situational mutism. We tried desensitization treatments before knowing she was also Autistic. Now that we have that information, we are questioning the best way to help her with the SM. I was wondering if anyone who has/had SM could share their experience with any treatments, and if you found them at all helpful- or if we should stick to just supporting her with alternative communication tools. She tells us she does much better when we support her, but isn’t sure herself if encouraging speaking is too much. In the past, we would have her whisper to us her order at a restaurant, then she would gradually say it louder and louder over several months; then she could order or engage independently. This only helped in some very specific situations, but didn’t transfer globally. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated! ";;;;
2025-09-26 06:57:51;Non-passionate obsessions. ADHD or OCD?;"Obsessive researching: 

Sometimes, I research something for crazy amount of time, but I may NOT enjoy it. For example before my ADHD diagnosis I researched ADHD like crazy for night and day for everday during a year. I was getting so tired, my brain fried. I research every symptom separately, one by one, ask specific questions, I HAVE TO get detailed right answers from RIGHT people so I even check if people that give me information are at least diagnosed themselves. If not I try to reach correct audience unless I get a right answer. Now I accidentally know a lot about mental disorders even unknown ones for a non psychiatrist 19 year old. I do love talking about these though.

When drawing: 

Research aside, drawing for me was 100% passion. Now, that I've started studying anatomy, proportions, whenever I start drawing seriously instead of just sketching mentally CAN'T draw if I'm not drawing PERFECTLY. If I notice flaws I start practicing it. I can't accept it. This somewhat sounds like an advantage but it makes everything unenjoyable. This mentality restricts me in practicing too, I was challanging myself if I could draw without ereaser which I knew was a bad way to learn but my brain wanted to prove I could, otherwise I thought I wasn't talented enough. Rationally, I still know I'm good at drawing.


Questioning my abilities:

Sometimes I question my intelligence and create questions to myself to later solve it ""logically"". Same with creativity, I try to be original, I try to think of something original, if I do, then I have impostor syndrome and think that I got lucky or I tried too hard and I'm not creative, if fail to think of anything I think I'm uncretative. Then I have counter arguments to myself what if I'm not thinking naturally due to this overthinking? And basically I analyze my whole brain process and debade with myself.


Also body Dysphoria because of this, but I know I got a decent face. I'm diagnosed ADHD, not OCD. Is this because of ADHD's hyperfocus or can it be OCD?

2025-09-26 05:10:18;Anyone else whose symptoms were completely ignored as a kid even though the signs were RIGHT there?;"I feel like my parents were just completely oblivious of my symptoms when I was a kid, and yet they were SO obvious. I can remember as young as 5 having ND symptoms. Throughout my entire childhood I was always viewed as really weird and crazy because I was very different from other kids. It actually makes me so mad because I feel like if they had realized sooner and I had the support I needed, I wouldn't have developed all of these issues I currently have from the consequences of being untreated. Now I'm super temperamental and have severe emotional dysregulations/mood swings, severe depressive episodes and burn out, and me developing PTSD at 12 from trauma has only made the symptoms worse.

To add on, my dad has (diagnosed) ADHD, so to him, my behaviors weren't anything abnormal and just saw it as me ""inheriting his own 'quirks'"". But the thing is that he knew he has ADHD, so I don't know how he didn't ever notice my symptoms that were almost EXACTLY like his. My mom, however, is neurotypical, so I don't understand how she noticed my little brother's symptoms immediately but never noticed mine. It took me having to figure it out all on my own to finally understand what's ""wrong"" with me.

Seriously, it's actually insane to me that my parents had never ONCE thought that me stimming-ly flapping my hands, sucking on my arms so much that I'd have hickeys all over them, being obsessed with spinning around, always fidgeting non-stop, being extremely forgetful and always losing everything, struggling to focus in school because of daydreaming, being so hyperfocused and so intensely detail-oriented in my special hobbies and interests or hyperfixations, being very easily triggered by certain sounds to the point that it would make me rage and cry, and having such terrible sensory issues that I'd have meltdowns over the texture of my clothes or hair wasn't normal. The signs were all SO OBVIOUS!!! (╬▔皿▔)╯";;;;

2025-09-25 23:10:33;Autism behavior(s) or ADHD ones?;"To preface I have been diagnosed with ADHD, but not with ASD. However, my family 
, particularly my mom, seems pretty adamate I have autism as well. 

So here’s a rundown of behaviors I’m not sure are autistic, ADHD, and or anxiety/ social anxiety. 

1. Hyperactive/excessive/maladaptive daydreaming characterized with pacing, hand flapping, object twirling, and occasionally vocal “stims”. 

I always had a incredibly well developed imagination and a need to make it make sense. In my imagination things have to fit together with traits of myself or even superficial things like my zodiac sign or “spirit animal”. On that last bit, I have a pathological need to catagotize myself to make sense of certain aspects of my personality. I tend to flip flop with labels a lot as well thinking at times my spirit animal is a snake and then a owl, oh but it has to fit with my zodiac sign for some arbitrary reason :p

2. Feeling the need to clarify my intentions/social behavior.

It’s not that I don’t understand others behavior or I can’t put myself in their shoes, but rather I know there are multiple ways my own behavior and statements can be interpreted especially on text. Therefore, I feel the need to clarify myself a lot and make what I mean absolutely clear. The best way I’d describe this is my brain assumes the people around me and incapable of interpreting me correctly. I also call this the “I assume everyone around me has autism” xD 

3. A need for perfection especially in toys or figures. 

As a kid I specifically wanted my toys to be perfect without any model errors or paint mistakes. It’s kinda inexplicable to me the reason behind this, but I do that I could get over it if I could correct the “mistake” myself or justify it with some arbitrary reason. For example I had a dinosaur toy with a slightly off color tail that gave it a brownish hue, I got over that by saying “oh in the lore the character had its tail burned”. 

4. Highly lexile/literate from a young age and in my free time preferred to read/draw than talk with other kids.

This definitely became more prominent after I moved at age 11 as before that I was pretty social with the small group of friends I had. That being said I would often fail to initiate social behavior and usually waited for others to reach out to me. 

Could these traits be the result of ADHD and anxiety alone or am I looking at being a triple threat here? 

tldr: 

1. Hyperactive/excessive/maladaptive daydreaming characterized with pacing, hand flapping, object twirling, and occasionally vocal “stims”. 

2. Feeling the need to clarify my intentions/social behavior.

3. A need for perfection especially in toys or figures. 

4. Highly lexile/literate from a young age and in my free time preferred to read/draw than talk with other kids.

2025-09-25 15:43:27;Imposter syndrome;"For context I'm an aspie (diagnosed) with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.

My whole life I've been told ""you won't eat ? Lucky you"" or ""you had a convulsive seizure this weekend ? Sucks"" ""the stress of your school is too much and you're always sick because of it ? You're just lazy"" and whatever. I always think I make up what I feel like because I'm lazy, or maybe I'm trying to be interesting by being sick. So I don't really know if it's ever ok to tell the doctors since I always wonder: ""are they gonna see anything that's wrong ?"" ""Am I really feeling that way ?"" (last time the doctor said my eyes were fine and I ""just"" needed to change my glasses, I got a MAJOR change of correction, so I bought glasses (sooooooo expensive), I couldn't see anything with them. Thankfully I kept the old ones. I was diagnosed with MS a month later.

Do you also have this ""what I think I feel is not true"" thought that creeps in your head ? Like the bad days are just your imagination ? I know there's imposter's syndrome, but I alway think ""not me, I might just be an actual imposter"" (the irony). I'm gonna drink a protein milkshake and play ""Against the storm"" now. Special interests always help.";;;;
2025-09-25 09:12:41;Struggling with life skills;I am very bad with budgeting, cooking, general life skills as someone diagnosed AuDHD. I’m fairly able to mask, though, so people don’t see me as really disabled when I am. I struggle so much with even approaching the issue to learn new skills. I feel like I was stunted a bit by being over-accommodated by my parents growing up (I never had to cook for myself). I worry that even though my husband says he’s ok with me as I am that I take advantage of him and people from the outside looking in would say it is an unhealthy dynamic. I’m not currently working, but I do feel like that is due to my true disability. I just wonder if others here struggle with similar things. The mixed feelings. The worry that others would call aspects of my disability “red flags” to be avoided. I’ve even had another autistic friend literally tell me, “you should have some skills!” It really stung and made me self-conscious.;;;;
2025-09-25 03:48:30;My PIP got declined for masking?;"I’m not sure if this is a question or a rant. Any advice would be amazing.

Recently I have had a massive flair up of endometriosis and POTS, leading to me being signed off work since April, advised not to drive, and unable to leave the house without a wheelchair due to pain (and/or dizziness, fainting spells). 
As part of my myriad of physical symptoms, I have daily pain, struggle to get to/from the bathroom, needs meals cooked for me, can’t stand in the shower, can rarely clean myself, and rarely leave the house.

This is combined with my pre-existing neurodivergent symptoms - I’m diagnosed with ADHD and waiting for my ASD assessment. I have all the fun symptoms that come with these conditions, and live with unmedicated ADHD as I am in England and have to wait for any help there. 

Here’s the shit bit - because I have been away from work now for nearly 6 months, I’ve been on SSP (UK sick pay - £475 per month) for 5 of those months. 
That is not enough to live on.
I applied for PIP in July and after providing all of the medical evidence of all these conditions and having a telephone assessment, I was advised that because I sounded ‘not in too much psychological distress’, and was ‘able to speak for myself’ in my appointment, I must not struggle cognitively. They have denied me PIP on the grounds that I spoke too clearly and calmly.

As a female ADHD-er, the daily masking is BIG, and that spreads to pain, meaning that even when my pain is at its worst, I will rarely show any evidence of it visually or verbally. 
I am so frustrated that they are able to just tell me that my suffering is not enough. All of my doctors are telling me I am unable to work, prescribing me so many different tests and medications to try to solve this, but apparently I’m not sick enough for government aid that is meant for this very situation.

I wish I had a legal footing to complain on the grounds of discrimination (?), but at the end of the day if someone decides that I am not sick enough based on my ability to have a clear conversation, they are absolutely protected by this system.";;;;

2025-09-24 13:42:55;Trans feminine male help;"I was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria (it's the thing trans men and women have when they are born into the wrong gender). My parents won't let me take cross sex hormones until I'm older, but I didn't want to wait, so I'm taking them without their permission and knowledge. Next month I'll be going in for my autism diagnosis. Is it safe to let my evaluator know I'm on cross sex hormones? I really don't want them to tell my parents

Will my evaluation be more similar to a woman's or a man's? I'm male socialized so idk if my diagnosis is contingent on whether they see me as a man or a woman";;;;
2025-09-24 12:27:33;Always attracting bullies;"Nearly from toddlerhood, the common thread in my life among other humans has been that I attract bullies.  For some reason my speech, my dress, my way of being antagonizes some individuals to the point they will go out of their way to criticize me publicly, try to provoke me to anger, even to the point of trying to seduce my very few girlfriends or wives, or having me fired. I have had people make public fools of themselves and even self-destruct in failed attempts to get at me.

From the playground to the academic meeting room to my job today, it honestly has seemed that I've drawn people who just want no good for me.  Something about my looks, my very existence just tips them off.  They'll ruin their own reputations even, to tell me what's what.  To expose me as a moron or an incompetent.  At the risk of prompting instant diagnoses of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, I have it on good authority from many non-bullies that I have been a terrific teacher and reporter.

I am reasonably certain I'm on the autism spectrum, with traits that range from the monotone monologues about the arcane to hesitancy of speech to weirdly selective forgetfulness to moments of stunned confusion to difficulty maintaining a steady eye gaze when talking.  As for the career I had and lost as a teacher, the recurring comments on student evaluations have been that I am ""weird"" and ""awkward.""  I guess I should count myself lucky they didn't cross into ""irritating"" or ""obnoxious"" in the 26 years I fronted classrooms.

I'm a middle-aged male adult and have been having to face it lately that the lack of professional and relationship success I anticipated may be owed to an autistic condition and that the condition may have deteriorated lately because of financial stress and just plain not being around anybody much anymore. I'm seeking an official diagnosis, but I am quite curious if others on the spectrum report this awful phenomenon.";;;;
2025-09-24 08:12:59;How do I meet women?;"I feel like this is sort of appropriate to post here, it's a bit tangential but I sort of want to discuss some psychological stuff and autistic experiences related to the op question, and I find this community to be really good and safe and understanding; the conversation here tends to be better quality than on the bigger autism subs. If not appropriate feel free to remove and I'll find somewhere else to post it, suggestions for where would be awesome!

I am an autistic man from the uk, and I want to get talking to some women, I feel like autistic women in particular would be good for me. I'll state some inhibitions and respect everyone's privacy. Basically I tend to fall in love quite slowly and it has to involve platonic connection before romantic, I'm very much a friends-first type.

I was diagnosed early, was an unmasked child, went to special school until the second half of high school, and have been more masked since to get by in education and work (but not high-masking). Sensory needs mostly boil down to: I don't tend to have too many problems just to go places, but to concentrate on a task or hold a conversation I cannot be in loud, crowded environments. Repetitive sounds tend to be particularly bad. I do some stims mostly in private. I'm absolutely hopeless with body language or eye contact, it's just a near-total foreign language for me. I don't know if I'd be level 1 or 2 if I was in USA or any country that does that.

I'm in my late twenties now and I have been single my entire twenties and with some mental health problems, I had a girlfriend when I was 18-19 for a year but it was not a great relationship and broke down before it became serious, which tbh I'm glad of because there was too much of a values mismatch. I've been knocked back quite a bit with occupational stuff due to autistic burnout and other complex mental health issues, I have a CS qualification and am taking a break before I start my degree, I'll probably get a job for a bit before then though because uni seems particularly bad for autistic burnout due to it being more social than work and having the whole feast-and-famine thing with intense semesters and then long gaps in between, it's hard to have a consistent routine especially with online classes ! I live independently but really struggle with consistent executive functioning, I just spark out as soon as I get home if I've been out and have struggled to get out other than for work and class a lot.

I know quite a few autistic women including one good friend who I see as being a really special friend and a potential partner, but things are a bit complicated due to trauma and stuff with her and we might just stay friends anyway so don't wanna put all my eggs in one basket especially since it's not the time to be making moves now anyway. And I'd have to be a stepdad which idk about because of sensory stimuli, my own health, alone time, and I haven't met the kid.

I've briefly tried some dating apps but I find the whole idea of them very difficult for two main reasons: it seems to include a lot of desperation for something to happen fast, and it feels like forcing something rather than letting it develop naturally. I'm not in a rush to fall in love, I just want to make friends with women and get to know each other first for the next while. Also I have not had a lot of luck with matches despite a few pictures and an authentic bio. I've known other autistic people with similar sensory needs to me get results from dating apps though. I'm absolutely rubbish at going out because everywhere seems to be too loud and crowded to meet up! Plus I'm usually too exhausted after work anyway.

I've been to a few social groups and have never had any luck there; I'm not really interested in much else besides hill walking and I've not had luck there with forming any connections outside the group. I'm into gaming a bit but not really social gaming. Maybe I could try playing board games or reading but it would be the kind of thing I wouldn't stick with if I wasn't making friends, so idk.

I know a few friends of friends and friends of family, but all the women in my age group are already in relationships. Nearly all the men aren't as well. LOL.

I think I'm pretty good at understanding emotions and I connect really well with people who can open up about their struggles and stuff and have had some really powerful conversations based on that, I think I'm a really caring, loving and understanding person and I'm good with boundaries and planning as well including around support and sensory needs.

Any more thoughts? I'd be interested in just discussing along the lines too, it's not like every response has to be a concrete answer ! Thanks !!

P.S. Sorry for info dump and very personal post !";;;;
2025-09-24 07:05:43;Pretend play?;"I have long suspected myself of having autism. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and very recently BPD. But I always felt like there was a quality to social interaction, especially with people I don’t know well yet or even more so in groups, that felt alien to me. In fact, I feel like an alien a lot of times. I’ve know my whole life that there was something different about me. I’ve always taken things literally. I’ve always taken things to heart. I could go into it more but that’s not the point with my post. My best friend has autism and she started suspecting me of having it as well. One day during a conversation I told her that I used to make up stories in my head and act them out as a child. She immediately told me that I didn’t have autism then because autistic children don’t engage in pretend play. She has since said multiple times, ”you’re the most autistic non-autistic person I know”.

When I think back to the play I had as a child, it was often vivid stories in my head with complex background stories and detailed character traits. Often times most of the story was in my head and I would use props to act out parts. I still can create rich vivid characters or scenarios in my head in seconds going off almost nothing where I almost start to feel their emotions and motivations. I have a very active imagination. It’s almost tangible. I also remember talking to stuffed animals as a child where they were talking to me about interactions they had with eachother when I wasn’t there. I think it was a way I processed heavy topics or emotions. I liked to play alone especially if I was making something and could also play with others but I usually focused around interaction with one other person where we acted out specific characters or rolls in a developing story.

There are many things I haven’t mentioned that point to possible autistic traits and I feel like autism would answer many questions I have about myself. Does this kind of play rule out autism?";;;;
2025-09-24 06:32:48;Does this sound like autism?;"I've been doing pretty intense research into autism for about two years now, and a couple weeks ago I told my mom that I thought I might be autistic. When we talked about it, she said that she didn't really think it was possible, so now I'm wondering if I accidentally convinced myself that I was autistic. I know that you guys can't give a diagnosis, but I was wondering if you guys think that this sounds like autism or if any of you guys experienced similar symptoms. (I compiled this list in about thirty minutes so I might have accidentally left some things off.)

* Always hated photos—In preschool photos I was always grimacing; one time when I was \~7 I was crying and screaming about having to take a photo in front of the Christmas tree
* Never really made friends without them approaching me first (since about kindergarten)
* Obsession with Doctor Who (but I don’t really talk to people about it very much because they usually make fun of me about it)
* Intense fixation on birthdates, birth years, and ages
* Refuse to eat slab meat (e.g. steak, pork chops) because of the likelihood of fat and bad bits; prefer to eat smaller pieces of meat or ground meat so that I can see everything and make sure that there is nothing I don’t want to eat. If I end up eating more than a tiny bit of fat or tendon, I will stop eating meat for the meal because I might end up accidentally eating more
* Obsession with grades; prefer to always have >96% so that there’s no chance of slipping to an A- (I've always had good grades and been considered gifted)
* No interest in spending time with people outside of school/camp settings
* I never know when to consider someone a friend
* Not good at texting; almost never text first
* I don’t like having people that aren’t my mom and dad in my house, and especially not unannounced. I don’t like when we host parties or when my family/friends come over (the only people who I’m okay with are my aunts)
* Hated getting my hair brushed until I was able to do it myself, would cry and scream every day
* Last year I had a Spanish class that was basically a free for all because the teacher didn’t like to teach or give assignments. Kids were always yelling, running around, and throwing things, and there was one kid who always smelled really bad. In the class after that, I would always be almost completely silent and would get really annoyed if I had to talk to anyone or if anyone tried to talk to me
* I have a pop-it on my school lanyard that made me stop hating school. Before I got it, I would constantly chew on my clear plastic ID case (I went through about 6 in 8 months)
* If there’s something I don’t want to do (e.g. washing dishes, homework), my body will physically not let me do it
* Never had any interest in trends and I always have to have slang explained to me by my friends or classmates
* The amount which I like a song directly corresponds to the amount of times I have heard it; due to this, all of my favorite songs are the ones that played a lot on the radio when I was little
* Wasn’t able to make out any song lyrics until I was about 8 (might not be an autism thing)
* Always preferred to talk to adults rather than people my age. In fifth grade, I would talk to the recess monitor for the whole time while my classmates were playing on the playground and in the field.";;;;

2025-09-24 04:29:10;Was anyone else an overly confident child?;"I know we hear a lot about introversion and shyness, but was anyone else a boisterous, confident child, despite having big social and communication issues? 

Maybe it's because I also have ADHD, I don't know...

I had all the signs of autism as a child, particularly socially, special interests etc...but I wasn't shy, at ALL. The opposite. I was confident and outgoing and keen to make friends, I just
...had no idea how, completely missed social ques, and was very ""bossy"", directing and lively. I completely alienated other children, particularly more sensitive girls my age. I was a whirlwind lol

Shyness and withdrawal only came later, after years of rejection and never being able to make friends :( probably around age 11

I feel so sad for child me sometimes. Now, as an adult, I'm extremely socially withdrawn and anxious, partly because of autism, partly because of the trauma of lifelong alienation and rejection. 

Anyway, just wondering if anyone else can relate to this particular presentation 

I'm in the process of getting diagnosed. I'm 97% sure I'm autistic (already diagnosed with ADHD, meet all the diagnostic criteria for ASD as far as I can tell), but the confidence as a child has me a little confused!! ";;;;
2025-09-23 22:05:32;3rd person Memories;"Almost all of my (few) memories of childhood/past times are in the third person.
As if I were standing behind myself, looking over my own shoulder.
 
My therapist and I are both wondering what the cause might be. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and autism, and had a traumatic childhood.
Could it be related to any of these or is that just normal for some people? 

Maybe anyone here has personal experiences or tips where to search for good answers :)";;;;
2025-09-23 14:57:29;Combination of ADHD, CPTSD and maybe Autism;"Hi all

I have been just coming to terms with the fact that I have ADHD. I have always been different but I have put in a lot of effort in masking (I believed that was the real me and the chaotic feelings or impulses are the stuff that need to go.) It is taking time to unlearn. 

I have experienced a significant number of traumatic events in my life right from my early years of childhood as well. I have also been hyperactive as a kid but didn't have enough outlets to spend this energy in. I wanted to do activities or hobbies but my dad was never really supportive of it so I couldn't. I needed money. Anyway I have grown up now and still struggle to use this energy wisely or constructively. 

I have been tinkering with the idea of ADHD and recently got diagnosed. But I still can't shake the belief of being neurotypical because that's the only way I have learned to be accepted by people around me. I am really good at masking. (Recently, I gave started being myself and that is definitely not going that great because my dear of retaliation is super high and people are nit that receptive either.) This also stems from the trauma from the past because I was treated poorly for being very energetic, impuslive, etc as a kid. I never had an ill  intention but that's how my family saw me. My cousins used to exclude me whenever they felt like I didn't fit in. Even friends (hard to call them friends) had their own thing. I have always felt excluded from everywhere and I never fit in despite trying so hard to do so. I am now facing these issues at workplace. 

Currently I am trying to pick my brain to see what belongs to what - patterns that are ADHD, CPTSD or maybe even autism (I experience a lot of disgust towards certain sensory experiences, I still don't have a diagnosis though). 

While I would love to get the right treatment for all of this, my mind is all over the place and I am very particular about getting it right. I also need to spend wisely. So I am still searching for my inner knowing or truth for this. I usually follow instincts when I feel it in my bones. So waiting for the moment when it all clicks. 

I wanted to check if anyon experiences the symptoms of all 3 and if yes, what have you been trying to help yourself? I am looking for some blueprints that I can work with. Any insight is appreciated. :) ";;;;

2025-09-23 02:17:28;Adhd & struggling with my hair;"Hi folks!

Looking for some advice.

I've got ADHD and some sensory issues. Since I got formally diagnosed, it's made me more aware of things I previously took for granted as finding a bit challenging, and actually made them more tricky!

I am a woman with slightly longer than shoulder length, reasonably thick, straight hair. I always wear my hair in a ponytail that's then folded in half back towards my head with a final loop of the hairband to create a loose bun. I find thick hairbands pull on my hair and feel uncomfortable/give me headaches, so I use very thin ones - however this often means my hair falls out of it as the day goes on, brushing against my face and tickling the skin. I have dry skin which can be itchy, and this makes it feel more uncomfortable. When I had longer hair, the only advantage was that it was actually easier to keep secure as it needed more loops of the hairband to stay up anyway. When my hair was shorter (too short to fully tie back), I found constantly having to tuck it behind my ears very annoying, and hairclips/slides on their own also pull at my hair and feel uncomfortable/painful, and don't keep it out of my face as much as I'd like. 

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations/advice? I've had super short hair before (ie stays out of my face by default because there's so little of it) but I missed having the option of doing stuff with it, even if that was relatively rare. I am also a cyclist, so hairclips that clip your hair back against the back of your head aren't an option (but I hate them too!)

Thanks in advance :)

2025-09-23 02:12:45;Why are mental health services such a wild west?? (Rant, sorry);"(Long vent post, TLDR below)
So the past 5 months the process of getting diagnoded and medicated for ADHD has been a pain lol.
It feels like in my country (which is probably middle of the road worldwide in terms of mental health support), and seemingly even countries with much more mental health awareness and support, mental health services both private and public are so goddamn inconsistent. I've had especially bad experiences with psychiatrists. It feels like i meet psychiatrists who have decades old information on things like ADHD, or psychiatrists who have harmful or misguided ideas like ""stimulants are only used for kids"", etc. Half my last session was my psychiatrist having technical difficulties on his laptop while looking for the dosages of strattera to see what comes after 25 (which is fair if i didn't have to wait *an entire month between dose increases*, *with important exams very soon*.)
Also there's classic stuff like ""it's just anxiety!"", Or psychiatrists going into my religious beliefs even after i straight up told them it was very personal, etc. And i'm going with private psychiatrists btw so idfk what i'm doing wrong here, man. Just wanna get treatment and move on with my life but nah.
I went into mental health services with the idea that these are professionals who keep up with the research, genuinely care, and know what they're doing. A few months in and it feels like they did all their research 20 years ago and are content with giving quick diagnoses and surface-level assessments. Absolutely no shame or humility in trying to make sure or understand a patient's needs.
I've always had an interest in mental health and i genuinely expected better tbh. I'm a little disappointed that it genuinely feels like it's not just people who care about people who go into this field, but rather the same kind of ""become a doctor and make easy money"" types, or the types content with treating people with 20 year old information in a field that's common knowledge that it changes drastically every decade or two. And especially that with this kind of field, you *have* to look out for biases and be a good critical thinker yet i've only had such an experience with my amazing psychologist, who is 1 of 4 mental health professionals i met btw. 2 were mediocre and inexperienced with ADHD but atleast didn't deny my diagnosis, the 3rd thinks i'm not hyper or don't do badly in school so i can't have it.
Sorry for the long post, it's just frustrating cuz it feels like talking to family about it, whom are already skeptical about mental health stuff, is hard when the proffesionals themselves kinda suck tbh (not all of them some of them are wonderful and supportive and i wouldn't have my diagnosis otherwise it takes. ).

TLDR: mental health professionals are painfully inconsistent and i really really think they should be held to a higher standard.";;;;
2025-09-22 18:33:52;Do you guys mask when you drink alcohol?;"I feel like i mask the most when i drink (diagnosed ADHD and BPD) ?? but when i was like 14 i was told they preferred me when i was drunk so maybe thats just a me thing?

edit: I always feel like whenever I drink i need to be “normal” as if my drunk self is annoying and unwanted, as why i made this post. I feel like im always limiting my behaviour and how i truely want to behave, even more so then when im sober. ";;;;
2025-09-22 10:03:13;Day in the life.;Recently I’ve being trying to figure out myself, I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age and it’s never really clicked with me that it’s a disability. Recently someone I trust to make the suggestion had suggested that I might be autistic, I don’t think I am, but I’m getting an assessment anyways. Lately tho, I have been making an effort to understand myself and come to an understanding that ADHD isn’t a fun little quirky word. I’ve been trying to outwardly express my emotions instead of actively suppressing or just outright ignoring them. Today I put on some headphones with white noise and took a walk, originally I planed to just go to a park near me, then get some food and go back home, however as i started walking I felt tense and, well I don’t know how to put it to word but I started to do what felt right, not necessarily instinctively or whatever but what felt like the right thing for me to do, while I was waking it felt kinda weird but I wasn’t tense or anxious, when I got to the park i had already planned what route I wanted to walk but then I seen the duck pond, so i bought a drink and found a bench that felt right to me and took a seat. I sat at the bench for over 2 hours watching the ducks, I don’t know what I felt but I think I felt content. I sat with white noise, and just kinda watched the ducks, and let my thoughts flow, I seen one with odd feathers and wanted to know why, so I took a picture and posted it on the duck subreddit and turns out it was molting. I made an effort to what felt right, and I don’t know how to explain it other than it felt good. I found my self smiling and laughing at the ducks, Matilda, the duck that was molting, slipped when she tried to get out of the water. I don’t have anyone in my life I feel comfortable talking to about this, sometimes it feels childish and then I stop doing what feels right to me. Today my cat had climbed on my shoulder and jumped onto the top of my door, I think usually I would have just taken her down and went about my business but today i let myself do what feels right. It felt childish, but I laughed, talked to her, got excited and let myself express my excitement with my arms. It felt right, but it also felt childish, I remember feeling negative about it and think I needed to stop. It feels childish, watching the ducks felt childish, expressing my emotions physically felt childish. I don’t think I’m going to stop, it feels right, but I don’t feel comfortable doing it around people.;;;;
2025-09-22 05:29:14;Canadian: Seeking Doctor for Late Autism/ADHD(?) Diagnosis;"Hi everyone -

Yes, this is a long shot in a dark hallway. I know.

For the 'howdoyouknow' crowd... there have been a lifetime of signs. A professional will be able to tell me one way or the other.

I'm female, late 30's, live in Canada, and still undiagnosed. Earlier this year, I found a psychologist who agreed to assess me for ADHD and Autism, but two sessions into the five sessions, I froze and spiralled. He was asking questions about my childhood neglect in a manner that was straight forward and without regard to my trauma. I left the session and never went back. The $500 I spent was a sunk cost.

(Oh and I probably have CPTSD, but there is no diagnosis for that.)

I'm ready to try again, but I'm hoping to find a ***Psychologist or Psychiatrist anywhere in Canada that specializes in late diagnosing women***. If this doctor happens to have a trauma informed lens, that would be incredible, but more of a bonus at this point. I plan to be more forthcoming with my trauma so they're aware of it.

Yes, this is going to be expensive. I've been saving.

If anyone knows any doctors in Canada who specialize in this, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could provide a name/number/email of who I can talk to about an assessment. Waitlists are okay if they meet the above criteria. Or, if there is some kind of resource/database out there that I'm not aware of - would be grateful if anyone can point me in that direction!

Casting my hopes into the internet void,

Me";;;;
2025-09-22 05:18:22;did I take this symptom of autism to literally?;"I'm 15 unofficially diagnosed with high functioning ASD

  
I tend to take certain things literally and now something came up to my mind

  
so, I did read that a lot of autistic people need a routine, that cant be changed.... What I initially thought was like, a full routine that cannot be change at all, which means there is also a set order to do things in (ex, for a morning routine : wake up - get dressed - eat break fast, and changing it to wake up - eat breakfast - get dressed would make an autistic individual upset)

  
what I'm wondering is if it's exactly what I just explained or something else : an approximate routine that can't like change a lot, but the order you do things in don't really matter.

  
related to this. If for example, I plan my whole day in my head but suddenly my plans have to change, I get upset, is that related to autism in any ways?

  
thank uuu";;;;
2025-09-22 01:06:32;Line of direction on where to go from here.;"Not sure if this is the right place for this? but it feels the safest to ask. I don't know if I should pursue a diagnosis right now and would like advice on where to go from here/ how to contact a psychiatrist. I want to make it very clear I'm not asking for some sort of diagnosis or anything, only if anyone has information on potential disorders that are harder to find clear information on/ might help lead me in a direction to which I can talk to a medical professional about. If too close to asking for one then oops sorry I can take this post down or however reddit works but that's really not my goal. I want to talk to a psychiatrist about this finally at some point but don't know where i'd ever start to go or who to look for when it comes to a potential diagnosis because I don't have the slightest clue what this might be. It may not be a disorder at all but just connected to my current ones/be a human thing but my dad agrees it's become extremely worrying so I atleast want to start thinking about it. My therapy sessions were just shortened to once every two weeks due to my school schedule, and my therapist isn't super crazy into diagnosis's and likes to work on more of a person to person basis so I don't know how much help she would be/ I'm diagnosed with a couple of things, only possibly relevant ones are autism adhd and severe OCD. I have a problem with socializing that started when I was 12/13. I suddenly start to have an undying alarming rage towards any of my friends for no reason and completely take myself out of their lives. Im 18 now and its happened all 4 times ive gotten close to someone since I was 12/13. It ends up triggering an OCD cycle of fear surrounding that person that once lasted like 3 years and lowkey made my teenage life hell. I am doing great ERP work and continue to. I do not think the inherent reason is due to OCD, perhaps aspects of it don't help my situation but it feels more like an afterthought my brain goes to after the hatred starts. I have 1 friend now who I really care about and talk to everyday. I don't want this to happen to them. But whenever they arent paying attention to me or leave me on read I get this feeling intense separation and a kind of a ""okay whatever I don't even need anyone"" thing, which I know is normal but mine feels too intense, I feel like I never want to speak to them again and just dont gaf about anything and get very upset. Then when i get a text back im completely okay againand its like nothing even happened. I don't think this is due to some sort of separation or abandonment issue caused by trauma, I don't have anything that could have potentially caused anything this extreme. Ive looked into schizoid personaity avoidant personaility bpd but none of them feel right. I just don't feel like I even have a direction of where to go with this issue, and it takes money and bullshit to go to a psychiatrist, so what if I go and theyre just like ""girl idk"". idk.";;;;
2025-09-22 00:46:30;what would you expect from your therapist?;Hello, i am neurodivergent psychologist. I am seeing clients under supervision as part of my master dagree. I want to focus on neurodivergent adults after i graduate. Even though i have some ideas from my own experience as well as my readings about how doing a therapy with neurodivergent adults. i want to hear more ideas and experiences from the receiving ends of the therapy. So can you share your good/bad experiences with your therapists especially about the topics related to your neurodiversity. Also you can share your opinion about how a neurodiversity affirming therapu should look like, what topics you prefer your therapist work on, which methods helped you, or harmed you, what you would have helped you when you got newly diagnosed/ or suspect about your neurodiversity and don't know much about it yet. Also neurodiversity almost now known in my country, and when i talk about this paradigm, most of the professionals argue against it. So if a client don't know this concept, i feel conflicted about introducing the neurodiversity term, and paradigm to them. Because it is somewhat controversial, and contradict with the mainstream psychology. I feel like they might benefit greatly from learning that (personally learning about neurodiversity changed my life) , but also it is not mainstream, and i afraid from people might thing i am forcing my own ideas and point of view to the clients. I know i asked a lot of questions in this post, but these are only some discussion points. I would appreciate much if you share any of your ideas and/or experiences about adult neurodiversity and therapy. ;;;;
2025-09-21 23:22:56;When with other autistic girls, I struggle to connect.;"I know autism isn’t a monolith and everyone is different. But I thought that maybe if I sought out individuals with similar diagnosis- I could get somewhere better socially. I don’t desire normal things and I don’t have normal thoughts, but even amongst a party of whom I thought would cultivate comfortable, happy company, I still feel ostracized even amongst the common type. Why do I feel so extremely and how come other girls still use and excuse me. How do I deal with the rejection of other autistic women? How do I accept myself when likeminded people would rather not have me around/ don’t see any use for me? Why am I struggling so much when I am only trying to have special friendships. Why does it always seem like they like to be around others more than me? Could I be asking for too much? Could I be overwhelming? 
Can anyone please relate to me/ offer words of affirmation I am not feeling too good…very hopeless and isolated in my mental space..


(Edit: thank you all so so so much for all your wonderful opinions, theories and advice! I am so thankful for the time a bunch of you gave to me today, I was not expecting such generous feedback.

2025-09-21 18:20:54;Suspecting autism but feeling unsure;"Hi, I hope this is the right sub for this, as I don’t really know where else to go. This post is a bit venty, I apologize. 

I’ve been on and off suspecting autism for about 3 years now, and I’ve recently started talking to my therapist about it (they can’t diagnose me), and we’ve done 2 screeners so far. In both screeners I had scores that were above the average of someone with autism, and I’ve taken dozens of other screeners over the years with similar results. I’ve done research on the symptoms and resonate with some of them, but I still feel unsure and afraid. 

I also struggle with OCD and social anxiety, and I’m worried they may be muddling the results. I tried speaking to a few friends (who have autism) about possibly having it, and I kind of feel like I can’t possibly have it because my friends didn’t catch it, and I always hear about how autistic people can easily clock other autistic people. One suggested it may be symptoms of another mental illness and now I just feel incredibly stupid.

For clarification it’s not that I’m scared of the idea of having autism, I’m scared of the possibility of being wrong and getting ridiculed for it. I always see people online shaming others who claim to have autism when they don’t, and I’m afraid I’m like that and unaware of it. It would also feel incredibly shameful to me if I told others I had it only to end up wrong.

I’ve seen others say that autism *must* be disabling in order to count as autism, and I don’t particularly feel like I’m disabled by it so that’s another point against it. At most my only ‘counterpoint’ is that I have OCD, and sometimes I’m fine but other times it sucks ass. While it doesn’t *feel* disabling to me, it interferes with my life on a daily basis to the point it would be considered disabling. 

I have debated the idea of pursuing a professional diagnosis (or undiagnosis? Idk, just a “yes you have it” or “no you don’t” type thing) but it’s expensive, and in the case I do have it I’ve heard that a diagnosis can make life difficult. 

I really don’t know. I’m just afraid right now and not being able to have a clear cut yes or no answer is driving me insane and I have nobody to talk to about it. I just wish I knew so I could stop feeling like an idiot for thinking I might have it when I might not. ";;;;
2025-09-21 08:50:36;Memory problems when unmasking;So i've been diagnosed about 6 months now aged 34. Realised a while back that I mask basically constabtly atound non close family and friends. Recently I've been a lot more comfortable and have let my mask down a lot among certain groups. But when trying to recall the interactions, i can't get any clarity from it...

2025-09-21 08:21:25;I've been diagnosed with Level 1 Autism and I'm a little confused!;"This is the title!

I finally received my diagnosis: Autism Level 1. I won't go into detail, but I'll summarize: my cognitive abilities are preserved (my total IQ on the WAIS Scale is 122, with difficulties with divided attention, but ease with other things, according to the tests). I don't present specific and obvious sensory signs like almost all autistic people, and this worries me about my diagnosis, whether or not I really ""have the right"" to classify myself as autistic. In addition to autism, my secondary symptom is ADHD, although it's only secondary, as it accompanies autism, so I can't ""officially"" say I have ADHD.

The most severe part of my diagnosis involves cognitive rigidity, where my brain organizes my entire routine, and when something deviates from the norm, I get really upset and try to think of new mental paths to achieve that goal. My social life isn't the best either, despite being a communicative person; I prefer to isolate myself rather than go to parties and clubs, but I'm not averse to socializing. I just prefer being alone more than being around other people. However, I feel good being around people I know. Finally, I've had stereotypical movements for a long time, since childhood. However, this isn't considered Stereotyped Movement Disorder (SMD) because it doesn't cause me any harm; it's as if I make random movements with my body automatically, but consciously. I interpret it as a way to control my anxiety, but I honestly don't know if that's the correct meaning.

Are there people here who fit into a situation like mine: insensitive to sounds, smells, textures, or noises, but with a social impairment (a preference for isolation) and behavioral rigidity? I read the entire DSM-5 on the autism topic and came away more confused than I went in. I feel that all of this I mentioned alone is not enough for me to be autistic, so I am left with a cruel doubt about this, whether or not I really have autism, even though the tests have shown that I do.";;;;
2025-09-21 07:40:23;How has identifying as neurodiverse/as someone with adhd/austism changed your life? Would also like to hear from people who had a hard time accepting their diagnosis.;"I apologize if any of what I write comes across as ableist. I’m doing my best. I don’t know all the correct terminology to use as I’m new to this and I know everyone prefers different terms. This is my own personal experience and my own feelings. 

I may have mild/moderate adhd and I’m having a hard time accepting it/ wrapping my mind around it. It’s been floated as an option before but not sure how much it impacts my life. I’m a 40 year old woman by the way. 

I know there’s some impact for sure. My therapist recently said she wondered if I was on the neurodiversity spectrum. And when she said that I do have to admit I felt a bit defensive/ashamed. I already identify as neurodiverse because I’m highly sensitive but for some reason this other label is causing me to feel like this. I should mention that part of the reason is that I’ve been chronically ill since 16 and have multiple chronic illnesses. I’ve always felt different than the rest. I think adding this to the mix feels like a lot. 

Would like to hear from others who have gone through similar feelings and also those who identify as having adhd/ autism. How has identifying this way helped you? How has it not? I’d like to hear all experiences. Thanks so much. ";;;;
2025-09-21 06:08:18;Told I might be masking unknowingly;"I'm an undiagnosed possibly neurodivergent person, recently in my college my teachers have been working towards trying to get me a diagnosis for autism and possibly ADHD.

I had a meeting a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I was talking about my struggles, and I was told that they highly suspect I am AuDHD, and that I'm unknowingly masking. The problem is that I am very loud and destruptive to those around me (unintentionally), which I thought wouldn't be a behavior Id mask with? Especially if it's unintentional?

 I'm honestly just confused and wanted to see if anybody could have any insight? If you'd like more info I'd be happy to provide some :)";;;;
2025-09-21 02:50:34;From napkin balls to fidget atoms – life upgrade;"Hi everyone,
I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder, but I’ve always felt like there’s something else going on – another reason why my brain just works differently from others.
Right now everything feels way too much, and I get overwhelmed so easily. In public, I sometimes feel like a possum just freezing — as if the things that overwhelm me would care if I actually dropped dead 😂
This is where the internet (and all of you) come in. I started looking into ways to cope and somehow stumbled onto fidget toys and ADHD coping mechanisms. And honestly, it’s incredible how much clicks into place. I’ve tried several fidget toys (and destroyed a couple on the first day, lol), but I also found my favorite little squishy things and fidget atoms. (Does anyone know where to get a tiny version of those atoms, like an inch or so?)
Now I don’t tear napkins into 300 little balls in restaurants anymore. I don’t tap my legs constantly. I don’t scratch the glue off the seams of my bags. I just play around with my little squishy blob, and it actually helps.
I even tried some earplugs thanks to recommendations here. It still feels a bit strange, but I think I like them. Haven’t tested them in “hardcore” situations yet, but at least at home they’re working.
By now I’m pretty sure I have ADHD, but getting diagnosed here literally takes years because of the demand. Still, it’s such a relief (and sometimes really weird 🫣) to read that so many of you experience the same things. It’s definitely a reality check — turns out I’m not a superhero with super-hearing just because I can follow every single conversation in a coffee shop. Would’ve been cool, though. But hey, you get what you get and you don’t get upset.
Thanks to all of you 😘";;;;
2025-09-21 02:08:01;Autistic Burnout and Loss of Skills;"I've been recently on a bit of a journey to figure myself out, and reading up on autism, shutdowns, meltdowns, and autistic burnout. I've watched a ton of videos, read up on the books that are usually recommended, and tried to get a diagnosis with very little success. I'm gonna try to rein in more personal stories of that kind because this is not what the post I was gonna make was about. 

Essentially, ""loss of skills"" is a symptom, if you want to call it that, of autism, but I can't really wrap my head around what that means. Maybe I'm taking the ""loss"" part too literally or something?";;;;

I have tried asking professionals for help in better understand how my diagnoses affect me, and how to cope. So far nothing has helped me. 

Until I caved in and used ChatGPT. I know that I can't trust everything it says. But It has really made me understand how I function.

For example, I am one of those that always ask people about themselves, and I usually have the same questions. I do this because it helpes me sample information, and apparently it is my strategy. I didn't know this. But it makes a lot of sense.

2025-09-20 19:46:30;How do I go about getting tested as a 17yo?;"Hi there! 17m, I was diagnosed with adhd a few years back (everyone around me already knew I had it, so did I) but I have been feeling that there’s still something more that I’m missing. 

      Lately I’ve been doing a lot of research making a list in my notes app of all the stuff that I used to or currently do that are autistic traits, and in the few days I’ve made it, the list has grown exceedingly long and keeps growing. 

       I’ve read people’s personal stories about having high masking autism and it feels like my life is being described perfectly. I’ve brought this up to my mom before, but she’s a special needs teacher and so when I said “I think I might be autistic” it was almost like alarm bells rang in her head because the level of autistic kids that she has taught over her many years as a teacher have been very severe on the spectrum. She completely shut me down and would have no part in the conversation. 

        Is there any way I can go about getting tested? I always had trouble not skipping school because I think masking (whether it’s adhd or autism or both) took so much out of me that I just couldn’t take it anymore, luckily I’m in online school now and couldn’t be happier. But pretty soon I’ll be starting college and I definitely don’t want to stay online for that, meaning I’ll have to go in person, and if i do that, I’d rather know whether or not I’m autistic so I can better understand how to go about schooling without getting so burnt out. Any advice would be appreciated, also I do have a therapist and I’m in the us, if that’s helpful information. Thanks!";;;;

2025-09-20 04:00:25;kinda visual perception disorder;"Hello y’all , 

I suffering from what appears to be a perceptual disorder likely linked to my psychiatric disorders, and I would like more information about this symptom.

It's a very strange sensation where I feel like my visual perception is completely changing. I see things with much more intensity, and it's very disturbing.
I feel overstimulated, colors and shapes are much more vivid and intense (I can't stand patterns, for example). I can't stand seeing any black objects or things, like a computer keyboard or a black t-shirt, because I feel like I'm going to be sucked into them like a black hole; QR codes are very strange to look at, unlike usual.
Also, I feel like my irises or pupils (I don't know but much my irises in my opinion, this phenomen is call miosis ) are dilated ; some of my loved ones have also pointed this out to me. 

What I see seems more ""real"" and I feel like I'm receiving too much visual information, as if there are too many visible things around me, much more than usual. It's as if I have magnifying glasses instead of eyes.

It started when I was going through a  burnout, and it was the first symptom of the psychotic episode I was experiencing at that time. Since then, it happens to me when I go too long without sleep (during my psychotic episode, I can't sleep either) or when I forget to take my antidepressant. anti-psychotics use to help but I don’t want to take it anymore because I know this this isn’t hallucination. 
I don't see anything that isn't there (like monsters, people, or things that aren't there), and things don't appear distorted or anything; it's just my vision that's altered. After that, I sometimes saw a little blurry, but the glasses the ophthalmologist prescribed didn't change anything. The blurred vision improves on its own and do not stay more that a few days. 

You should know that I have suffered from extreme fatigue (asthenia) and paresthesia ( tingling, burns, hot and cold sensations ) for several years, and doctors haven't been able to find the cause or even treat these symptoms. Following this, I suffered from psychiatric disorders (two psychotic episodes and severe depression) and psychiatrists believe that asthenia and paresthesia are psychosomatic and not somatic as I am convinced. I am also convinced that all these symptoms are linked to the same illness.
I don't have a diagnosis yet for the symptoms as a whole, but a psychiatrist I consulted spoke to me about « visual distortions » and « functional neurology disorders ». I haven't been prescribed any tests or examinations for this symptom because the psychiatrists I consulted considered this sensation normal given my psychiatric history of psychosis. 

Have you ever heard of what I'm describing?

Are there any students/researchers/caregivers or patients who have already heard of this disorder and who know of illnesses that may be the cause?

Most of psychiatrists or psychologists I've spoken to don't seem to really take this symptom into account, perhaps because I can't really describe and explain it well.

If you have more information, please share it!  

Thanks :)

2025-09-19 19:56:41;How can I organize my thoughts? I need advice.;"Hello, I am a young student of 17 years old, electrical engineering student.

During my life I have had intrusive thoughts of all kinds, from random thoughts to thoughts of ending my life, many times I have come to cry for things that are nothing to see and other times I get excited about insignificant things, I am someone diagnosed with autism spectrum level 1 (Asperger's) and ADHD, especially in a hyperactive form.

I have noticed that when I am left doing nothing my mind simply looks for ""how to pass the time"" because I simply cannot stay doing nothing or doing something boring, therefore my mind begins to throw as many spontaneous thoughts that appear disappear which makes me unable to pay attention to classes or I simply became filthy in so many thoughts and even imagining fictitious scenarios that make it have an impact on my life or mental health.

It should be noted that music does not work for me, sometimes I start imagining fictitious scenarios with Linkin Park music in the background, it is epic, but it distracts me a lot.

I would like if someone goes through my situation to give me some kind of advice that has helped them.

A warm greeting to all readers, I look forward to your comments.";;;;
2025-09-19 17:28:08;Does anyone else have a diagnosis of intellectual disability?;I received this diagnosis because I have a hard time socializing with others and being motivated. And I was wondering if anyone else here has this diagnosis? And if so, what are your struggles? ;;;;

2025-09-19 15:35:56;Frustration boiling over;"To preface I have ADHD and Autism diagnosed as an adult, then an old diagnosis of OCD from when I was 15. 

Whenever I feel backed into a corner or extremely overstimulated into a meltdown I feel like physically fighting others. Whether it’s my partner, coworker, or whoever I get an urge to throw a right hook. It feels like a fleeting thought because immediately when I get that thought I feel immediately horrified by even wanting to inflict violence on others. 

In the past as a kid I’d punch and get into tussles with family members. Is this normal with autism? My diagnosis hasn’t been really dug into, I’ll mention this at my next therapy session. My partner and I got into an argument over soup tonight. I didn’t have all the ingredients and I felt super pissed about the situation. Redirecting my anger to the situation helps. He doesn’t understand why Id melt down over this. Then he asked if I’d ever thought about hitting him and I said I don’t want to, admitted it. Again this is not something I want, I only feel this was when I’m extremely emotionally dysregulated. Tonight I didn’t feel like hitting him that may have been stopped by me redirecting the frustration toward the situation. 

Lately with work I have felt alien with communicating. My job is on the rocks with a PIP. We are in the middle of moving and finances are tight. I do see my therapist regularly just not this week because I’ve been sick. When I get this overwhelming rage it gets concentrated into my hands. Has anyone in this group experienced this? I’m so freaked out by even feeling this way and scared that I need to know if this is the right place. What it feels like to me is a young child inside me having a huge meltdown/tantrum. Sorry for the rambling I needed somewhere to ask. I don’t feel like a threat to myself or others, it’s just only in times of a boiling meltdown. I just don’t understand. ";;;;
2025-09-19 15:06:34;Is anyone undiagnosed and more scared of NOT having a disorder?;"I hate being undiagnosed and considering a disorder
I’m suspecting inattentive adhd, my mom is diagnosed with adhd, both of my psychiatrists independently considered it, and I have symptoms my whole life. 

I’m scared of not having it, and I’m just genuinely this stupid all the time and life is this hard. Atleast if you have ADHD it’s better than being just very dumb all the time, which seems like the only outcome if I don’t Get diagnosed with ADHD. 

I’m not necessarily saying ADHD is a good or bad thing, I’m saying I’d rather have the reason for my struggles be ADHD, than genuinely being this stupid all of the time with much less solutions than if I did have ADHD. A diagnosis of ADHD or not doesn’t change any struggles I have, it just explains why. ";;;;
2025-09-19 09:44:23;Are these autistic traits?;"I posted something like this before but I compiled a better list. I’m not asking for a diagnosis but I just want to know if it matches.

These are the traits:

1. I have a really weird sense of justice and I always did even as a child, I can't forgive people easily

2. I extensively observe what people are doing in public settings, even when they're talking to me, I tend to miss what they say because I'm just looking at them or away

3. I do this thing where I plan out the most efficient way to do something, like a cascade of events from like a to b and that's where I get my night rituals too like I always do it in this specific Sequence

4. I think I have photosensitivity to the sun because I'm always squinting in it where I don't think other people do as much

5. I hate old chicken taste and bone in chicken and eggs and bell pepper, l used to be really picky with food and only got in carbs until recently where I put effort into getting more stuff in

6. l've rewatched movies like a bunch of times in a span of like a week or two, and I listen to a set of songs over and over until the vibe changes idk

7. Im obsessed with finding out what's wrong with me

8. I have a break down every week or so and honestly think it might be shutdown, like I get to the point of hair pulling and throwing things, I also used to hide in my closet as a teenager, and now I just close the lights and sit against the door

9. Leaving uni everyday makes me want to cry and I feel exhausted every time

10. I think I do a lot of novelty chasing to the point of obsession and then when I get it or it's complete I find the next thing

11. I’m always shaking my legs, I also bite my lips and play with jewelry a lot

12. I’ve been socially ostracized from a very young age, and have also lost the friends I had in middle school to high school 

13. I used to have issues with socks, clips, baby oil

12. I don’t know if this counts but I noticed I generally I avoid jeans and have mostly filled my closet with sweats and skirts

13. I also used to have periods of things I was obsessed with ranging from Percy Jackson to boys and girl best friends, scooby doo lol, avatar, and right now now I think it’s psychology and maybe ai";;;;
2025-09-19 07:34:05;Wondering what’s going on with me😓;"I’m a teenage girl and have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but i feel like there’s something else going on with me and i feel very confused. Also english isn’t my first language so excuse me if i don’t make any sense😓😢

I’ve had what i think are panic attacks ever since i can remember. I have memories from kindergarten of me panicking and crying and not being able to breathe and stuff like that. When i was little i walked on my toes but have since unlearned that since my mom didn’t like it haha. i fidget with my fingers a lot, it started with nail biting but escalated to picking and biting and my skin causing bleeding and sometimes scarring, it does hurt a lot but idk if it’s self harm but putting the tag just in case. I do still do this. I repeat certain words (similar to vocal stims but i don’t wanna call it that since i don’t have an autism diagnosis and i don’t wanna be disrespectful)
I have a very hard time communicating because i get misunderstood and am very sensitive causing me to break down. I get overwhelmed extremely easily, something like someone talking or touching me makes me feel very anxious. I can’t handle noises in public and usually cry when i come home. I have issues with eye contact. I cannot sleep for the life of me. Issues with loud noises, chewing noises, breathing and certain lights. I bite the inside of my cheek. I have a hard time making friends and get very attached to the ones i have. Have difficulty with certain textures and clothing. I don’t feel any sexual attraction or feelings and have like almost never had a crush and remember making fake crushes to seem normal around friends while talking about who we liked. 
Have an extremely hard time brushing my hair and with the noises and feeling. Food difficulties, i usually just end up eating the same thing for months until im tired of it and feel sick😓Brushing my teeth is uncomfortable but i still do it of course don’t worry. I usually watch the same show and read the same books over and over again. I have extreme issues in school. The environment is very overwhelming and has caused me huge absence and even doing school from home for a whole year because i couldn’t handle it. My dad is neurodivergent (not autism) and my dad and i think my mom might have adhd. There’s more but i forget, it’s late where i am.

I have gotten tested before, they told me i have a tiny bit of autism but not enough to get on the spectrum and it’s probably just anxiety. But to come back when im older if i still have issues after anxiety treatment. I’ve had anxiety treatment and still have all the issues i used to have and i feel like i might have something going on. My parents think i probably just am very sensitive, which could very likely be the case!! I just need confirmation from other people so i can stop stressing about this.";;;;
2025-09-19 06:08:33;Does someone with ADHD and Asperger's struggle with attention in college? I need advice;"Hello everyone! I'm Miguel, I'm 17 years old and I study electrical engineering. I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type) and autism spectrum disorder level 1 (Asperger's) at age 14. Lately, or rather, my entire life, I have had a hard time paying attention in class because I feel a physical need for constant stimuli (like using my cell phone, watching TikTok or writing, anything that gives me stimulation, I can't stay doing nothing, I feel super uncomfortable and it makes me feel bad in general). If I don't, I become incredibly anxious and unable to concentrate.

I was the best of my generation in school, I entered the most difficult university in my country by pure luck, since I never studied because it was impossible for me, now if I continue with this lifestyle I may not be able to continue with my career or my life.

What I have tried:

· Take notes in class, but I still get distracted.
· Use breathing techniques, but they don't work for me.
· Schedule short breaks, but it is difficult for me to regain concentration.
· Try to listen to music at specific Hz to concentrate.
· Drink little coffee because it seemed to help.
· Make concept maps

My question for you:

· How do they manage the need for stimuli in demanding environments?
· Are there strategies that have helped you at university?
· Has anyone found ways to channel that need for movement or stimulation without affecting their productivity?
· Any advice for studying or managing anxiety - worry about random things in life?
· Any study method to study literally?

I appreciate any advice as I feel like this is affecting my academic performance and my life. Thanks for reading me!

Update:

It's been 3 days since this post was first uploaded that I realized something: If I study while talking to someone about the same topic and then we debate with them, a hyperfocus feels incredible. I recommend studying what can be reading, doing math exercises, watching an educational video with someone (it is better with the opposite sex than you) and then discussing what you understood, I did it and learned 70-80% of everything.";;;;
2025-09-19 05:01:23;Can I take this as a soft diagnosis?;At this point it’s not entirely a “self diagnosis” right? Do I say my therapist suspects I’ve got it and I just haven’t been formally diagnosed yet?;;;;
2025-09-18 22:08:04;I think I might be neurodivergent;As the title suggests, I've a few doubts about myself.

I'm no stranger to mental health stuff, I've been diagnosed with BPD, anxiety and depression. I've tried to convey my doubts abt this to my previous therapist but he shut it down immediately and i just let it go. But recently these doubts have resurfaced. I know short form videos on apps can be misleading, are there any resources I can refer to learn more abt this?;;;;
2025-09-18 16:23:48;I get upset for weird reasons;"I hate repeating myself and if someone forces me to do it I cry or panic. I don’t mind repeating when someone genuinely didn’t hear me, but I resent having to explain the same thing again. Especially over text, they can just scroll up and read my earlier message. I don’t know why would they want me to repeat myself.

And I get upset and confused when people use incorrect words or grammar and expect me to understand. Imprecise or illogical statements also confuse me and trigger panic.

This causes friction with my friends, and I hate that I react this way. I don’t want to make everyone around me uncomfortable. Any advice?

Also, could this be related to ADHD? I’m only diagnosed with ADHD.";;;;

2025-09-18 05:05:13;I feel like I have no personality / I don’t know who I am;"Hello! I‘m not sure if this is the right subreddit and this is my first time posting something to reddit but I want to know if anyone can relate to my situation.

I am a 18yo female (not diagnosed with anything, I have my suspicions though) and my entire life i‘ve always felt different from my friends, family etc. 

I grew up relatively poor, my parents seperated when I was 12 and my mother is kind of a hoarder. It’s usually pretty messy in our house. There‘s a whole lot more to unpack but whenever I went to other people‘s houses I realized the way I grew up wasn’t normal and that I should hide everything about the way my home life is.

Not just that, but also my interests. I was the „quiet anime kid“ at school and in my friend group I was always the one they picked on or made jokes about. I didn’t have anyone to talk to about my interests (except one friend that went to a different school) and I know my friends meant no harm but at that time i felt really hurt by it. 

By the time i was 14/15 I found my people however I still ended up being the one everyone made jokes about and that really made me second guess everything and be suuper sensitive to sarcasm (my now coworker jokes about having to teach me sarcasm 😭) 

This is all over the place but what I‘m trying to say is that no matter who I am around, I feel like i always put on a mask around everyone. I don’t have anyone opinions on anything and just agree with what the rest thinks, which i really hate about myself. It feels like im cosplaying me if that makes sense??
Also, since I‘ve been 12/13 I always picked a character from a show I liked at that time and tried to behave like them, because I myself don’t know how I should act. I apologize if there are any grammar mistakes and if this is all over the place as English is not my first language ";;;;
2025-09-18 04:33:35;Embrace Autism Experiences?;"Curious if anyone has undergone assessment with this organization and how they felt the experience was handled? 

I'm a wee bit hesitant to pursue an online assessment, but the providers are all diagnosed autistics, and the price looks to be less than half of what it would otherwise be in my area.";;;;
2025-09-18 04:05:36;Does being aware you’re autistic make you more autistic?;"Edit: forgot to mention I’m 26M, mixed race
 
Tl;dr: there were indications I was autistic growing up but they weren’t problematic enough that I couldn’t figure it out eventually. I thought I was awkward as a kid but had no problems making friends and I realized I inwardly felt strange but outwardly I was actually masking properly. Now though, post-self diagnosis, masking feels substantially harder to do, I see autistic traits as making up half my personality, my identity as being AuDHD often occupies my conscious thought, and that’s one of the things I’m always thinking about in terms of my identity.
 
I considered myself a master at adapting to social situations but now I realize I was just exceptionally good at masking. And now I feel like that skill has waned to the point that I’m not confident I still possess it.
 
So the question: why do I feel so darn autistic (I’m legitimately considering the possibility of being Level 2 and I’m actively talking about it with my therapist) now that I know I am, compared to the rest of my life? 
 
Anyways, here’s more context if you don’t mind reading:
 
Growing up, tons of signs were there but masking was high, masking was second nature, and masking was constant. Had no idea how much effort I was expending to mask all the time or how often it was happening. Was still a weird kid but parents and adults chalked it up to being “quirky” since that comes with being so “gifted,” and clearly I was normal since I had no problem making friends (even if I was quite shy) and would regularly engage with adults in “normal conversation” as a three year old.
 
Fast forward to a formal ADHD diagnosis around age 21. I see how much pain I went through as a kid with how much I realize it affected me growing up (I’m an inattentive type with some elements of impulsivity), so I deep research to understand it as much as possible and realize how much it’s affected me so I can accommodate.
 
But some things don’t add up. I have certain weird tendencies which aren’t explained by ADHD and others which seem contradictory to it, but I was diagnosed with it so how could I have this opposing trait *at the same time*? Then I discover I might be autistic. 
 
Flash forward another couple years and I’m quite confident in my self diagnosis of being ASD and I also have a formal ADHD diagnosis, so I identify as AuDHD. Now though, I actually feel more autistic than just a couple years ago. I feel like I behave in ways that seem more aligned with me but are also definitely not normal, and masking feels like it takes so much more effort than ever before. I’m far more aware of sensory issues that were previously ignored and compartmentalized away. I’m suddenly finding eye contact to be troublesome, uncomfortable, and often avoided. Not to mention at least half the things I thought were just my weird personality quirks are apparently autism coded. 
 
Am I more autistic? Does being aware of the autism make you more autistic? Does being aware of how much you mask make it harder to mask? Is there a proper amount of masking I should be doing in public? Is it “wrong” to act in ways that feel natural for me but are clearly not neurotypical and could come off as rude? How much of my personality is just my personal flavor of autism? Is it okay for autism to be half my personality? How much should I be okay with talking about it to others to help them understand who I am?";;;;
2025-09-18 02:55:26;How can I let my mom know I think I have autism?;"
DISCLAIMER: I am not self diagnosing and I’m not asking for a diagnosis, I’m just curious on the steps of getting diagnosed and any advice would be helpful!!

Since as young as I can remember, I have always felt different than others. I’m 16 now and I struggle with mental health issues daily. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD, however I never felt like OCD was the right diagnosis. I do feel the need of lining items up or feeling certain textures, having to follow specific patterns or routines but OCD is usually accompanied by thoughts that make you feel like you have to do something(correct me if I’m wrong). I just don’t feel right with that. I have sensory issues to loud sounds especially vacuums. Everytime I hear one I cover my ears or have to avoid it in any way possible. I constantly am wearing either airpods or headphones to drown out any noise by listening to music or just having noise canceling on. I hate bright lights and prefer dim or no lights. Stimming is also a really big thing for me, I know you can also stim while not being ND, so this may just be something I do. I struggle with friendships and have a new best friend almost every year. I’ve never been able to keep friendships or go deeper than just acquaintances. I never know when to speak in group settings and small talk feels uncomfortable or fake. Social cues have never made sense to me or if they do, I don’t see the need for them. I know there is so much more to autism than that and I’ve done my research fairly well and I relate or have almost every sign of level 1 autism. The list would be far too long to write on here but if anyone could give advice on asking my mom about getting tested for it, I would appreciate it!";;;;

I also realize that the reason I read more during the school years when I was younger is because the teacher or my fellow classmates would read it aloud... I really should have figured out I wasn't neurotypical sooner 🤣

P.S. The ✨️sparkles✨️ is meant to be read as sarcastic";;;;
2025-09-17 13:14:26;cptsd diagnosis, Trying to understand myself, any opinions welcome;"So I've been diagnosed with adhd a year ago though I don't really agree with it because I know adhd shares a lot of similarities with cptsd, ocd, bpd, autism, etc. I know for sure I have cptsd. I've never particularly cared for diagnosis or labels partly out of spite( ""I don't wanna be like other people, it's a trend, blah blah"") and partly because as long as my problems were fixed, I didn't care what label it was through.

Something very traumatic happened in my life when I was 9. the after math of it continued to affect me and is the primary reason for my cptsd diagnosis. before that, I was top of the class, loved reading, always had a hard time w/ play pretend/playing with dolls. I usually liked watching other girls play.

the only ""unusal"" thing about my early childhood is that my mom says I used to be really ""wild"" before the age of 7, like throwing tantrums that wakes up the whole neighborhood because my new born brother peed and I *thought* the piss touched me. or running out of the house naked if I didn't like the outfit.

After 9, I continued to excel in school. Even though I was never professionally trained, I was pretty decent at whatever I tried (drawing, singing, dancing, speech, etc). I had a hard time ""lying"" even if I knew it'd get me in trouble and it continued to make my relationship especially with my parents, worse. (It still affects my relationship with my wife). For example, if you asked me to do the dishes, regardless of whatever mood you were in, I'd generally answer truthfully. This doesn't always go well because I'm aware that sometimes it's better to say ""yes"" or do what's asked of you especially if it's not a big deal. But I had such a hard time forcing myself. Until I got into a relationship, it used to feel like I'm genuinely betraying myself if I said something I didn't 100% mean in certain situation. I've hurt a lot of people with ""being myself/raw honesty"".

This has been a recurring theme in my life. I always had a very strong sense of self since probably 5 or as long as I can remember. And I'd do this thing where I'd evaluate myself every year or so and make sure I'm still the same person aka ""staying true to myself."" I'd check my values, my interests, everything. I took a lot of the religious and philosophical teachings very seriously and some of these teachings continue to guide my life. My hobbies/interests are the same as it was since I was very young, down to the genre of books I like. I picked up one/two small interests recently but that's about it.

Another recurring theme has been always feeling like there's something deeply wrong with me. even as a kid. this feeling only intensified at 14 after I realized I might be gay.

Two years ago, everything changed. I lost my family because of my sexuality and w/ that, also lost my connection w/ my culture and religion both of whom were also important to me. Something in me neurologically shifted. As I learned later that our brain does rewire itself after a big loss/trauma. Since then, I've been having a hard time trying to get back to normal or as my therapist said ""figure out my new normal because you're never gonna be the person you used to be."" (this threw me into a complete breakdown because majority of my life, my sense of identify and self came from evaluating myself and telling myself ""I'm always the same person"" but anyways, I stopped thinking about this because if I think for more than a minute, my brain spirals).

I've always been someone who lived a lot inside their head. But in terms of sensory/physical things, I used to be very particular about lighting and always kept the curtains a certain away. I cannot stand notification. It feels invasive. i had to fight w/ myself a lot to allow notif for emails and texts because I literally missed interviews, job offers, and ofc, many interactions from friends and partner. I  am very strong about needing a physical space to retreat to when I'm overwhelmed. so much so I couldn't stand my cat sleeping with me or being in my room for too long. Also used to have problem with my partners staying over for more than one night. anytime I didn't have my physical space to be with myself alone, I'd feel suffocated, physically. It changed a lot over time in the last 3 years. I'm married now and have three cats. Idk if it's a correlation but my life also feels most out of control and overwhelming the more I lose these quirks. I still need this physical space and in fact, my apartment is designed in a way that I can shut myself in a room whenever I need it (which I still do, but I'm more out of touch w/ my body now and not always aware of my needs).

other things might be helpful to know to share your opinion: I used to have a hard time with eye contact and asking too much questions. After being bullied and humiliated over time, I did enough homework and learned to improve those skills. in the past two years, I've been trying to get better at not interrupting others.

Other stuff is the classic things like black and white thinking, emotional disregulation. recent years, I've also struggled with time blindness and forgetfulness+brain fog. it's funny I feel like I started experiencing symptoms of ADHD more AFTER the diagnosis and taking meds.

so i guess I wanted to hear from actually autistic folks if they think I might be on the spectrum. My therapist said if I am autistic, I masked really well for a long time because I until I shared a lot of my inner thoughts (like sense of self stuff) she didn't question it.";;;;
2025-09-17 08:05:21;Feeling like you’re constantly faking it, even when you aren’t late diagnosed;If I feel in a pretty content or a relaxed day for the whole day, I automatically feel like I’m faking it. Anytime I can hold conversation conversations and actually enjoy talking ( which is daily, even though it’s with people with ADHD) I think I must be faking it. Whenever I notice a day where I’m not fidgeting or stimming much ( which is rare I do very often) I feel like I’m faking it. Every time I get a joke I feel like I’m faking it. Every time I have a good day I feel like I’m faking it. I just constantly feel like I’m faking it like I probably think about this for 70% of the day. It makes me feel insane whenever I feel meta aware of myself in certain situations, I mean, I don’t feel like I’m disabled?? I don’t know. I just wanna know if you feel this way too.;;;;
2025-09-17 05:20:24;so incredibly frustrated;waited a couple months to get into a new psych that does adult autism testing. had my first appointment today, first issue…the place was incredibly hard to find. second the appointment was by phone and i was never told about this, i was waiting in the office then got a phone call asking if i had time to talk. third issue, when i told them i was seeking an asd assessment they asked if i was working. i am so i said yes. they then asked me if i was looking to get permanent disability with the diagnosis i said no im just looking for answers in my life, i want to understand myself better and have those around me understand me a bit better. they then said they only test adults who are looking for disability. i wish they would’ve told me this before i could’ve already been looking for a different facility but i waited so long for this appointment for them to tell me they can’t even test me. i feel so lost and so incredibly mad i want to scream at the top of my lungs ;;;;
2025-09-17 04:55:06;Bullying, social anxiety, lack of self confidence and autism;"
I don't know where to start. All life I have felt like I don't belong. I always felt out of place, like I can never be 100% in the moment. I always struggled to make friend. I constantly feel like I have done, said something wrong. That my face or body is weird. I sometime feel like I am not even in my own skin amymore, I just drift of somewhere else.... Even interacting with my familly can make me feel nervous.

Sometime I feel like poeple are looking at me and it instantly make me feel repulsive, I wonder if my face is weird, or if I just walked funny...

Noise can be triggering and make me aggressive, like snoring, the noise my heater make during winter or people chewing loudly. I hate crowded space.

I was diagnosed 2-3 years ago with autism, but I wonder where do I draw the line. Do I feel the way I do, am I the way I am because of autism, or was it the bullying that shaped me. 

Because I was shy, alone and it was easy to make me cry, people bullied me. And many did. They called me retarded aka La Mongole. They used my name as an insult, mocked me, hit me, made gagging noise when touching me. Some days were opposite days, and during that time, they would say I was very pretty and they wanted to be my friend while the rest of the group giggled in the back.... I grew up with almost no friend.

I only ever dated one guy. I was 23 when we started dating and I just wanted to feel normal.... Our relationship lasted 2 years, during which he was aggressive at time. He would tell me he didn't care about my passions, shrugged and ignored me when I showed him the lingery I had brought. Today, 7 years later, I still wonder if I ever loved him, or if I just jumped on the first guy that showed me attention. 

I never dated anyone else since, and I feel so lonely, but at the same time, I enjoy being alone. I crave intimacy and am repulsed by it....

How do you know you are autistic and not just socialy akward or lacking in self confidence...I look nothing like the autism you see on tv.... I feel confused and lost.. There is so much conflict in my head and I just want it to stop....";;;;
2025-09-17 02:14:58;feeling sensitive about my communication and how it impacts others;"hey gang, i’m (23NB) new to posting on reddit and to this community. i think i’m just looking to hear others’ thoughts and possibly gain some insight/validation. 

both my partner (ba in psych) and therapist highly suspect that i am autistic, but i’ve not been formally diagnosed. i am very hesitant to self-diagnose, but i do find that i relate to the experiences of many autistic people and find some of the label to be validating in what i experience rather than hating myself for how i think/behave. 

recently i’ve been told that it’s distressing/invalidating/hurtful when i take up a lot of ‘space’ in conversations. that is to mean, i ramble a LOT. i’m an expert at taking the scenic route and can be liable to ramble on topics that aren’t even hobbies or interests, necessarily. (e.g. “did anything notable happen at work today?” turns into me going on and on about anything i remember happening during the day.) if this happens with someone who is less talkative than me at baseline, it doesn’t set off alarm bells for me if they become withdrawn/stop interjecting while i ramble. 

i’m having a hard time processing what i now have realised: regardless of why i am doing it, i am not making space for others in conversation, and it’s causing them to feel ignored. i also feel hurt because, in turn, it makes me feel like they don’t want to hear what i have to say. i can see factually how one person dominating the talking stage isn’t very fair, but i feel stuck rationalising that while also holding space for my own emotions. 

tldr; i ramble in conversation to the point of making others feel like a hostage to my words, and i don’t know how to truly feel that both parties are valid at the same time in their feelings—them in feeling ignored, and me in feeling hurt by being called out ";;;;
2025-09-16 22:28:36;I feel lost (half rant but need advice);Ok so I’m currently waiting diagnosis and throughout my life have passed multiple screening tests (the nhs is dumb) but never went further than that but I need to talk about this and i feel like this is the place. I feel the need to be told what to do not in a strange way I’m just so tired of being different I want to be told what to wear where to buy it what to eat how to walk or what to like what I should be doing i feel like I’m so far away from my peers and I can’t catch up I want things that I have to do to be fully explained but people act like I’m purposefully being dense but I am trying like my brain is working full speed on everything I don’t know what to do I’m 16 (ik that’s a “difficult age”) but i don’t feel like I’m experiencing anything like everyone else I’m in constant panic outside my house because i feel like i don’t know what I’m doing and everyone can tell and they can I have met new people and immediately they ask “do you have this” i don’t know how they know and i don’t want them to but i don’t know what i am doing that is different than them i ask my friends and they just say like don’t worry about it i ask again for a real answer and they think im arguing (and oh god why does everyone think im arguing when im not) anyway advice would be greatly appreciated ;;;;
2025-09-16 18:50:55;I really don't get what ADHD even is, the more i learn, the more i feel like it's just a bunch of unrelated random things in a trenchcoat;"For a thing called ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"" it:

1 - Doesn't make your attention span shorter, just makes your attention completely uncontrollable 

2 - Gives you social issues and makes you think differently, also making you mask like ASD

3 - Gives you executive dysfunction 

And apparently it also:

Gives you a tendency to pick skin, bite your nails, etc.

Also makes you hyperfixate on things like ASD.

Reduces dopamine levels.


**I'm professionally diagnosed with ADHD**, every single thing i learn about ADHD and neurodiversity seems to just describe me, but i have no fucking clue what ADHD even actually is, isn't it supposed to not be that much of a hindrance????

I'm starting to suspect i actually have high functioning ASD on top of it, because no fucking way ADHD does that many similar things, right..?";;;;
2025-09-16 17:46:24;2 years of allistic group therapy (psychoanalysis). A rant, I guess.;"Sorry, long post. Just felt like I need to recap and maybe get some external views. Ironically, this sort of discussion is not allowed in the therapy setting because it's somehow ""not emotional enough"", ""too rationalizing"", ""too methodical"", ""too complex"", ""too abstract"" (read: too autistic?) and whatnot. So here goes:

I've been in analytic group therapy for almost two years now. The backstory is 30 years of dysthymia and a few depressive episodes in childhood and adolescence, all untreated. The only interaction with health care professionals was a diagnosis of Asperger's at age 7 and a prescription for Ritalin (pediatrician + child psychiatrist), but the diagnosis was kept secret from me and I never got the Ritalin. I only found out at age 37 through a collateral history (psychiatrist interviewed my parents for Asperger/ADHD symptoms in my childhood).

Two years ago I went to my GP because my father said I seemed depressed. In reality I was doing better than in the previous 30 years, but I still had dysthymia. The GP prescribed antidepressants (since I had no psychiatrist and psychiatrists weren't accepting new patients) and recommended CBT apps (HelloBetter, Deprexis, Novego) because therapy slots were also impossible to get. SSRIs, SSNRIs, SNDRIs had zero effects nor side effects, and the apps were mostly relaxation exercises that did nothing for me.

After that I searched for a therapy spot for two years: 25 inquiries, 23 rejections, 2 wait-lists. During that time I had intake sessions with several therapists (CBT, psychodynamic, analytic). Diagnoses thrown around were mild/moderate depressive episode, dysthymia, social phobia, avoidant personality disorder, complex PTSD. Nothing about it felt episodic, I didn't have excessive anxiety, and there were no triggers, flashbacks, or fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses. Dysthymia seemed plausible, but I was the one who mentioned the term and the therapist basically just agreed.

Then I finally got a therapy spot: analytic group therapy. The therapists from the intake sessions had recommended psychoanalysis and group therapy. But it felt odd from the start. There's no structure or moderation. One or two extroverted members take up 90% of the speaking time. Sometimes the therapist will ask, ten minutes before the end, after 80 minutes of seemingly random anecdotes, ""So what's the topic, actually?"" - and then the session is over. Next session nobody seems to remember anything and it starts all over again. Yet everyone else reports feeling much better afterward. When we had a five-week break for vacation, the others seemed upset and sad in the first session back. For me it's mostly exhausting, because I want to contribute something meaningful but there's no shared communication protocol. I never know when I'm allowed to speak, what I'm allowed to speak about, or what purpose the others' stories serve.

When I bring up a topic, I get either silence, confusion, or misunderstanding. When I explained the concept of ""Wartemodus"" (German for ""waiting mode"", which I'm sure you're all familiar with), other group members turned it into ""Wattemodus"" (""cotton mode"") and assured me they also ""sometimes feel wrapped in cotton."" As if I'd asked ChatGPT something but made a typo and it hallucinated a new meaning. The therapist accuses me of being overly cerebral, of rationalizing everything. He constantly asks me what I feel. I'm not supposed to think it through, just feel. When I ask what that even means, I get no answer. He might as well tell me to ""taste numbers"" instead of doing math with them. When I try to give concrete examples, he interprets them ""psychodynamically."" If I say I feel uneasy taking out the trash because someone might watch or talk to me, he says it's because ""the household garbage symbolically represents the garbage in your soul that you don't want to bring out in public."" I do give him points for creativity.

Because of all this emotion stuff I first thought of alexithymia. The therapist didn't like that because (a) it's a fancy word and (b) supposedly an outdated psychosomatic concept. In his view I'm probably just avoiding feelings and hiding behind technical terms. Or something like that.

Still, that was useful, because I badly needed an explanation for why I feel like I'm observing a different species in this therapy group, and why the therapist seems to have no idea how my internal processes work. I found the explanation pretty quickly: Asperger's. Fittingly, one group member said ""Isn't that Asperger's?"" after I described some typical situations (without naming any diagnoses), which the therapist immediately cut off with ""No diagnoses!""

So I looked outside the group. Read a stack of books and dozens of personal accounts. Joined an Aspie self-help group. Essentially got peer reviewed. In that group I can talk without being misunderstood. There are clearly defined topics. You signal when you want to speak and then pass the floor, instead of interrupting. You ask if you don't understand something. You can even ask for definitions of terms without getting weird looks. Totally different world. I started exchanging long daily text messages with another Aspie. Meanwhile I searched for a specialist. After more than 50 inquiries I found a psychiatrist. Because of my legendary procrastination and incredible understimulation she suspected ADHD primarily, but she arranged an Asperger's/Autism assessment sometime in 2026 (or €800 immediately as a self-payer - great system). We're currently testing stimulants - unfortunately I'm immune to Medikinet (methylphenidate). Elvanse/Vyvanse is scheduled for October.

At least now I have a consistent explanatory model for myself. My self-image has shifted from ""basically normal but damaged"" to ""different and competent."" The dysthymia is gone. The procrastination remains, though :D

The question remains what to do about the group therapy. (Health insurance pays for roughly 2 years, but I could request an extension. I probably won't, so it would end this year.) I'm supposed to ""talk about things that concern me emotionally."" But not about diagnoses. And no technical terms. And no definitions. And no explaining what internal models I use to interpret emotions. And no asking how unstructured storytelling is supposed to improve anything. And absolutely no meta-level discussion. So basically I'd like to read out this post, but that would break all the rules ._.

The psychiatrist was baffled as to why an Aspie would be in group therapy at all - especially analytic. She recommends CBT instead. Similar feedback from the Aspie self-help group. Did I just pick the wrong therapy format? Looking back, this group therapy has been unexpectedly valuable for self-discovery, even if the path was anything but straightforward and rather frustrating.";;;;
2025-09-16 14:30:47;"Am I allowed to use the word ""masking"" if I'm not technically diagnosed?";"It's just that sometimes I truly truly feel like that's the closest word I have at my disposal to explain something I do all the time. I just feel like I'm different when I'm alone at my house. Like, *really* different. I don't do it on purpose, and I don't know exactly what or why that is, but I act so ""muted"" with my family, at work, on the street... that I legitimately feel like they haven't seen the real me at all. I came across the term on IG one day and I felt like it described what I feel normally but then I learned it's a term neurodivergent people came up with to explain some of their behaviors. And I would **not** want to appropriate a term that is like a big part of a community that's so misunderstood so yeah, would love to hear some of y'all.";;;;
2025-09-16 14:16:53;I was Neurotypical Until I Developed a Neurological Disorder;"I was neurotypical until I turned 16, when I developed a neurological disorder. Before then, I felt very aware and attached to my emotions. I did not need to question them; I simply felt, and that was it. A big part of my early teens, until I was 16, was my obsession with finding the perfect girl. I swear, I was falling in love every other month with someone new. It was great. Love is a very powerful thing. There's a reason why it is often compared to a drug. Because, like some drugs, it can make you feel on top of the world. That is how I felt. I could conquer the world, school was easy, and exercise was easy. My life was going exactly where I wanted it to go. Then, around the age of 16, it all changed.

I just started feeling off. I first noticed it in my energy levels. It seemed I was no longer able to keep up with my old fitness regimen. Over a couple of months, I tried and tried to keep a consistent pace. But soon running turned into jogging, then into walking, and then into not leaving the house much at all. I figured I was burnt out. After all, I had been hard at work for two years. However, after summer passed and I started speaking with girls again, something was off. At the time, I didn't quite understand, but I would soon find out I could no longer ""fall in love"" as many neurotypicals can do so easily. 

What was once something that would just arise from out of nowhere didn't seem to come at all. No more rush, no more butterflies, and almost no more interest. This led to a cascade of events that took me to nothing but dead ends. But when I had developed tremors in both of my hands, I finally had something to bring to the doctors. I will refrain from saying what, however, I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder. I felt the need to express my psychological changes to the doctor, and he explained that in rare cases, the software in one's mind can get corrupted in a way by the condition, and that was likely what I was going through.

I am now 22, and I am still adjusting. I no longer can fall in love in the typical sense. I remember what it is like; however, I no longer have the capacity for it. Not to say I cannot love at all anymore, I definitely can. But it is different; I do not feel the same for romance and sexual desire as I once did. I want companionship, but without the obsessive feelings I could have had before, it is hard. Essentially, my emotional spectrum has been dulled; I feel all the typical emotions, but I just cannot get excited anymore. I no longer feel an adrenaline rush from positive stimuli like music or intense scenes from movies. Overall, life is a bit more bland. 

Honestly, I am new to this community, and I come here to see if anyone has a similar experience to mine. I have never met anyone in person who fully understands what I am going through, and I do not exactly expect to find that here. But I do feel like if anyone would understand, I would most likely find them here. 

";;;;
2025-09-16 13:34:36;Talking a lot as a way of masking;"Recently I went on a trip with a friend. My first real ""outside activity"" after my diagnosis. In my daily life I barely leave my house and I'm trying to keep interactions with strangers at bare minimum as a way to save energy. 

But during the trip I talked a lot with locals and other tourists. I do enjoy casual interactions with strangers in specific moments but I'm starting to notice I don't know how to end these kind of brief chats and I end up getting caught in conversations just because I believe I'm being polite or don't want to sound rude. 

Just as an example, if I'm buying something and the person says something about the weather, I'll reply saying ""I'm glad its raining because my plants feel happy"", and it leads to a conversation about gardening.

I'm aware a lot of us rather be quiet and I notice my neurotypical friends know how to move on instead of dragging the conversation.
I'm aware my behavior comes obviously from masking. I don't recognize myself. That chatty person is not who I am. 

I want to know if anyone else reacts the same way and if they have any tips for ""deprogramming"". 

Feels like people sometimes are just thinking out loud. What the hell I'm supposed to do? Should I just not answer? Nod, and that's it? 

Now that I'm self aware I wonder if patience the key or if there's signs I can identify and keep my mouth shut and make life easier?

I always regret talking. But not talking is also weird, or maybe not? and I need to get rid of this concept.

Can anyone recommend a non-irritating short sleeve shirt that's a little bit more dressy? It can just be a t shirt with a ruffle, a short sleeve blouse, just send me your favorite comfy shirts for dressing up jeans on a summer day.";;;;
2025-09-15 22:16:44;Principle thinking;"So I don’t know if this has been answered here before, and this is my first time posting, but I was wondering what people’s thoughts are on what I call “principle thinking”. For starters, I was diagnosed with ADHD several months ago and my medicine I take does seem to help with my focus. But one of my main areas I struggle in is looking at the principle behind an action.

I use this thinking almost everyday with about every action. Specifically, in my job where we have policies and procedures that we have to follow. The bosses (who are dinosaurs IMO) have this mentality of “do as I say not as I do” and break the rules when it benefits them. But by god, someone else did exactly that and shit would hit the fan. I look at the principle behind that fact that we have rules/policies because EVERYONE needs to follow them, not just a select few. 

I also struggle with “black and white” thinking. I very rarely see a grey area in almost anything and some would describe it as “an extremist” viewpoint. If I feel as though I have been wronged by someone, that’s it. They are done, in my eyes. I won’t reach out to them, I won’t speak to them, I won’t associate with anyone they associate with. Doesn’t matter how long that relationship has gone on. Now it is different for certain people (I.e. parents & wife). But for the most part, if you “wrong” me, I am done with you.

I have noticed over the years that this has made me struggle with finding/keeping friends. I feel as though I follow a “blind loyalty” concept with friendship and when someone doesn’t hold that same sentiment, it’s not worth the effort to try and keep the friendship going. I dissociate myself with people who don’t think like I do, which in turn also hurts my relationships with co-workers and just makes my job harder. 

Does anyone have any insight into something I can do to help this? Or any advice at all into why I am this way or ways to help going forward? If it’s any consolation, I do see a psychologist once a month and she does help after the fact.

2025-09-15 21:14:41;Where to draw the line between autistic and NT?;"(Im not an english native speaker, sorry for formulations that might be a bit off)

Im a 36M, and during the last weeks i'm thinking a lot about my ASD diagnosis i got 10 years ago , after i've asked my GP for an assessment. I think it comes down to feeling like an impostor, because from the outside i appear very normal to most people, and i even have a rather successful career in IT.

Also the doctor who gave me the diagnosis told me after tests ""You can have the diagnosis if you want, seems like you are on the edge of the spectrum, if at all""

on the other hand there are quiet a few things in my life and especially in my past that fit pretty well to the whole ASD topic. But i'm also struggling with the distinction what really lies at the core of my symptoms.

I'm saying this, because i grew up in a rather isolated family, as the oldest kid. I did not have many kids to play with when i was very young. And my parents were also not very social people. So i think that what i'm experiencing could just originate in the way i grew up. being bad at socializing, and always lacking behind in sports could also come from the fact that i never learned how to do these things as a young kid.

On the other hand, my family has a history with depression and mild tics on the side of my Dad. Especially the first topic affects me also, second just a bit.

Because of this i'm constantly wondering, if it is just my depression (that is currently pretty ok) or my family dynamics that make me fit the spectrum and not ASD after all?  But who can really tell?  Of course all these diagnostic criteria are made by humans, and have no absolute truth to them.

Also disorders are often (or always) diagnosed because the person is suffering from them. My suffering is very small. It has been bigger as kid - but today im fine.

By this definition i would probably not qualify for it.

I know that this community can not give me something like a seal of approval, but nevertheless i would like to share some pro and contra points with you, that come to my mind, and you could share your opinion on, if you would like.

Pro ASD:  (as far as i can tell)

\-Motor problems as a kid. I went to therapy for that during primary school, as i was still walking on my toes around kindergarten, and was pretty bad (but not unable) to catch balls during PE.

\-I do have photos of myself as toddler, where i was stacking various objects, and holding my hands in stereotypical manners.

\-My kindergarten teacher wanted to put me in a special ED class, as i was not interested so much to play with the other kids. My Parents disagreed.

\-Since my early school days, i have mild tics regarding pulling my eyelashes and ripping off parts of my finger- and toenails (most people seem not realize it, though)

\-I also was a very picky eater. Some textures or even noise some food makes (biting an apple) almost made me vomit as a kid (sorry for being so graphic)

\-i was always a very fidgety person. from kindergarten up to today. sitting down without moving my legs a little, or playing with my fingers is hard for me.

\-Of course i got bullied

\-I had my first panic attack with 12

\-Depression diagnosis with 20. Since then, i never really got rid of my SSRI.

\-I Have synesthesia (numbers have colors in my mind and other properties, for example)

\-Intense special interests about certain fandoms and topics like fossil and mineral collecting

\-Bisexual

\-Listening to some extreme form of metal, helps me calm down. When im alone also tend to stim (rocking helps me with focus when i need to read a complex text alone in my room)

\-Also also alone, i tend to do some form of echolalia - talking to my self in some nonsensical way.

\-I still sleep with plushies, as this calms me really good and feels nice.

\-I like structure a lot. I organize my life primarily through to-do lists and calendars

Contra ASD:

\-I function very well

\-Normal language development

\-I have a job, and got married

\-No, aggression, no outbursts or shutdowns

\-I am able to suppress stimming, echolalia, tics etc.

\-I am socially acceptable, but find it demanding.

\-I got a nice group friends. But they are all pretty nerdy.

Thanks for reading this and your opinions.

EDIT: 

Of course, my parents totally disagree with me being autistic. My Wife indeed sees it in a more nuanced way. 

And, i also tend to have hyperfocus on some things, and issues to focus on tasks that are not that interesting.";;;;
2025-09-15 13:59:56;Can you be autistic if you get sarcasm/metaphors?;"I get sarcasm and metaphors really well, but I still have trouble talking to people and don’t feel normal in any type of interaction with people I don’t know, I’ve had this since I was very little. After social interactions now I feel very numb, like for example, I worked part time this summer and I felt glazed over and frustrated leaving work everyday. I’m a woman, if that matters because I know it presents differently for girls.

I scored very high on diagnostic screens, so I’m not sure what that means, not saying that it’s an official diagnosis. ";;;;
2025-09-15 07:52:57;Argued with my coworker yesterday;"She has tormented my mind for 7yrs. I worked with her when I was 15, and was basically non verbal. She constantly made comments even to customers about things like ""I love people who talk a lot, I just don't get people don't talk"" and things like that, and yeah i can't prove it was directed at me, but it always made me feel bad.

She would also ask me to do things and ye she is my superior, but so was everyone else, only she did it in this rude and disrespectful manner. I've now witnessed her treat new girls that way too, and one time abt 5yrs ago, she swore at a girl who had just lost her mum from heart attack like 2 months ago, but came in to help us work on mothers day (probably do distract herself) this coworker swore at the girl and yelled at her rlly nasty, because she told the boss that she was smoking in the work room that had no ventilation, and i was also in there at 16 at the time along with a few other 15-17yo girls, and the girl who told the boss was like 21, and the boss is this coworkers (let's call her Ann) Niece, so its not even a big deal to tell her. Plus 21yo girl first asked Ann multiple times to not smoke in there.

That was the main occasion that just printed her character on a sheet for me and I can never look past that.

Then when she was going through a divorce she decided to take it out on me who could hardly speak, I know the fact I didnt talk made her frustrated by me more easily. This one day she kept being disrespectful, like at the time I was religion, and would pray abt once in the work day, which the boss allowed. So I asked her when was the best time I can pray and she said ""at 12"" so when 12 came I said ""you said you want me to wait until 12, so is this a good time?"" And she is like ""don't act like you waited till 12 for ME, say the words ""I"" want to go pray because 12 is a good time for ME, don't say 'SINCE YOU SAID 12 IS GOOD FOR YOU' as if ur doing it for me"" and I just didn't know how to vocalise a response to that so i didn't. But it rlly rlly bothered me, I know the bigger issue was the issue I couldn't speak up, but it was still her in the wrong who took advantage of that.

She would then ask me to help her do fiddly things cos she couldn't do it, then would keep telling me ""can you hurry up?""

Days that i forget to plast on my smile early in the morning she would flick in my face and say ""wake up"".

Just little disrespectful things.

I ended up leaving that job, and came back cos the boss is rlly nice and she offered me a better job there.

I was unemployed for a year and ig in that time I discovered masking, past a smile. I was homeschooled/isolated as a kid btw so only when getting that job was I faced with a social situation.

So i got the job back, masking as high as i could. The mask fell a but as i got more comfortable with them, but the mask falling for me simply means talking less and sometimes forgetting to 'look happy'

Either way, still, I talk like a semi normal person now, but still struggle to go ""off script"" or express emotions.

My boss has previously encouraged me to speak up to Ann instead of keeping it all inside and i explained to her that I cant control my emotions so the day I speak up, its not gonna be in a calm, polite, or joking way. I don't know how to passive aggressively express my emotions or however else ur supposed to do it in a professional setting. I warned her one day I will snap, and I am inclined to having psychotic breakdowns in similar situations with people at home who i went through the exact thing with until the day i snapped.

Yesterday she was trying to explain to me to do a task differently, but it frustrated me because she always said that but I don't rlly understand it, cos she contradicts herself often, so I questioned it. I didn't yell, and as far as im aware I didnt talk in a bad tone. I just questioned her suggestion to try to understand and ig somewhat expressed my frustration in the fact I couldn't understand. I think my tone was frustrated confused, but idk. 

She then snapped saying i been arguing with her lately, just cos I expressed to her last week that I felt she didnt trust me, when she asked if I told a customer something and I said I did, and she said ""well how come I didnt hear you?"".

I snapped and yelled at her and she kept saying ""no be quiet i dont wanna do this"" and im like ""no, we r doing this, you have disrespected me for 6yrs, there comes a point a person breaks. You giving me advice isnt a problem, you saying in arguing with you because im starting to attempt to have a voice is what angers me, because you tell me to speak up, but you clearly liked it when I just let you step on me"" She is like ""no youre right, i do want you to speak up, im glad youre speaking up, thats good, i want you to talk and have a personally, ur not a peice of trash"" and im like ""exactly, you think im a peice or trash with no personality because i struggle to speak"" and she is like ""no"" then went off topic abt 101 times to tell me all the good things she does, how proud she is of me and etc.

She IS NICE TO ME, and when she is, i am nice back, how is that an excuse as to why i should let her disrespect me? She kept going off topic to tell me good things she has done or complimenting me as if that has anything to do with what im saying. I kept saying ""I feel like you're not even hearing me"" but she would repeat the same dang things, like ""im just giving you advice to be a better worker"" and i said so many times ""i know, thats not even my problem, when you give me advice i say thank you, I didn't understand your advice and it frustrated me because this particular thing you tell me to do, you often contradict yourself, so im left not knowing how to improve, so I questioned it. I only got annoyed that you perceive me asking question or trying to understand, or SPEAKING, as arguing""

We stopped and she later got upset and said i hurt her feelings because she never wanted to hurt me, and she is worried im seeing a psychologist bc of her, which is almost laughable cos I've Never even had the chance to talk abt her at my sessions.

I don't feel guilty at all that she is hurt, cos i frankly don't care. A part of me almost wants to, but I just don't. 

I know some of the issue is in me ofc, cos I let that anger build up, and now she only sees now, while I see 7yrs of build up.

I know she has respected me more in recent years, but I also speak more in recent years, so i know her respect is tied only to how well I speak.

My boss told her b4 that she suspects I have autism and Ann brought it up to me to say I definitely don't, cos she has a 4yo nephew who is autistic and he is basically non verbal.

When I was basically non verbal at FIFTEEN for like 3 years, very very slowly improving, and she will refuse to accept i might be autistic, but she will still judge me for not being 'normal' I hate people who refuse to acknowledge I might be autistic, and argue ""but you're normal"" but im only normal when a possible diagnosis comes up, but in every day life they constantly make me feel abnormal. 

She will tell me I don't speak, or dont understand instructions or etc etc, but will refuse to even consider that i may be autistic, and even sounded offended that my boss suggested it, and I agreed when Ann brought it up to me. She seemed offended that I didnt reject the idea but rather said I'd long suspected it. Because its offensive to her 4yo nephew who she pitties so much it makes ke uncomfortable, and he can speak sometimes ""when he wants to"" and he IS FOUR.

Don't know if anyone will read all that, but if u do. Just someone saying ""I relate, ur not crazy, valid crashout"" would help. Thank you.

2025-09-15 04:25:25;I got assessed when I was 10 for autism but didn't get diagnosed. I read my report for the first time today to find out why I didn't get diagnosed. It didn't give me an answer.;"So I've suspected I was autistic for over a decade at this point and for the past few months I've become comfortable self-identifying as such. But I was confused why, despite being assessed for autism and despite the fact that everyone I know seems to think I am autistic (I know that my parents, my twin sister, three of my close friends, and a former occupational therapist of mine all think I'm autistic), I did not get diagnosed. I read through the report, expecting some sort of explanation as to *why* I didn't get diagnosed, and there was none! It's pages of detailed accounts of my behaviours, including details about how I struggle with social skills, sensory issues, and restricted interests, and yet in the conclusion, and I'm not exaggerating here, it basically goes ""yeah she has symptoms but she doesn't meet the criteria"" with *no* elaboration as to what criteria I didn't meet. It's so frustrating and my parents also share this frustration but they decided to not try again because they didn't see the point (I am diagnosed with dyspraxia and was receiving support for it, so they didn't see the need to continue pushing for an autism diagnosis even though they disagreed with the evaluator's conclusion). It's wild how they can just refuse you a diagnosis with no explanation given.";;;;
2025-09-14 16:04:00;Special interest or normal interest?;"Hello, I’m 15F and for now Unofficially diagnosed with high functioning autism.

Yesterday I was watching a video on youtube “5 signs that you might be autistic” so there was one part that was about special interest.

It explained that autistic people tend to have certain interests that they can obsess over, I completely understood that, but then, it also said that autistic people tend to often stay awake for hours, forget to take care of themselves and well basically unhealthy stuff just so they can spend time on their special interest.

I didnt relate to that, not that I know at least. So I started questioning if the couple experiences I’ve had were actually special interests or normal stuff that neurotypical people experience.

Back when I was 6 I became OBSESSED with horses. I watched a lot of shows and movies related to horses (exemple : Spirit and Horseland), I bought a lot of figures and plushies, also books, each time I crossed pathe with an horse I was super excited, even ended up begging to do horse riding (Stopped after one year because of a bad fall). It lasted for about 2 years.

Then when I was 9, It was wolves. Again, I watched lots of movies, shows and documentaries related to wolves, I read a lot of books (sometimes fictional stories but mostly books to learn about wolves) and at some point I knew a bunch about wolves, even convinced my friends I was a werewolf and would go live with wolves when I’d be older…. I was a little weird but let’s not talk about that. It lasted till I was 11 (I still love wolves tho)


I have some other experiences but I’ll stop with those two. What do y’all think?";;;;
2025-09-14 06:51:06;I’m burned out when it comes to socializing;"I don’t think I was ever the kind of person to people please because I already knew at a young age it wouldn’t work out. I did think I would find my place to fit in one day. However, I now feel like it’ll never happen. 

Growing up it seems as though people approach with these unspoken expectations and get mad when I don’t subscribe to it. People would want to be my friend at first but then get mad when I speak. I’ve been told that I was better silent and some girls decided to stop being friends with me because I wasn’t talkative enough when others were around (like  10+ people). I try to just do my own thing but it never works. Some people just want to talk to me only to be disappointed. 

I never knew what I was doing wrong and it always felt so isolating. Like no one understood  me. My mom knew I was diagnosed with Asperger for years never mentioned it until I got into an argument with my siblings one day. She then said “leave her alone she’s autistic” I didn’t know what it was. It went over my head for years. It wasn’t until I met my bf I started realizing it affects me far more than I had noticed. 

I feel very resentful when I think about the past. I’m naturally a kind person but people think it’s something to take advantage of. So I have to be a bitch to get respect. I’ve had 2 different therapist and they would always confirm I’m not the problem and I need to assert boundaries. I do that respectfully and directly and they take it as a joke. So I have to be a bitch. Then they leave me alone. They don’t expect me to defend myself so it comes as a shock to them and then they feel intimidated by me.

Im sick of people. I just want them to leave me alone. It seems that’s too much to ask. They don’t like me but they’re always in my business. Always talking about me or to me. Then complain to me as if I’m supposed to drop everything and change for them. I want to them fuck off. It’s really annoying to have to be a bitch when it’s not like me. I don’t want to make friends anymore. I’m fine with just my bf and maybe a cat. 

People would say “don’t think like that”. As far I see it’s the truth. I’m a black woman and I don’t fit the stereotypes about what a black woman should sound like or act like. I’m hyper feminine and been that way since I was a child. Black women aren’t allowed to be timid, soft spoken, and feminine. I’m not supposed to like any other music besides rap, hip hop, and rnb ( I do like those genres but that’s besides the point). I am attractive and that’s why people are always in my business. They take my social awkwardness as me being arrogant. I’m not supposed to be book smart because again I’m black and I’m attractive. Black and attractive means I’m supposed to be a total air head. 

Also because I’m a black woman im supposed to be an open book and put every one else before me. They want me to be open so they compare themselves to me. I’ve had alot of jealous friends and people around me. I basically get told everything about me is wrong. So I don’t like the idea of having people in my life now. I will never fit in. I can at least be tolerated by smart people. That’s the only place I was left alone. They noticed I’m different they just don’t give me shit for it. So yeah fuck the world I’m over it. ";;;;
2025-09-13 22:47:22;Big feelings about diagnosis;"Hi everyone. I'm 44 years old and was very recently diagnosed with Autism (also previously with ADHD and ""Giftedness"" whatever the hell that means). I am highly successful in a very niche career and have a wife and children I have a good relationship with, so it is very hard for people to understand why I even sought a diagnosis. I am an expert at masking. I can be anything for anyone. But it costs me so much. 

I have dealt with suicidal ideation my whole life. Substance abuse is off and on an issue for me. I feel so exhausted all the time and have for years. I don't even know who I really am, or what I even want in life, I'm so busy trying to be something for everyone else so they don't think I'm crazy or weird. 

I thought having an official diagnosis would make me feel better, and I guess in some ways it does. But mostly I feel sad and alone. I just feel empty. Like every part of who I am is autism. My whole personality is just masking. The few parts of me that people think are cool and that I always thought were unique about me, don't seem cool anymore to me, just autistic. I guess I'm learning I have been taught to be ableist and I have more negative feelings about autism than I thought I did. 

I know there are stages to this, and there is a lot of grief. My therapist calls it ""Relief and grief"" getting a late diagnosis. I think it will be ok, but right now it's just really awful. I don't totally know why I'm sharing this, I don't think there is any advice that would help right now. Maybe someone who is going through something similar will read this and feel less alone. 

EDIT: Wow, I really didn’t think so many people would be in a similar situation. You all have really helped me today. Thank you so much. ";;;;
2025-09-13 07:55:56;Not sure if it's social anxiety or autism (or both);"I've had anxiety my entire life and have diagnosed social anxiety disorder, but the past few years I've been really starting to think there's more to it than that. I recently started my first corporate job out of school (after working part time freelance for a year) and I've been really struggling, mostly socially. I'm constantly fumbling social interactions at work and leave every day feeling so exhausted with my eyes glazed over. I'm convinced that my awkwardness makes people uncomfortable and that I come off rude most of the time. I find it so difficult to connect with people because I just don't know how to interact with them. 

I have a lot of autistic traits but there are also things that make me really question it. For example, I feel like I'm constantly acting in social situations and none of it comes naturally to me. I don't know how to keep a conversation going or respond to practically anything anyone says to me and so I'm silent most of the time. I do however know how to read social cues and in fact I think I'm overly sensitive to them. I can almost always read how someone is feeling and notice the smallest changes in someone's behaviour (although I'm sure I miss things). Does this mean it's just social anxiety or could I be high-masking? 

Some other traits I have: I'm highly sensitive to things like sounds, lights, touch. I'm hyper aware of how much eye contact I'm making and I time how long until I have to look away. I definitely have special interests but I'm not sure they are to the point of hyperfixation. If I'm not interested in a topic there's basically no hope of getting me to talk about it or interact with it though. If I have a meeting or phone call I have to make a script for it otherwise I completely blank and forget everything I was going to say. I've also always tried my hardest to blend in with others and mirror their behaviours and ways of speaking. I feel like I don't have my own sense of identity because of it. 

Back to the exhaustion - I very recently discovered what autistic burnout is and it literally made my jaw drop. The past 2 or 3 years I've been dealing with really intense fatigue on and off (but mostly on) and my doctors and I tried so hard to figure out what's been going on. All my tests came back normal and so I was diagnosed with ME/CFS. What really struck me was the similarities between burnout and CFS symptoms, and so I'm starting to think I'm autistic and have just been really struggling trying to live a neurotypical life. 

I'm curious if anyone else has a similar experience?";;;;
2025-09-13 00:32:06;PDA & Lack of Routines/Structure?;"So, I have very few routines, but I've been diagnosed. I have a lot of imposter syndrome-y feelings around that because of the stereotypes around expectation sensitivity and craving structure. If anything, my structure IS a lack of structure. I have a 'getting ready for the day' routine that's basically sacred to me, but that's kind of it. It's an uphill battle to create structure within my life and I feel helpless to create a healthy lifestyle/habits. This has been a thing my entire life. Any time I feel like I don't have control over my life and I'm doing things for other people rather than myself, I'll practically destroy my own life just to get control back.

Can any PDAers speak on routines/structure and what their relationship with it is?

Additional context/questions:

1. ""Not"" AuDHD, just autistic. I realize there's a lot of overlap between PDA and AuDHD specifically, so I'll get ahead of that by saying that my assessor specifically didn't think ADHD made sense for me, in spite of having a lot of traits that seem very ADHD-adjacent. Fact is, every time they tested my attention, it was within normal limits, and I don't match up to the actual criteria nearly well enough to be diagnosed.
2. Today, my new therapist brought up that I have an Oppositional Defiance streak about me, so I talked a bit about that and how PDA feels like it makes more sense to me. I still can't really rationalize how PDA makes sense for someone who has been such a people pleaser though, along with a few other things that don't really fully fit. If anyone can speak on this, that would be great too.";;;;
2025-09-12 23:04:08;28M — Thought I was broken my whole life. Now I think I might be autistic. For the first time I feel relief… but also terrified if I’m wrong;"I’m 28M, grew up with an abusive narcissistic father, and spent most of my life feeling broken, unstable, and like a fraud. Two weeks ago, I started suspecting I might be autistic. I took multiple tests and all pointed strongly toward autism. For the first time in my life, I felt relief like maybe I was never broken, just different. But now I’m scared…

I am writing here because I am highly confused and don't know what to do. I just want to hear your opinions and discuss if it is possible.

I had a rough childhood and now have been in therapy for almost 2 years. I was abused by a narcissistic father. 

I always thought I was broken inside, my brain not working like other people and I was crazy inside. as a kid always thought that I was mentally unstable and had problems. 
and it is true I mean I was mentally unstable how couldnt I be? I have a suspicion that I may be Autistic and I am almost certain at this point but I also feel like a fraud when I think of sharing this with closed ones and fear what if I am making these up? what if I am a fraud like I have been my whole life (I feel like I play characters when in social situations and feel like they are not me and that I am manupilating people. I am going to write in more detail later in this) 

I am going to write some times of my life historically because it may get confusing otherwise (I think and also I get confused if I dont write it that way)

I was a happy kid as I recall. I was silent. had a high pitch unusual laugh that always made people stop and look at me. when I talked to people and got excited I couldnt breath properly and therefore couldnt talk properly. I had things and still do have things I find funny that confuse other people.

older folks always told that I was a nice silent kid. I didnt talk much to them, I think this may be because I was afraid of authority figures because of my dad. my dad was the worst. he had rage all over. didnt get anything I say and tried to empose his way of living to me.

there are some textures in food that is disgusting to me like eggplant,okra etc. I also cant stand the consistancy or smell of yoghurt although people say it doesnt smell at all. I cant wear anything wool or anything that has a collar, it makes me highly uncomfortable.

I didnt have my private space as a kid and I hated it. I always wanted my room to stay as it is didnt want to change a thing yet my mom would change a place of a chair or my bed and I would get angry so much.

I always had to watch my father and act accordingly to how he is feeling. I listened to his voice and tones of his sentences very carefully. If I heard a laugh I knew it was okay to come out. but any sentence even if he is in a good mood gave me a fear that he could be angry or in a bad mood. I couldnt tell the difference unless I hear a laugh. it may be because he always speaks very loudly.
I always was obsessed by rules. I couldnt even break a very little one. 

I always got in trouble sometimes by saying the wrong thing by not knowing it was a wrong thing to say. people would get upset. and most of the time I couldnt get a chance to explain myself.

I heard a lot of times from my friends that they avoid me meeting their other friends cause and I quote ""couldnt get along with them."" this upset me very much because I didnt know what was wrong with me.

I cried a lot. I mean a lot like all the time and it was seen unusual. had a very very low tolerance for pain, a little touch or a pinch would hurt me really bad and my eyes would water immediately.
With my friends I wasnt really silent. I was energetic.

I stimmed my whole life. I get parts next to my nails bit off constantly. I made scars on my legs my scratching. I cracked my fingers. touch my fingers in order back and forth
I had some OCD like if I touch one part of the fridge I have to touch otherside. if something has surfaces that are seperated. I had to touch all of them if I had touch one. I later got over it (I mean I still have some but not a strong urge to follow through) by touching one side and not touching the others no matter how unconfortable I get because I wanted my brain to be less broken.

I walked with the outter sides of my feeth and by curling my toes stepping on them.

I always analyzed a lot of things and tried to get what is life? why everthing and how everything is happening. what people are reacting to and what they are not. what seems to be get friendly attention? which body movement or state shows about a human being what they feel?(read all the books about this that I can find)

I started acting at the age of 10. when I first got on the stage and then at the end when everyone applause, I felt amazing. I got obsessed with this and now I am a professional actor/director(also write like... a lot) spoiler alert!

I got bullied a lot but also liked by some people I am grateful met pretty amazing people in elementary school.

middle school was a nightmare and I recall very little from that period of time. I had a best friend who was good with me I liked him a lot. but he made fun of me humilate me when we were with other people. I had 2 good friends I spent my whole time with. they were both geeky types that has special interest and highly intelegent and know so much about spesific things so different from the rest. now when I look back I am almost certain that they were on the spectrum(there were other signs too)

highschool was good not at first because since I still cry (like a lot...) I guess at highschool you shouldn cry that much so I started to try not to cry when I get the urge. after some time it worked and couldnt cry at all for like 15 years I was totally emotionless (I could cry again after a while when I started therapy now I apriciate I can cry and human again)

I made myself characters, took a lot of behaviours from people. when some people that I hang out with on different places come together they would be suprised that I was a different person from what they know me of.
I learned how to be funny. I mean really. I analyzed jokes that are funny. how to tone each word. a stop between certain words make it more funny and how long should be that stop etc. I analyzed everything mathematically.
I felt like a fraud. but in theatre I was more like myself(even if that was a thing idk what is myself). ""people like me"" I thought untill I learn they secretly hate me and talk sh*t behind my back. I was really heartbroken.

I was more in character in social situations from that moment on. I repressed all my insticts and started to observe and then act. I occasionaly skipped school my letting my mom know that because I couldnt break rules though still was feeling bad about it because you know... I was breaking the rules.
I wanted to go acting school (conservatuary) but my father didnt let me. I started studying mechanical engineering by making an agreement with my father ""I will go through with this but as I graduate you have no say over what I do for a living"". he agreed but was still thinking he would control me anyway(I mean he tried). it was soooooooooooooooooooooo difficult times. I rocked the classes like coding or design I was the top of my class. but the other topics was not getting my interest at all and I had really hard time focusing.

I tried to do acting in university but they didnt let me in I thought, ""this is what I want to do with my life and people dont let me!"" they told me I could help out with technical issues but not with acting.

I didnt talk to anyone just went to classes then went home. I didnt have a character there and I couldnt communicate with people. I didnt know what character I do would make me bound with them.

I started taking acting classes in a famous academy with school at my second year of university. I was finally feeling like I am home. I felt like could communicate with people more. I had more friends then the university I had been in for a year vs this place for a day.

in 2 months I had made into the main cast. was crushing any role I was given and I always were obsessed to learn more and more to get better.
after some time I graduated from my education in acting I kept getting cast in plays and in a couple of years I was director's assistant and was directing plays for kids (played by adults noy kids)

this is where everything went south so bad. my character as an actor there didnts work well as a director at all. I had to be an authority figure now. I had mad anxiety. trying to get what everyone feels and act according to that while trying to direct a play.

this time I remember getting a blank brain (thats what I call it english is my second language so I translated directly what I call). Blank brain is when I get my brain blank. like pure white sheet of paper, can't think, barely can talk.

after some time I was so hopeless so I started therapy (best fkng decision I did). I got over my social anxiety that I thought got over (because it was easy to act around people as someone else but still felt like a fraud you know...).

I left theatre it was becoming more difficult I couldnt feel the spark anymore. I mean there were times that I enjoy it so much but still. I was making myself do things by force.

I discovered things that triggered me got better, got worse, got better eventually I was more in balance with those things. I felt more comfortable around people and dropped all my characters to be myself, to get more genuine connection with people as purely myself, not as a fraud, but guess what? I still didnt know how to communicate.

I felt more comfortable when I was with people but still felt like an alien. I tried hard to communicate and felt like a different person everyweek and that scared me but still I thought it is a process of getting better. I didnt have an answer to the question ""who are you?"" I started oversharing, like I would meet a person and talk about my traumas, my father then think to myself ""why did I say these I just met this person.""

I started working as a director/writer in a production company. I was having a hard time getting what they expect from a project so I failed bunch of times then I started to get better(because I started doing things as I feel not as I was told) and people were happy with my performance. I started to run the place in a year. but they didnt kept the promises and I felt betrayed and said ""we cant work like this"" and got fired.

leaving a place I am working is very difficult for me. almost feel like impossible. when I started in production company I was highly anxious then when I got used to it felt better, change my role in company it was high anxiety all over again.

Before I got fired. At that point(also now) I was ""appereantly"" very cold person. I was trying to be a nice person but people often called me cold and I was suprised.

I had no facial expressions or a character, I seemed depressed all the time even if I felt good with myself (as much as I can be).
I started to act as a character at work to be accepted by people and it kinda worked because it wasnt like before. I was also trying to be my authentic self. act as how I felt.
Now I got 2 very close friends(know for a fact one of them is on the spectrum). I am upset that I am not close enough(cant be because I dont know how). I feel so alone always felt this way no matter how many friends I have because I have some things inside me that are ""crazy"" ""insane"" ""broken"" that no people in their right mind would want to be friends with.
its been 6 months since I got fired and I feel so much better. but still not so much because still something was wrong with me and I was trying to fix.

2 weeks before now I started to suspect. I might be autistic. It made perfect sense and all the dots connected. and in 28 years of my life that was the FIRST TIME that I didnt feel broken and give up trying to fix myself. start learning to live with my different way of thinking. be more understanding.
but there comes another feeling. ""what if I am not? what if this is a defence mechanism to make me feel normal at last? what if I am faking it? what if I am still a fraud?"" the things I have written here are 100% truth. I tried to write everything that came to my mind but there are 4 times more of this I am sure of.
I tried to be normal my whole life but now if I am really autistic that makes me relieved that I was normal all along. for 2 weeks now I am researching everything about it my whole day with just a little sleep even if I am really tired because it bugs my head. I want to be certain.
I read a book on self diagnosis, I did any test I could.

-154 on CAT-Q
-32 on Autism Quotient (AQ-50)
-147 on RAADS-R
-154/200 on Aspie Quiz (%100 probabilty of being Autistic/Neurodivergent)
-207/235 on Monotropism (My avagare 4.40)

I did bunch of more tests but these are the results I have got screenshots of.
I talked to my therapist about all these things I have written here and she said ""yeah seems like it"" but she also said if it will make any difference to get an official diagnosis? and I said it scares the hell out of me to be wrong about this.

also I dont have the financials to get an official diagnosis anyway I can barely afford therapy (its one of the things that is the most important to me because its for me being better)
sorry for such long text here. I just need opinions not be schooled about how I need an official diagnosis (I researched enough to know official diagnosises are wrong and I dont know if some doctor that doesnt know me would get me and my high masking skills, I am an actor so I think it would be tricky for them)
any opinion is fine since I had A LOT OF trauma, if you think I am in denial, if you think that I am trying to make myself see myself as autistic because it really felt right and felt like I belonged but I hadnt felt good in years and this might be the answer if it is not true I think I will just get back to trying to fix myself idk what I am going to feel.

I think I am over most of my traumas and gone a long way in years.";;;;
2025-09-12 22:19:05;Taking autism traits to literally or being used to them?;"Hello, I’m 15F and unofficially diagnosed with autism.

For the past few weeks ive been experiencing imposter syndrome a lot and earlier I thought about something: What if I was just to used to my autism traits and think they are normal when they arent? What if when I read about autism traits I simply took them to literally and thought I didnt have them?

Could that be possible, and if so, what do I do?";;;;
2025-09-12 20:30:53;Am I autistic or just introverted?;"Being around other people is uncomfortable and exhausting. It's difficult to connect to people because I don't care about the things they care about and it's difficult to perform conversation when I can only draw a blank on appropriate responses. I feel alienated from social conventions and propriety, but I do them for other people's sake.

I'm 36 and male, I've never been diagnosed with anything, I just go through life alone because I figure that's what suits me. I have been wanting to make some changes recently, though. I started taking an online class , but I notice that I don't connect to my peers very well during our discussions. I also started online dating last year, but the few women who seem interesting to me won't talk to me. But I can't pin my dating struggles on my social struggles until I get a better job.

I just started wondering if I'm autistic this morning, but I can't tell if it would matter to find out the answer. I wouldn't be ashamed to find out, but I wouldn't be relieved either. I might like connecting to other autistic people, but I'm not sure. I'm inclined to think that the reason I think everyone is boring is that I live in Indiana.

2025-09-12 08:11:48;Autism Is Not an Epidemic: Recognition Is What’s Changing, But Many Systems Are Sliding Backwards;"Hey all, this is my first time posting to reddit. I am an autistic adult with, what I believe to be valuable insights and experiences that could spark helpful and productive conversations within and beyond the autism community. Being late diagnosed autistic working in the ABA industry, I've seen how autistic children and adults are viewed and mistreated. I've witnessed/experienced the lack of education preventing us from proper care and support, and I feel passionate and dedicated to educating the systems that are preventing us from flourishing in a world not designed for us. My goal is to not only open these conversations and educate others, but I'd love to make a career out of this. Please let me know how I can go about reaching the right platforms and people to bring up these matters.

Here is my article, ""Autism Is Not an Epidemic: Recognition Is What’s Changing, But Many Systems Are Sliding Backwards"":



Autism has always been part of the human population. The rise in autism diagnoses does not mean more people are suddenly autistic, it’s because diagnostic criteria have broadened, awareness has increased, and stigma has slightly lessened. Many individuals (particularly older adults, women, and people from minority backgrounds) who were previously misdiagnosed, institutionalized, or overlooked are finally receiving recognition and diagnosis.

Recent US research confirms this: between 2011 and 2022, autism diagnosis rates increased significantly in all age groups, but the *largest relative increase* was among young adults (ages 26‑34), and among females, compared to males (Shaw et al., 2025). This suggests many adults are only now receiving diagnoses that likely should have come much earlier.

Yet, even as adult diagnosis increases, support systems remain heavily weighted toward children. Most governmental policies, insurance coverages, educational laws, and therapeutic services focus on early childhood. Adult autistic people often face an abrupt cliff once they age out of school‑based support. Critical services like speech or occupational therapy, employment supports, daily living assistance, and mental health care become harder to access, more expensive, or not covered.

Meanwhile, in many places, children’s resources are also being limited. Insurance companies, Medicaid, or similar governmental programs are placing caps on hours or years of therapy, tightening “medical necessity” criteria, or reducing coverage based on perceived function or severity. These limitations often reflect ableist beliefs about what counts as “enough” disability or dysfunction, rather than focusing on what accommodations people actually need.

One widely used therapy, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), has been praised for helping some children develop skills. However, humane, ethical, and community‑led critiques are growing. Many autistic people report that ABA *can* be abusive or traumatic, especially when it prioritizes compliance over autonomy, suppresses natural behaviors (including stimming), fails to respect sensory or communicative needs, or is used without sufficient input from autistic individuals themselves. The community and recent scholarly work (e.g., “Affirming Neurodiversity within Applied Behavior Analysis”) argue for integrating autistic voices, the neurodiversity paradigm, and careful reflection about what “treatment” means.

A particularly harmful force in this system is masking (also called camouflaging): when autistic people hide or suppress autistic traits to fit into neurotypical social expectations. Masking often requires immense effort, constant vigilance, and emotional energy. Over time, it leads to heightened anxiety, depression, and burnout. Studies show that in autistic adults social camouflaging correlates with worse mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression), increased suicidal ideation, feelings of thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness (Pérez-Arqueros et al., 2025). Autistic burnout is a real, often unrecognized crisis state. In the UK, for example, autistic adults are reported to be up to *nine times more likely* to die by suicide than non‑autistic adults; autistic women even more so (House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee, 2025).

So although more adults are being diagnosed now, there are enormous barriers: cost, lack of providers who understand adult autism, long wait times, difficulty getting insurance or services to accept adult diagnoses, and the fact that many adults have masked for so long that neither they nor professionals recognize the full spectrum of their challenges.

Given everything above, the question governments should *not* be asking is, “why are the numbers up?” Instead of productive questions, some leaders also describe autism in alarmist terms. While discussing with RFK about the “autism epidemic”, President Donald Trump recently said, “The autism is such a tremendous horror show” (Trump, 2025). Our leaders should be asking: How do we make education, workplaces, healthcare, and community life more accessible for autistic people of all profiles? Because right now, most systems are designed in ways that harm or exclude autistic people - from schools with rigid expectations, to workplaces that don’t tolerate sensory differences, to healthcare that doesn’t understand autistic communication.

We must recognize that children’s rights, access to education, and opportunities for justice are being undermined. Services are being capped, and the therapies that are offered often lack consensus on best practices or are guided by ableist assumptions. Children who don’t fit old stereotypes of autism, such as those who are nonverbal, have different sensory or learning profiles, or whose traits were not reflected in diagnostic criteria historically centered on boys, are increasingly marginalized because resources are limited and insurers rely on rigid thresholds.

Ableism, both in language and in societal assumptions, is a major barrier to accurate understanding of autism and a key reason why education, services, and supports for the autistic community remain inadequate. For example, terms like ‘high-functioning’ and ‘low-functioning’ autism divide individuals into arbitrary categories, diminishing their real needs and often limiting access to appropriate supports and accommodations. Such labels reinforce the false idea that autistic people can be neatly grouped by ability, rather than recognized for the full diversity of experiences, strengths, challenges, and needs they face. These ableist ways of thinking do not stop there. Labels and assumptions made by allistic people continue to shape policies, education, and societal expectations, causing lasting harm to autistic individuals’ learning opportunities, autonomy, and overall quality of life.

The cumulative effect is devastating. Autistic people (adults and children) are being asked to carry burdens we did not choose: to mask at the cost of our own well‑being, to hide our communication styles, to suppress our sensory needs, to conform to norms built without us. The weight of survival is too heavy.

Why This Matters

Governments and institutions are not only failing to catch up, many are moving in the wrong direction. The lack of education about autism, the rollbacks in access to resources, the focus only on childhood, and the growing disrespect for adult autistic experiences are taking us *backwards.*

We are expected to live in a society designed by and for neurotypical people - one that does not truly accommodate difference. But a humane society meets its people where they are. Until policies shift from “Why are diagnoses increasing?” to “How do we protect, accommodate, and allow autistic people to thrive *at every age and profile*,” all the talk about rising numbers will be empty.

This is not just about awareness, it is about justice. It is about ensuring that all autistic people can live without the crushing weight of masking, without being told their needs are excessive or unjustified, without having their experiences and needs overlooked or devalued, and without losing access to therapeutic support before they even have a chance. Although we are far from the understanding and accommodations the autism community deserves, we can hope for a future in which our differences and strengths are recognized as assets to society, rather than dismissed as a ‘tremendous epidemic’ or a ‘horror show’. If we truly care about humanity, we must choose inclusion over ignorance.

2025-09-12 05:52:53;Change in plans (those plans are staying home);"I have not been diagnosed with autism, so lets get that out the way. I have had suspicions my whole life though. In addition to that, a medical professional that works with autistic people highly suspects that I am autistic. So, I'm taking that and running with it.

I recently went on a midweek trip with my wife and while it was lovely, I was anxious the entire time. I have in fact been diagnosed with GAD/Panic disorder and I believe that's probably a side symptom from the tism.

It was all lovely but I could not wait to get home.

In online autism questionnaires, I've always answered no to the ""I get uncomfortable when my plans change"" as I don't care when plans change until I realised that my plans are ""staying safe at home"" and then I VERY much care when those plans change.

Like, what is to be done about that? I've got a holiday coming up soon and I'm terrified about it. Not because of the plane or anything, I just am.

2025-09-12 05:14:50;Would there be a benefit to seeking out a diagnosis?;"Hi everyone,

Disclaimer: There's a lot of rambling here so feel free to skip to the last paragraph for the gist of the post.

I've been struggling with my mental state for a little over a year now. In the last few months especially, I've been put in social situations where I just simply wasn't able to cope or felt completely isolated from everyone around me. Whenever I feel like I've figured somebody out, they change how they act, and I can never figure out how to adapt. Some of these situations have caused me to resort to unhealthy coping strategies, and on the whole my emotional regulation abilities have plummeted. Basically, the highs feel a lot less high, and the lows feel a significant bit lower. Because of this I've started to question in earnest whether I have autism or not, and looking back at my childhood it would make a good number of things make sense.

Part of my concern with seeking out a diagnosis is that I'm honestly not convinced I have problems in any meaningful sense. My girlfriend, who was diagnosed as a child, seems confident that I have it and is a lot of the motivation behind this question, but she also has a history of being overly hasty in throwing out mental health labels. Additionally, it's hard for me to say whether I'm really 'masking' in conversations or if I'm just socially awkward and uninteresting. I've seen some posts recently talking about how people are labelling themselves for the sake of looking quirky and I really don't want to do that or devalue the situations of people who deal with autism.

The main reason I'd consider getting clarity is because I often feel lost with who I am, and I would hope that confirmation in either direction would help me understand myself better. At the same time, I'm concerned that I'm currently trying to subconsciously act like I'm autistic to justify the fact that I'm a failure. I've grown up in a setting largely removed from obstacles and trauma, so it's possible there's really nothing wrong and I'm just too lazy or boring to successfully converse with new people or handle things like emotional stress or loud rooms in an acceptable way.

I'm aware that it's impossible to say whether I am autistic or not from one post, but I would like advice on whether looking for a diagnosis would be helpful or not. I saw a post earlier today mentioning that it just made them more confused; I'm not certain whether I can handle more confusion at this point. So, from your experience, did an official diagnosis (particularly one later in life) help or hurt your self-image? Is it worth seeking one out even if their would be no material benefits? Thank you to all who answer \^\_\^";;;;
2025-09-12 01:04:04;Related to autism or not?;"15F unofficially diagnosed with high functioning asd

Soooo when I get frustrated/angry I tend to feel like biting stuff, or throwing stuff, or hitting stuff. Last time I felt like that I bit my own arm and ended up bruising it….

It’s different from my meltdowns (where I usually feel like I’m completely losing control), I can calm faster but yeah, I find that extremely embarrassing to be honest, I feel like a spoiled kid that is overreacting or something ";;;;
2025-09-11 23:11:06;Does anyone else feel they act differently after the diagnosis?;"I’m diagnosed with AuDHD and before my autism diagnosis I noticed I had much more personality, I would show emotions and interest more and I guess you could say I felt more present. Lately it’s felt like I just want peace and quiet all the time, I zone out entirely, I can go almost all day only saying a few words to my family until my adhd kicks in and I randomly get this need to talk about everything at once. I am more irritable, I have much less hope for things, I’ve just felt like a shell of myself the past month or so. I can’t tell if it’s because I’m losing the mask or if all the research i’ve done this past year up until the diagnosis has made me understand myself better and now i’m just more in tune with how I am, I have no idea, all I know is that I feel like a completely different person now and i’m actually not sure if I like it. I get aggravated more easily, I don’t want to leave my comfort zone for anything unless I have a random spout of adhd spontaneity, I just want everyone to stop talking, i’m not as interested in sex, I feel much more “emotionless” the majority of the time. I have always had these traits but they usually only show up as a situational response or in spurts, now it’s all the time. I literally do not care for society at all, i’ve almost completely lost my will to give a shit about working, I just want money to be able to eat and buy things I’m interested in. 

I don’t know what’s going on with me but it hasn’t been good for my motivation, everything has been significantly more difficult since my diagnosis and I was wondering if anyone else feels the same. ";;;;
2025-09-11 22:59:43;What if autism is just evolved zoochosis in humans?;"I (28F) want to preface this theory by saying I am autistic. I’ll try to explain as clearly as I can without sounding insensitive, so I am sorry in advance if this comes out a little clumsy!

In animals, *zoochosis* happens when they’re caged: pacing, rocking, overgrooming, repetitive routines, eating issues, disconnection from their instincts. If you know anything about autism/adhd and other neurobiological disorders, this should sound somewhat familiar to you. These are traits and behaviors that can be observed in people with ASD. So...

Here’s the rabbit hole:

* Autism wasn’t really “documented” until around 1799—right when industrialization was taking off, though society had already started shifting in the 1400s/1500s.
* For most of history, we lived communally in agrarian, nature-based societies. Autistic traits may not have stood out, or may even have been useful, or maybe didn’t even exist.
* It wasn’t until a couple hundred years ago (or even more recently) that we started living in small houses, working rigid jobs, and boxing ourselves into industrial life.
* Once society became industrial, standardized, and disconnected from nature, these traits became more common and prevalent, which correlates with the uptick in diagnoses. (I know the evolution of psychology as a science also contributes to this)

Over generations, what if that stress response became genetic? Autism could be an evolved form of zoochosis—a survival adaptation written into our DNA as humans boxed themselves into modern life.

Recent studies suggest genetic markers for autism are found on the X chromosome. This may explain why AMAB people are diagnosed more often—while AFAB folks, with two X chromosomes, have a sort of protection. (Though we also know diagnostic bias plays a huge role since criteria were built around young boys.)

Other conditions often found alongside autism—OCD, anxiety, trichotillomania—also echo this theme of being trapped in environments that don’t fit human nature.

So maybe autism isn’t a “disorder” at all. Maybe it’s just what happens when humans live too long in cages of their own making. Maybe autistic people are actually *more adapted* to the environment we created.

I know autism looks different for everyone—it’s a spectrum, and there are always exceptions. But when I go outside, walk, sit under the sky, I feel at peace. The stress lifts. Just like a captive animal calms when returned to nature.

So what if autism isn’t brokenness? What if it’s evolution’s way of showing us the cost of our cages?";;;;

2025-09-11 19:33:34;Is anyone else super uncomfortable with your actions being commented on?;"I'm not sure how to explain this exactly but I'll do my best. I was diagnosed with autism at 19 and I'm almost 22 now. I also have a lot of mh issues going on, just for background. I've recently noticed that I get super uncomfortable when people comment on what I'm doing or how I look or sound, even when the comments are completely harmless and mostly positive. I got engaged to my boyfriend 3 months ago and every time he says something like ""that looks good on you"" or ""I love it when you do \[insert thing\]"", of course I appreciate him saying that but there's always some discomfort in the back of my head.

I've started to wonder if it could be PDA related because my brain somehow seems to translate ""a person I love likes it when I do this"" to ""I must now do this more"", which makes it seem like a demand and therefore stressful. I've wanted to start a conversation about this with my fiancé but I don't know how to word it in a way that DOESN'T come off as ""I don't want to hear any comments from you ever"", because that's not true at all. I appreciate hearing those positive things, I just wish I understood what happens in my brain when I hear said comments and where that vague discomfort stems from.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Could it be autism related or is it caused by something else? Or do I just not like being perceived?";;;;
2025-09-11 08:36:04;i think i have autism;"(PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE SHARING ) now i would say aspersers but from my love of holocaust history i found out from my friend thats not an appropriate thing to say.

i do not say this to be rude nor to demean anyone. I have done immense reaserch trust me ive watche multiple videos from physcoligists and read many atricles, even though i dont ussually like reading in general! ive also took many online tests that would say that i have very high likelyness that i have some form of asd but as explicitly said many times it was not a formal diagonosis, which to be honest is not what i want i do not want a diagnosis, however i do crave answers to why i always felt so different?

like how i would always hate loud envoirnments and how despite my love for trains growing up (its a cliche i know but this was long before i even understood that autism wasnt only people who were nonverbal and was only around 8) i couldnt last a minute on bart without my skin crawling from the loud noises that lasted all the way until even now when i take the bus everyday to school (im a sophmore) and i can barely take my headphones off even though theyre not playing any music. obsesiveness has always been a big thing too from the raw age of 6 years old when my mom first taught me about the holocaust while my older brother was afraid i was very interested even now ive watched so many videos read articles (AGAIN I DONT USUALLY ENJOY READING) and movies/shows.

the same standard for dinosaurs and marine life almost every inch of my room is crawling with pictures ive drawn and photos ive ripped from books of different marine life and lastly aside from those major obssesions a more widespread and minor i am quite interested in media and movies

monsters inc and pixar to sitcoms and deep movies paranorman whom i relate to so much it can be in its own seperate post i often find myself comparing my real life to movies and most the time im not the one who knows it its the people around me. like ill often refer to my freshman year to season one. its honestly so embarassing and makes me feel like a loser. It reminds me of abed from Community.

But i am not abed for one i am a girl and feel like i am so very similar to him but also quite different, well not as much different as somethings i relate to him as is like toned down where he may be seen as hallucinating a different reality in christmas wonderland i dont ever get that bad.

but aside from that and many other things like my poor social awearness and my often either sensory overload or deprevation, meltdowns i have frequenbtly (THAT ARE SO EMBARASSING) and burnout (one was so bad it sent me to psych)

anothet the biggest thing that makes me belive i may have asd is that when i was ammited my freshman year to the pysic ward a pysciatrist put in my file she suspected i may have it but i didnt get an official diagnosis i only got one of depression i belive and that was it. I am open to any opinions and ways to look wether i should think this what the next steps should be or if im crazy its all in my head and should leave it behing me thank you for reading this and please leave what you think";;;;
2025-09-11 07:26:02;having a partner with autism;"i’m diagnosed with bpd and bp while my partner/fp is diagnosed with autism and adhd, and i believe that it’s something we can handle, but as of now we’re in a long distance setting, and i find it hard to sometimes navigate on what to do when one of us is burnt out or having an episode or overwhelmed. 

i’m the type to want to communicate anytime i’m free and when he’s free, but right now he’s experiencing an autistic burnout, this has happened before and i feel like i took it well, but every time it happens i still feel like it’s difficult to handle, he mentioned that one of the things that could really help is to hold him and comfort him, however, since we’re ldr right now, the only thing i can do is give him space. it’s probably easy for other people, but for me it’s so hard because we only get to talk a rarely and it’s so so difficult for me because i really miss him, but my priority is for him to get better over my wants and needs. 

my world revolves around him, whenever he’s happy then i’m happy, whenever he’s not okay then i’m not okay as well, i’ve been trying yo work on it, but my emotions gets in the way and it just sucks, i love him with my whole heart and i’m scared of losing him, he’s the only one that’s keeping me from doing anything harmful (which sounds absolutely bad to others, and maybe it actually is, but that’s just how my brain works) BUT i’m also trying to change that for the better because he had partner who would sh in front him and it left some sort of trauma and i don’t want him to experience that with me, i want him to be happy and comfortable with me. 

i’m bad with expressing myself so i feel like the words are confusing, but my main point is that im having a hard time to handle things because my emotions and feelings are based on how he’s feeling, i don’t do anything that can harm him any way and i always put him first

i know it sounds so bad, but i promise you guys that im trying my best, i can’t lose him, i love him too much. 

please someone give me their thoughts on this";;;;

Hi guys! I would really appreciate your advice or opinion on this situation. 
My uni teacher is autistic: she was very open about her diagnosis from the start, she mentions it pretty often and jokes about it often as well. She does tell us a lot about her life in general - different life stories, her opinions on specific things and such. 
Me and her have pretty warm relationship. We often talk outside classes, exchange compliments and thoughts, and she’s always happy to see me according to her own words. 
Recently I was considering possible career in teaching. I’m also determined to try and get official diagnosis when it comes to autism, but I’m a foreigner, so I don’t really know how it works in this specific country where I’m living now. I wanted to ask this teacher about those two topics (what’s her experience with teaching while being autistic and how hard it is to get officially diagnosed here), but I’m not sure if I have a right to ask that or would it be considered rude or too much? I don’t want to create an awkward situation or damage our relationship, so I would really appreciate your help🤍 ";;;;
2025-09-11 02:05:50;how do i know it was autism, or dissociation/depression?;"i had a therapist suggest it a while ago after i was diagnosed with adhd by a psychiatrist. adhd pretty much explained why i cannot pay attention for shit, no matter how hard i try.

but there’s also the fact that with autism i didn’t really have many symptoms i can remember, aside from stuff that can be adhd.

it feels like the symptoms suddenly onset at like 9/10 years old, when life got super stressful? i just couldn’t relate to peers, nobody wanted to be friends with me, but i didn’t feel i was nearly as lacking in social ability. yet in most other environments, i made friends.

but the friends i did have, i couldn’t relate or connect to them. i can’t tell though if this is bc of trauma. i had an extremely stressful, chaotic household by this time. i just didn’t have the same concerns or problems as them, all i wished for was peace and some semblance of normalcy. i couldn’t speak in my home, i couldn’t be a kid, the best solution here was to lay low. this simply was not the case at before— i tried to be well behaved but i did also test boundaries etc.

at some point i just never felt anything at all and that was my life, but i know it is because i *couldn’t afford to*. eventually i had so little interest in my peers that i just couldn’t recognize when they were being kind, or trying to get close. their problems and feelings didn’t make any sense to me, as my own didn’t.

frustratingly, i also *knew* what feelings were appropriate, but i *just couldn’t feel them*, this actually still makes me frustrated and confused when it happens sometimes lol, eventually i just stopped trying. edit; it feels like executive dysfunction but for feelings. you anticipate it and then it just doesnt happen, like it fizzled out or something.

i can’t tell if it is autism or just that i retreated into a bubble for survival and seriously just couldn’t relate to others in my life. i feel less like that now that my problems are “equalizing” with others’ in adulthood, given im lucky enough now to not have to worry as much abt my physical safety bc i cried or something.";;;;
2025-09-10 17:49:03;I feel like I am a very boring person;"I am an aspie and was diagnosed last year. I feel like most people find me boring, maybe because my topic is very narrow, so like my colleague or friends would avoid to talk to me one on one, maybe because I am very boring and always run out of topic to talk about since I have super narrow interest.

Is any other aspie also face the same issue where people avoided us because of our very boring topic?";;;;
2025-09-10 13:33:52;If my body doesn't feel like working should I listen to it or ignore and push through?;"I'm a man who just turned 32 years old. I self-diagnosed at 27 and I truly believe I am on the spectrum. I have done hand flapping since I was a child, jumping when excited, repeating my favourite lines out loud, scared of germs, hate loud noises like vacuums, I have a lot of empathy and I am quite fragile emotionally... you get the idea. Then found out I possibly have ADHD inattentive with it.

I am trying to get my life back together and be an independent adult like everyone else. I've been living with my parents since birth, and regular jobs does not work for me, and believe me I tried.

I want to be some kind of freelance artist/entrepreneur, either creating art for people, or making things that people would want to buy. I am quite good at creating things, but I never really earned money, there's a side of me who doesn't believe I can do it. I grew up with a narcissist mother and she would constantly compare me to other kids to make me feel worthless.

Almost every day is a struggle, and I do not understand. I don't work, I can sleep any hours I want, I can eat when I want, I can go outside, I am free, yet miserable. I want to move on in my life and progress but it feels near impossible. I think it is because I am in such a rush to make money, because if I do not work on my projects then I haven't been productive that day, and if I haven't been productive, then I've let everyone down, myself included, and it becomes this never ending cycle.

Recently I've watched videos, like Mel Robbins, and a few of David Goggins, and I was starting to get used to the idea that in life we have to push ourselves because the mind does not want to be uncomfortable (which is true.) For example, people with jobs they don't want to go to work but they still go because they have to, or else they won't be able to pay the bills or get fired.

Am I supposed to put myself in that category with neurotypical people? Would it make it worse if I do not listen to my body and just push, and push, even though I feel tired, even having dark thoughts at times when I am having a meltdown?

There are days that making art is like a big NO! But other times I am happy to do it and can work 5 hours or more, it just depends what kind of day I had. Yesterday I mowed the lawn and it took about 40 minutes, and then not long after I made a batch of spaghetti, I was not feeling like it because it's a lot of work, but I did it anyway.

Today however, I've noticed I wasn't feeling well, I slept 5 hours and I had no energy, I was not sick but I was sneezing constantly because of allergies, I went to play some No Man's Sky but couldn't go on because I was sleeping on my chair, I went back to bed to sleep another 4 hours, and I was still tired! Now it's 1:28 AM and I am okay to play something but not to make art.

I've been a gamer all my life, and gaming is a way to recharge my batteries, but society says gaming is a waste of time and we should work even when we don't feel like it. Which side should I believe? I am clueless what to do.";;;;
2025-09-10 06:53:47;I need help from people with partners with autism;"throwaway account because I figure I'll get a lot of dislikes but I don't know what to do and there aren't resources for this kind of thing. 

I love my partner. I have ADHD and I'm on the autism spectrum but not enough for an actual diagnosis (per my doctor). So I'm not neurotypical. 

My partner has bipolar disorder and autism. I generally have a LOT of patience, I'm usually super flexible. I know that because of their autism they \*have\* to be the ones in control and they cannot accept change and no one is allowed to confront that. It's annoying but if that's what she needs then I make it work. I don't complain. I don't criticize. I only offer full support without arguing. 

  
But their refusal to let someone else make decisions or allow change is ruining our household. Here are the three main issues:

Dishes.  
I know everyone fights about dishes. But here's the thing: I WANT to do the dishes. When my partner leaves for more than a day like for a work trip, I immediately get to work putting all of the dishes into the dishwasher, clean them, and put them away. However, I have to do this in secret because my partner believes that the dishwasher doesn't clean dishes. So she fills the sink with water and ""soaks"" the dishes for days, weeks at a time. If I attempt to put them into the dishwasher, she has a fit. It results in our kitchen smelling of rotting food and soiled water. We have flies all over our kitchen, crawling over every surface, and neither of us can cook or even leave food in the kitchen.  (They only recently allowed me to buy fly traps). It's bad. 

I'm more than willing to do the dishes - I'm begging to do them. But she will have a fit unless they are done HER way.

The Clutter.  
We moved in together two years ago. I was unaware that she is a hoarder. She won't acknowledge it, but we don't have access to our dining room, living room, or office because it is covered floor to ceiling in... crap. Most of it is from her grandparents when they passed. She took almost everything from their house. All of her grandpa's clothes. Oil paintings of her grandparents families (if you've seen Schitt's Creek... yeah like THAT painting). A railroad crossing sign some friends left at their house when they moved. Six bouquets of dead flowers (I get really uncomfortable living in a space with dead things). All of their CDs from birth to now. A full wardrobe box of clothes from twenty years ago. Three boxes of their ex's late mother's personal items, her ex's diplomas, and her ex's winter wardrobe. 

Obviously, this is all very overwhelming to do anything with. I have tried so many different ways to offer to help them. But they get overwhelmed very easily and give up. Or they get very upset about the idea of not having these items in the house. But they're getting destroyed by sitting in these piles and we don't have access to three rooms in our home. I've asked over and over if I can organize things into boxes so she can put them in storage and go through them one at a time. I promised not to throw a single used tissue away. But the idea of someone else being in charge of this is too much for her and she shuts it down.

The Google Document.  
We have a Google document to keep track of important household things. But it's not organized and it's over thirty pages. I asked if I could organize the pages and put them into an organized Google sheet. Nothing would be deleted. But they threw a huge fit - screamed at me about how I want to change everything and I'm destroying their memories. Yes, this is in regards to the Google document and ONLY the Google document. But because we've had the Google document for over 2 years, they have ""memories' attached to the document. Furthermore, they refuse to let me make the Google sheet because they said ""You always get to make the Google sheets."" I genuinely don't know what this is supposed to mean.

  
I'm so stressed. With my ADHD I do better in a clean and organized environment and currently, our home and Google document are causing me a lot of physical stress and making my life overall harder. I understand that she can't understand that and I try really hard to okay with this. But I am so stressed.

I'm asking for help from people who may have gone through this. What did you do? What \*can\* I do? I don't want to overstep an autism boundary but I can't keep living like this.";;;;
2025-09-10 06:10:07;I think I may be autistic but I just need other’s opinions/advice;Hey so this is my first time asking a Reddit question but I actually need some other opinions on this. I’ve noticed in myself lately that I seem to have symptoms of being on the spectrum (now I don’t want to rush into a self-diagnosis, hence why I’m asking this). But it’s becoming a problem and I don’t have anyone to talk to so hopefully someone will on here. These are the things I’ve noticed in myself: I pace and clench my hands over and over for no reason (I don’t know if this counts but I chew my nails a lot). It’s hard for me to make eye contact with people as I’m getting older and I don’t know why. I hate going to large social gatherings because it’s exhausting. I would have these large temper tantrums like a toddler even though I’m way past that stage (like screaming, hitting stuff, breaking them, slapping my own legs until they bruised). That was all over getting a C on a test. I have this weird feeling of something or someone inside of me wanting to get out but I can’t release it. Throughout my life I’ve been called dramatic or sensitive because I “care too much” and I just wish people would take me seriously (I’ve also been called selfish and rude, not realizing what I was doing was considered that). And whenever I feel or taste something I don’t like I twitch my face all weird and clench my hands over and over (it’s embarrassing, honestly). I just don’t know what to do at this point but hopefully I can get some advice here. Please help!;;;;
2025-09-10 00:00:11;Does anybody struggle with feeling like they are seen as having no struggles?;"Yeah, so I’m AuDHD. I got ADHD diagnosis as a child and the autism diagnosis at 30 because I was so “high-functioning” nobody noticed. My family life has also been as dysfunctional as hell so I have CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. Yet I’m high-functioning. Yay. 

Yes, I clean myself every day. I have worked. I can read people well. I have a high verbal intelligence. I am great at writing, words, history, and learning languages. I interpret social situations for my other autistic friends. I have close friends I mostly made in college because most people in grade school couldn’t stand me. I have a boyfriend. I’m closer to all of them than family because my family looks down on me and even discussed putting me in a home at some point. People might think this means I don’t struggle, but I do. I wish people understood that. 

I have struggled with finding and keeping jobs. I have had to learn how to be a real friend and lover to my boyfriend/unofficial fiancé. I learned from faith and therapy and my chosen family how not to believe the abuse and have self-esteem. I have been leaned on too much as the stable one especially by lower functioning friends. I am tired. I wish people understood that. ";;;;
2025-09-09 14:33:21;Might have Undiagnosed Autism but might also be making it up? Help? *Long*;"Okay. So it's a long story of how I got here and I have about a million questions. I've known for a long time that I have anxiety and sensitivity. When I was in elementary school, I was always the shy quiet kid. (I'm (17F) currently.) The sensitive one. My whole school years has been a struggle for me to talk to other people, mainly in big groups. Teachers would get frustrated when I would sit/stand in silent terror when I was asked to do anything from read a sentence out loud from a book to answer a question to give a presentation. My mom was very adamant (for good reason) that I learn to speak up for myself. 

It wasn't that I didn't want to talk. There was just something about people that made me shut down. It frustrated everyone around me. 

Fast forward a few years and my mom became very invested in learning about trauma and mental health. And I don't remember exactly when but I think around this time, I began going to therapy. I don't quite remember if it was for the reason stated above or the medical trauma I have around needles and doctors. I shutdown (completely unresponsive and non verbal) and it takes about an hour each visit just to get shots. Afterward, I'm completely overwhelmed.

It feels like I've been to every therapy my mom can think of and nothing seems to help. I've done talk therapy, EMDR, tried Brainspotting, and done the homework. The only thing that seemed helpful was Internal Family Systems Therapy. I don't see anyone for IFS but my mom does and the language surrounding that helps. 

I also thought for a while I might be HPS which fit a lot more than just anxiety but I always felt like something was missing.

Anyway! Last April, me and my younger brother (12) got psychiatric assessments. I basically got diagnosed for GAD and medical trauma (insanely helpful and enlightening) while my brother got diagnosed with low-support needs Autism. 

This is where the story really begins. 

I knew a little about Autism. I have a cousin who has high-support needs and is mostly non-verbal and my mom has told me a little about the spectrum but I didn't really understand. At least not until my mom dropped off the book *Unmasking Autism* by Devon Price and told me I might be high-masking. 

At first I thought it was ridiculous. I was nothing like my cousin or my brother. And I was a little skeptical of labeling myself something when I had just gotten an assessment that basically said I wasn't. I was always told to trust the doctors. Mom said that girls commonly get misdiagnosed. 

So, I thought, why not? I tried to read the book. 

I got frustrated. I know there are a lot of stories about Autistic people who get bullied or are that ""weird"" or ""quirky"" kid. This didn't really apply to me. I was the kid who flew under everyone's radar. I was invisible. I don't remember getting picked on a lot. I was the girl who was polite and quiet and got straight A's and loved learning. It was hard to read all these stories about older adults who got bullied and found out autism was the reason because it didn't sound like my story. There don't seem to be many, if any, teens who find out they might have autism. Only young children or adults.

So there was no way. Not in a million years. 

But part of me wondered and so for two straight weeks I researched. I read articles, visited the national mental health sites, took many autism assessments (which basically said I had *some* autistic traits), and scoured reddit posts and instagram reels. I don't think it wasn't that I didn't want the label. I *did* want it. For years, I could never explain to people why I shutdown or hated loud noises or certain foods or always had a hard time with small talk. It explained practically everything. 

But I'm sort of afraid I'm making it up. I know there are some people who pretend to be autistic and a lot of other people who see a mental disorder or illness and immediately assume they have it. I don't want to do that but I also don't know what to do. I don't want to talk to *another* therapist or *another* psychiatrist or really just *another* person that won't understand or try to make it something else. 

Regardless of whether I have autism, I do mask. A lot. Empath was a term I usually use to describe myself. I can go into a room and immediately sense what other people are feeling. They don't even have to speak. In high school, it's *exhausting.* I use this ability to attune myself to another person's frequency which basically means I just morph my energy to match other people's energy. I don't know if it's quite scripting but I do say specific things on a hyper awareness of the other person to make them more comfortable??? It's hard to explain. 

I use a heightened, empathetic awareness in order to deal with conversation. Social conversation makes no sense to me, I've realized. I hate small talk. The ""How are you?"" question is so awful. The answer is either good or tired and I hate both of them. My heightened energy sensing tells me what a person expects from me before they voice it. I think that's saved me from gossip and conflict. I'm a chameleon that reflects the energy people want. Sorry if that's a little spiritual. 

I have begun to try to not do it. I think it hides my bluntness because whenever I let it down, I say whatever pops inside my head and it usually offends someone. I have no intention of offending someone but somehow I do and I don't get it. I think over the years I've picked up on what *not* to say.  

The big thing is sensory stuff. I'm an extremely picky eater. Crunchy things are my favorite but juicy and gummy things aren't. It's caused a bajillion nutrition problems. Certain physical textures are also terrible like grass (which I have in common with my brother), and certain fabrics. I also hate loud noises. Unexpected crashes, loud music at dances, general background noise of lockers and people talking, high-pitched screeches. I've started wearing earplugs in public because it's so exhausting and I feel like it's just getting worse now that I've noticed it. Smells from people like perfume and cologne are awful too. 

I fidget/stim a lot too. When I was younger it was thumb sucking and now it's hair twirling which drives my mom absolutely nuts and skin picking. I also wonder if tapping rhythms is one that got missed because my family is extremely musical and so things like that are normal. I hadn't realized how much I do it until I started paying attention. 

My mom was the one who figured out my special interest and my hyper fixation. Reading. Writing. Books. Stories. I'm a huge reader, writer, and film maker. I love stories and I'll completely lose track of time writing for hours. It's my safe place and if I don't get to do it, everything feels like it gets really bad. I could talk for hours about movies and shows and books and why the characters did the things they do. I *love* tropes and archetypes and everything about it. Condeluded story lines are my happy place. I've spent *years* researching and reading everything about stories.

Anyway. All this to say that I'm not sure if I have autism. I don't know what all this is and I'm really looking for a place to explain why I feel so different. Medical Trauma doesn't seem to explain it all and neither does simple anxiety. Autism is the closest I've gotten so far. Any advice would be incredibly helpful. Should I try for a diagnose? Am I reading too much into all of this? I feel really lost. Sorry this is so long!";;;;
2025-09-09 09:50:24;I think i (25f)!have Audhd but my bf (26m) who is diagnosed asd is confident that i dont;"I dont really know how to explain how im feeling without rambling. I was diagnosed with adhd a few years ago. I've always had a really hard time relating to people or making friends. I tried to meet other people with adhd, to meet like minded people, but they usually distance themselves from me after i try and be myself. I've always felt like i was trapped in a glass box, and i can see everyone around me and they can hear me, but i can't hear them. And ive gotten better with reading their lips and body language but its exhausting. I wish i knew someone who was really like me. I just want to find somewhere i fit in. 

The closest i ever found was my bf, we are fairly compatible, but we aren't the same. I asked him once if he thought i might have autism, since he claims he's good at recognizing traits and symptoms and i explained that i have alot of the symptoms, and i always score in the very likely category when i do those online tests. he says no, that autism is more than sensory issues and meltdowns, which i already know, but i also mask around him all the time, not cause i don't feel comfortable around him, its like an involuntary thing, and at the end of the day i guess it doesn't really matter, im still me with or without any formal diagnosis. I just wish i knew why i can't make friends or when i do, end up as the butt of the joke, or why i feel so lonely and othered.

I just want to fit in somewhere and find someone like me. Maybe this is the place, i always seem to lurk here when im looking for social advice, but i don't know how he would react if he knew i wanted to see a psychiatrist for it. Maybe he'd think im copying him, or trying to be something im not. I don't want to be perceived as one of those people on tik tok who thinks they have something cause they saw some videos about it. I don't know if putting in all the work to seeing a doctor is worth it. I just feel like if someone could say ""here, this is why your like this"" then i could breathe a bit, and begin to compartmentalize my mind and feel less like a big angry squiggle. I feel bad, all the time but i don't know why. Its not depression bad, or anxiety bad. Its just this never ending mantra of ""somethings wrong with you. Your not right."" And anytime i tell someone they laugh, or they dont get it, or they tell me everyone feels like that. But if everyone felt like this, then id have more friends, rather than a long list of people who thought it was funny to make fun of me cause i wouldn't realize. 

Does anyone here get what i mean or have any advice on how to feel less bad, or how to make some friends? Should i see a doctor? How should i go about telling my bf about that, since he'd inevitably ask questions and i don't want to lie. If anyone wants a list of all the reasons I think i have audhd i can list it in the comments. ";;;;
2025-09-09 04:18:34;Have you escaped autistic burnout? How?;"Not sure if that's what it is and I'm sure many of you know a lot more about AB than me. But maybe someone can relate. 
For over 7 years I (w33) feel like I'm fading. Firstly, my lightness. Then, my sharp humour. With that, my confidence. My spontaneous thoughts. My ability to speak fluently. My capacity to form opinions and interests. 
LWhere there was masking once when I didn't even know what that meant, today there's just extreme fatigue in social interactions and hopelessness and self disgust. 

Since I'm new to the diagnosis I have never had coaching related to autism and all the other therapies never quite touched the core of the problem: the feeling that there's no one behind the mask. 

Is that burnout? How did you cope? Did you rehabilitate? Please give me some hope.

Thanks in advance, your thoughts and advice mean the world ❤️";;;;
2025-09-09 02:12:19;Is a diagnosis even possible at this point;"I am a self-suspecting 15F who's been suspecting for two years already. I have researched about autism and interacted with people who are autistic, and I am personally very sure that I have it. I'm also the daughter of two parents who would never accept such a thing within their family (My cousin is a high support needs and nonverbal teenager, everyone treats him like an inconvenience).   
  
I know that if I were to hypothetically get an assessment, my parents would also need to be questioned about my childhood. I fear that they are unreliable narrators. My father has never been a big part of my life. He's there, but he's basically never home due to work and other stuff. I was basically raised by my mother alone.

My problem is that I don't trust my mother either. She doesn't know me as much as she claims to (To give you a better idea, she only took me to get my ears checked because she realized THIS YEAR that something was wrong with me. I got diagnosed with hyperacusis. I was uncomfortable with noise since grade 6, and it became worse, which is how my mother finally noticed. Or, when I was a toddler, my grandmother had to be the one to tell my mother that something was wrong with my breathing. I got diagnosed with Asthma thanks to her, before anything fatal could have happened.) I can't talk to my parents about anything either. They know that something is wrong with me and they are trying to 'heal' me by forcing me into social environments, even risking my academics just to turn me 'normal'. I can't talk to them about this.

I could honestly name so much more, but I don't want to make this post any longer than it already is. What do people with unreliable parents do when they're trying for a diagnosis? Should I wait until adulthood? Should I just not get a diagnosis at all? ";;;;
2025-09-08 22:19:39;Was my diagnosis rushed?;"Hi! I (20M) recently got diagnosed with level 1 autism and ADHD, but the process felt pretty rushed.

It started with an online call that was expected to be an hour long but it only took around 30 minutes. The professional asked me about my development, how i did in school, how i felt/acted in social situations etc. Stuff that seemed pretty standard from what i've gathered online. But what worries me is that it was the only interview i had during the assessment.

After it was done, i got sent a bunch of scale in questionaries covering ASD, ADHD and Anxiety/Depression.

Responded all of those, about 3 days go by and i already have the report? I don't know man... i also feel like i should've researched more about the assessment before doing it because i've been seeing testimonies of people saying theirs was done by a whole team while mines was done by only one person, also if things like eye contact, gestures and speech/language patterns were taken into account it was only in that one online meeting that i had my webcam on. Although the professional that analysed me has a pretty strong name in that field, i still left the assessment kind of insecure. Based on my description, does it look like it was properly done? Or should i get a second opinion?

PS: Sorry about any grammatical errors as english is not my first language. I tried my best.";;;;
2025-09-08 19:07:57;Please don't hate me for asking this;Did getting a diagnosis make things easier for you and did you start getting more productive, or did getting a diagnosis give you an excuse not to try as hard? 😔🙏;;;;
2025-09-07 08:55:42;Special interest or just interest?;"So, as the title says, I have no clue of what I have.
How do I tell if I have a special interest or not? Like do I have have to be obsessed with it? Or think about only that certain thing? Like is there a way to tell?  
E.g. I watched a movie about bombs and just suddenly really wanted to research a fudge ton of bombs, same with WW2/Hitler Germany shit. Or even like MLP. 
I just wanna know if I just find an interest in it or have a special interest. I have no clue as I got diagnosed recently and have no one to explain anything. I would really appreciate if someone can help. Thank you. ";;;;
2025-09-07 06:05:27;I'm getting diagnosed and i'm scared.;"**TLDR; I don't feel ""autistic enough"" and it's driving me kinda crazy :)**

I (17M) am going to a psychologist this week to get an autism diagnosis/assessment.

I believe i'm high masking due to not so ideal life circumstances namely living in a developing country with a deeply ingrained macho culture.

I researched autism for months now, my first doctor said i can't be autistic because ""an autistic person can't talk or hold eye contact."" while i know that's a big false generalization it still instills doubts in me.

Here is a list of tests i've done that i plan on showing the psychologist:

TESTS: source (embrace-autism.com)  
  
**• Autism spectrum quotient:**  
  
   My score: **33**   
  
\- A **28**\+ score indicates autism traits.  
  
**• RAADS-R:**  
    
  My score: **145**  
  
\- A **130**\+ score indicates ""strong evidence for autism"".  
  
**• RBQ-2A:**  
  
   My score: **33**  
  
\- Threshold score: **26**\+  
  
**• The Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire:**  
  
   My score: **157**  
  
\- Average score for autistic MALES are: **109.64**  
  
\- Average score for autistic FEMALES are: **124.35**

  
The thing is, i don't know if i'm a lying attention-seeking smartass teenager or  **""i'm genuinely autistic and my masking is too good for people to notice""** and my mind keeps telling me this sentence is false and it feels so fucking bad and isolating, *and that's how it felt my whole life.* 

I learned english when i was 7 and from there on every time i wasn't at school i was in my room searching on the internet for answers:

\- loneliness

\- alienation

\- feeling you ""don't belong anywhere""

\- difficulty maintaining friendships(not that i tried to, i don't feel the need to call or reach out)

\- copying personalities from movies and tv shows and famous people etc. 

\- studying body language and psychology and social skills and ""how to human"" basically

\- questioning religion and authority and a weird fascination with occultism

\- several special interests that last years at a time ranging from basketball and boxing to music to movies to philosophy and mythology

\- ""stims"" like pacing around and listening to the same song over and over

(I don't think i have sensory issues tho, so there is that.)

  
when i say i'm masking i mean that i'm your cool loud funny friend, i'm the quiet guy at your group project, i'm the tough guy that doesn't respect others, i'm the caring wise person,i'm your grumpy family member.

**I'm all those people and none of them at the same time, it just depends on who i'm dealing with.**

  
I think it's worth mentioning that i was pacing around my room listening to ""11:00PM"" by Moisés Nieto when i was contemplating how and/or should i write this.

And that i've been listening to ""connection"" by the rolling stones on repeat while making the post.

i don't know why i made this post maybe i just had to get this off my chest.

to anyone struggling like me,

i hope you don't give up on yourself and that you know that you're deserving of love, and that it's going to be okay.

i genuinely hope so.

2025-09-06 16:17:42;How can people assess their internal experiences?;"Tl;dr: Autism assessment seems to often involve judging if aspects of your internal experience of the world are significantly outside average. How is that possible to assess if there aren't clear behavioural differences?

My situation: I am considering somewhat later in life whether I might be autistic, prompted largely by it turning out that my partner very likely is and the things I have been learning from her journey. Until recently I have always assumed that I had a few slightly autistic traits but nowhere near what would qualify for diagnosis. I am trying to decide whether it's worth pursuing formal assessment myself.

The thing I am finding the most confusing is that since learning about the phenomenon of masking, it seems like autism assessment requires a lot of looking at someone's internal experience of the world. Are you ""very"" uncomfortable with certain things or merely ""slightly"" uncomfortable with them? This is a question about whether it feels very different in your brain than other people feel in theirs. Maybe I use the word ""very"" at a level of discomfort that someone else would call ""slightly"", or vice versa.

I can see two hypotheses about myself:

1) I am autistic, at a mild enough level where I have been able to mask a lot without realising I'm doing it. Retreating into my head to avoid sensory or social overload, rehearing conversations and analysing people and social rules etc.

2) I am an introverted neurotypical person with a few subclinical autistic traits. My dislikes/difficulties are not that far outside the average. Although since learning more about autism I have noticed more of these - like (to pick a random example) being very bothered by the sound of something rattling when I open a fridge door and opening it very slowly to avoid that sound - these are maybe somewhat caused by a suggestive effect of learning about autism. Like saying ""don't think about an elephant"" making you think of an elephant.

I don't know how to distinguish these scenarios without the ability to switch brains with other people to see how differently they experience the world. Does anyone have insights on this problem? I know that one response is ""if you suspect you might be autistic then get a professional assessment"", but I'd be curious to know how well even professionals can tackle the problem of each of us ultimately being stuck in our own brain.";;;;
2025-09-06 10:11:19;The Ebs and Flows;"
I (32M) self-diagnosed in April this year. I was raised thinking I was ND (although my mum would say “that’s your autism” to me growing up when I did something unusual).

My sister (30F) had an ADHD diagnosis 2 years ago, with the suggestion she get tested for autism too. Of the two of us, she’s the loud, social outgoing one, so naturally I started joking that if she had ADHD maybe I had autism.

I started pulling up examples from the past - googling “how to have a conversation” or “how to dance”; incessant tapping and rocking on my chair; I’d read every book in my parents house at some point and got started on the encyclopaedias because I just felt compelled to read anything; I use to paint LOTR Warhammer models whilst watching the films, back-to-back with the directors commentary and then the cast commentary and the. The editors commentary and then the crew commentary and then the producers commentary, then I’d move onto the SFX disks, then move onto the next film. I was about 10 years old and I’d do this for a full weekend.

I had other examples. The examples more I remembered, the more it started to not be much of a joke anymore. The more I remembered, the more details I remembered and the more these examples seemed to support my hypothesis.

This year I’ve been using Chat GPT as a journal and had put a lot of text into it written in a prose that had no audience but me. Off the dome. I’d never mentioned autism to it, and one day I asked it to analyse my writing style and guess my neurotype.

Autism and ADHD. 

I asked for some resources from late diagnosed high masking men, so I read everything it gave me and damn. I felt like I’d read a mirror. 

I followed the trail to embrace-autism.com and did all the tests on there.

CAT-Q: 137
RAADS-R: 120
AQ: 32
Aspie Quiz: 125

After seeing this I had a somatic shift. The realisation struck. I was autistic. I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise myself. At the same time I felt… real? Like a fog had been lifted, like I’d solved a puzzle I didn’t know I was solving.  It was a surreal experience.

I did the embrace-autism tests again a few weeks later to check and got higher scores.

I’m interested in hearing other peoples self-diagnosis stories? I keep having days where I question if I am autistic or not, wonder if I’m taking time or space away from people suffering more. 

I’m trying to integrate and improve my life. Ive definitely fallen under the “substance abuse” umbrella before and Im keen to stop. 

Thoughts and suggestions welcomed!

2025-09-06 01:55:46;Autistic without sensory difficulties?!;Basically when I was younger they said I met the criteria for an autism diagnosis because I had two areas of difficulty. One was repetitive restrictive behaviours (obsessions with particular topics and struggling to move on) and the other was inability to pick up on the social cues of the examiner. However I don't have many sensory needs, sometimes I may run my hands across bumpy walls or touch sharp bristles because I like that input but I haven't really got much noise sensitivity or anything else. I think literally but that's internally, I understand idioms because I was taught their meaning but in my head I have a literal interpretation. Can autism present mainly internally? ;;;;
2025-09-05 22:28:09;Because of autism or not?;"Hellooooo 15F here, unofficially diagnosed with high functioning autism here.

Im just wondering if those things can be caused by autism or not :)

* I absolutely hate fights : I dont mind fights in movies or shows, but fights In real life, even playfights can make me stressed. A little exemple : back when I was 10, we went to Disneyland Paris and we were watching the fireworks show, and at some point, two adults got into a fight (not a big one, but they were like pushing each other and stuff) and I remember getting extremely stressed, I felt like crying, and even begged my mother if we could go away.
* I dont understand and DESPISE the humor of most teenagers my age. What I mean is like brainrot…. Like whats so funny about it. And also tiktok trendy stuff like now “6 7” (I genuinely dont get it) and well just the humor of most people my age in general.
* I LOVE games based on collecting things. Even games that aren’t specifically based on that, but allow that feature. 

Thats about all";;;;
2025-09-04 22:03:20;Is that because of autism??;"Hello, 15F here unofficially diagnosed with high functioning autism.

So, I am hyper empathetic, like really.

Problem is…. I am unable to show it.

I feel some weird… embarrassment, fear or anxiety at the idea of comforting someone.

The few times I tried to do it, I was just…. Emotionless, I kind of didnt knew how to express what I felt, I was scared that it would be to much, not enough, or weird, I was unable to adapt my facial expression or tone, I just remained…. Neutral, like even going past the fear and anxiety and stuff, I was just unable to.

In general, I am unable to display my real emotions, dont know why.




I was wondering if it is linked to autism or not?";;;;
2025-09-04 19:31:43;Hypersensitivity to responses. Can you relate to this?;"I posted this question yesterday but it disappeared, so I must not have worded it correctly.  I was diagnosed ASD (Asperger's) 8 years ago when I was 46.  All of my life, I have had a horrible rejection problem when someone gave a dissenting answer to something I said, like I am certain I said something offensive and that I need to change how I think so I never offend anyone ever again.  The reality is that offenses are just part of life and no two people are ever going to see things exactly the same way.  Like here on Reddit, I can post a response to a question and then another person responds to my answer I get a bit embarrassed that I didn't see it their way and kind of feel like I have just been scolded.  They could be really nice about it but for whatever reason my head has always taken a differing opinion as ""that person thinks you're an idiot"" and this just makes me work harder to be less offensive, which in turn increases my anxiety, which in turn probably makes me pretty unpleasant to be around.  

Is anyone else as sensitive as this? Because I have always felt absolutely alone in this area.";;;;
2025-09-04 02:25:55;How can I ask my friend if he’s autistic?;"I’m a ND (ADHD) woman. I went out with a guy I met and REALLY liked him. He has chronic illness that he’s trying to get under control, and so he had to end the dating relationship. He and I are “friends” now in that I really care about him, we talk and catch up occasionally, and stay in touch. I still like him and want to be more than friends. He doesn’t think we can date until he’s “cured.”

I highly suspect that he is autistic (I can share why if curious — this all-or-nothing thinking about dating is part of it) and I highly suspect that autistic burnout and lack of self-understanding is contributing to his chronic fatigue and burnout. I just want to help him. I’m not sure if he has ever been diagnosed, which is why I want to ask him and/or gently suggest.

How can I do that in a way that is okay? Or should I just not because it’s not my place? I am really afraid of overstepping his boundaries. I want to build his trust and I don’t want to push him away. Would really appreciate advice!";;;;
2025-09-03 21:45:12;Diagnosis constantly being questioned (by doctors and psychologists);"(sorry I don't know if this is the right flair to use)

I have recently run into a very frustrating problem after finally deciding to reach out for help regarding my mental health (public health system). Despite living in a first world country everyone seems wildly uneducated about autism here. I was diagnosed at 17 (adult now), my official diagnosis says ""Aspergers level 2"" (but I think they might have changed the definition to being under the ASD spectrum now, not separate). I have a concrete diagnosis by a psychologist, yet every mental health and medical professional I have seen this year has been questioning my diagnosis, saying there is ""no evidence"" of aspergers after meeting with me ONE TIME and we didn't even discuss my ASD traits. And I honestly think it's just because I am a woman. I was speaking to this one psychologist in an introduction meeting to see what options I have, this was a woman as well. I told her I have Aspergers, she asked what that diagnosis means for me, like how it impacts me. I try to explain to her my social issues, how I don't get social rules, I have genuinely 0 friends, routine is important to me, everything is difficult etc... (I was very tired and I even told her I'm not doing my best explaining). She seemed very understanding and agreeing with me, she never said anything against what I was saying or my diagnosis, I genuinely thought I was finally speaking to someone who understood. Then a week after I read her report on me and she writes that I need to be reassessed for my diagnosis?? 

I brought this up with my GP and she asked me if I am ""maybe getting too attached to my diagnosis"" and  basically if I am making it my personality, as if it's a fleeting diagnosis and not something I have for life? I feel like I am going insane, I am just trying to get help for my severe depression and no one is listening to me. People, doctors, they never have. I feel I could list the entire diagnostic criteria word for word and they still wouldn't believe me. Now I have an appointment for a diagnostic review next week (not just for ASD, it's sort of a standard to get treatment, but I am guessing this is the main thing) and I feel like they are not going to listen to me in the slightest and try to take my diagnosis away from me. I am autistic, it's the only thing I've ever been sure about, my whole family agrees, my sibling is also diagnosed. There is no reason for them to question this, I am barely a functioning as a person, I can't work, I dropped out of school, I do the same things every day and it's not even much. 

I can't cancel my appointment with them because I can't afford private care and I desperately need help, but if they say I don't have ASD then that means I won't get the right treatment. I thought about bringing a copy of my diagnosis report to my meeting, since they even said they couldn't find it (? it's literally in my medical journal) but I don't know if that's too much. They obviously seem to have a very stereotypical view on ASD and I don't know how they can make these decisions when they clearly don't know enough about it. 

I do think I have the right to refuse an asd re-assessment, and honestly it's just a waste of time, It could take months that could be used for treatment or assessing me for other problems. And that is if they even hear what I am saying. I don't know if anyone else here has experienced this, I really need advice and I feel so helpless. ";;;;
2025-09-03 10:21:20;Can you be diagnosed by 1 thing only?;"hi people, i wanted to know if you can get diagnosed or have autism based on 1 criteria only, what i meant is this, i've heard of rigid routines, sensory issues and stimming, but i don't have any of them at all, but the thing i relate to is the social side of things, once i read about literal thinking and missing social cues, i was like ""wait, is this me?"", now i'm not fully sure because i really wasn't aware of it, but i do relate to autistic people on tiktok who share their social interactions, i initially thought i only had social anxiety. the thing is, the tiktoks i watch always mention stimming or some other things after being overwhelmed by things which i didn't relate to at all, so i'm in this limbo right now that is PISSING me off";;;;
2025-09-03 10:09:27;No matter what I do I don't feel completely valid in my neurodivergence;"It's been 10 months. I've now been formally diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I've been doing research on both for 10 months straight and I STILL can't fully process or understand who I am. I have learned a LOT, but it still doesn't feel enough or concrete enough for me to fully accept. It's like I've garnered all of this information and now I need to take action to improve my life, but I still feel like I need more information, and the more information I get the more I need. It's never ending. I hate that there is nothing completely certain about autism diagnosis or identification. In short, I'm struggling to synthesize the information I have and form a new cohesive identity. The thought spirals are uncontrollable.

Can anyone relate? Any advice? I'm thinking of getting a new (neurodivergent) therapist because while I love my current (neurotypical) therapist, and she was super helpful with the initial processing, I feel like I've gotten to a place where my goals and needs outweigh her expertise.";;;;
2025-09-03 04:54:03;Just learned listening to the same song on repeat for three hours straight can be a form of stimming;"That’s the latest entry in my “not diagnosed but pretty sure” list, which has been expanding for months. Certain days a tune just really clicks and I don’t get tired of it. Other days I might not be able to stand the same song. Interesting how that works.

2025-09-02 13:50:09;I finally accepted that I need a care team, and it’s really great;"I’m a single person who lives alone and doesn’t have family support at the moment. My therapist referred me to a program that provides PAs to support me as I heal from burnout. So, I started having a PA come once a week to clean like a year into intense burnout, when I was still processing my new diagnosis, adjusting to my drastically increased support needs, and the idea of being “officially” disabled. I figured I just needed a cleaner to come once a week and I could handle the rest. 

A year later I’ve realized I need more support than I’ve been getting, and I’m starting to acknowledge and accept my “level 2” support needs. I have a small care team who come multiple times a week, who I know I can call on whenever I need them, and who understand my meltdown and shutdown protocol (because I listed it in bullet points for them in an instructional document I made) Having people who are here just to care for me has helped me unmask consistently and get more comfortable asking for my needs directly without being worried about coming across as rude. 

Edit: I don’t have the ability to reply to many comments rn, but for those who asked, I get assistance through a state-funded behavioral health service in the Pacific Northwest US. So it’s not a program specifically for autistic adults, but for those with severe mental health conditions. (I have a co-occurring condition) Supports exist for autistic adults through Developmental Disability Services in my state as well… I’ve been waiting for approval for that. I wouldn’t have been able to find this support without the help of a therapist who referred me, and a social worker who continues to research and pursue additional supports for me. Finding a therapist or social worker who will listen to what your needs are and advocate for you is a good place to start. ";;;;
2025-09-02 07:43:43;Discovering my own autism late in life, and only realizing now that my adult son possesses many autistic traits as well. I regret a lot of my parenting because now I see that I was forcing him to mask to fit into a neurotypical world. I am consumed with grief that I failed him.;"I’m in my late 50s, my son is in his late 20s. We live in different states and only see each other a few times a year. Our relationship is often pleasant yet compartmentalized and a little stilted. I know that he cares deeply about me as his mom, but also never reaches out to me and is somewhat guarded when we are together.

Just recently I discovered my own autism and am overwhelmed with various feelings of relief, regrets, anger, sadness, etc. and that includes so much about my relationship with my son. It’s very clear to me that he shares many of the same traits now that I can see us through the lens of autism. 

I am wracked with grief, regret, and sadness that I couldn’t understand why he was the way he was. During his childhood I often corrected him and tried to teach him how to behave ‘appropriately’ in a neurotypical world. 

Ijust can’t get past my regret and sadness. He’s never been assessed for autism (in those days the only children who got assessed were children who had significant challenges functioning at school, and since he didn’t fit that model, he flew under the radar)

Recently, I have begun to share with him that I recognize in myself a lot of autistic traits and I mentioned some other family members with similar behaviors. I have not said anything to him that I recognize autistic traits in him. I don’t want to him to feel that I am judging him or that I am placing a diagnosis or the label of disability on him in any way. 

He told me once about 10 years ago that a girlfriend had advised him to take an online autism assessment. He said that he had taken it but it didn’t conclude that he had enough traits to be considered autistic. At that point in our lives, I had no understanding of autism so I didn’t recognize all the things that I can now see so clearly.

Without telling him straight up that I’m pretty sure he’s autistic, how can I express my deep sadness and regret for trying to force him to behave like a neurotypical person? It is so clear to me now that through my ignorance and misguided parenting behaviors I forced him into masking, and probably made him feel scrutinized, inadequate and criticized. 

I know parents often have hindsight regrets about the way they’ve raised their children, but this has affected me in a way that I just can’t bear. I want to apologize to him. I want to share some of these examples where I now see how I could’ve done better had I understood his needs. I feel like that would maybe have changed the entire trajectory of our relationship if he had felt that I was an ally rather than an adversary. But he’s an adult —if he doesn’t think he’s ND, then there’s really nothing I can say to him. 

My heart is broken for that lost opportunity to love and support him him in the ways that he needed during his formative years.  I understand that many of my parenting behaviors must have been quite damaging and I hate that I’m just understanding this now. 

I know nobody can give me any answers. I just needed to get this off my chest. 

Edited to add: thank you all for your thoughtful comments. I can’t reply individually right now, but you’ve all given me a lot to think about. I do agree that I should talk to him about my observations about myself through the lens of autism, and how this has me thinking I could’ve done better as a parent had I had a broader understanding of his needs. 

I know I’m having a very intense emotional response right now because this is all very fresh for me. It’s a bit overwhelming.

2025-09-01 03:18:22;I think I might be autistic;"I am about to Yap about symptoms so if your not ready for me to become a professional yapper, dont read this. 

Okay so I have a bit of sensory issues, I hate loud noises, specifics fabrics make me feel super uncomfortable, different smells eg hair shampoo make me very uncomfortable. Chewing sounds also make me uncomfortable can't make eye contact, only with my friends, or I'm just looking around at what evers behind the person I'm talking to instead of directly into their eyes. I get anxious easily, and over think so I don't really know if I'm autistic or just self diagnosing and being hateful for thinking that I'm autistic. 

My entire dads side of the family pretty much has ADHD or Autism so it might be genetic. Also I just realized that I used to do ""Dino hands"" when I was younger. I hyperfixate on things frequently, they change every month or so. I think I'm pretty much a maladaptive daydreamer bc I daydream it all the time ever since I was six. 

I can't go to a phycologidt to get diagnosed because everyone thinks I'm seeking for attention when I say I think I might be autistic. I am a child, so I can't exactly go to a phycologist myself without a parental guardian. 

Am I autistic? ";;;;
2025-09-01 00:59:00;Why go for a diagnosis? /sarcasm;"So, this week I went to my third psychiatrist in the spam of one year and a half. 

Since the beginning of my journey with these type of professionals I've been searching for someone who will refer me to get an autism diagnosis (because I suspect that I'm autistic since 2022). 

The first one was unprepared and, listening to my complaint, asked me some questions of a short assessment questionnaire, said that I scored inside de spectrum but said I don't have deficits. 

The second psychiatrist barely heard what I said and jumped into conclusion that ""because I had good grades in a difficult school, and because I tried to initiate friendships as a kid, I couldn't be autistic"".

And the third one listened me for something like 40 minutes. I said a lot of things about why I think I'm neurodivergent, said a lot of traits. And he agreed that I am. But he said I shouldn't get a diagnosis, that I shouldn't attach myself to labels and that I should just keep my medication for depression/anxiety plus my antipsychotic that the first doctor prescribed me and I've been using since then. 

I don't have much of a life outside the schoolar/academic environment. When I was on High School, I only left my house to go to school. Now that I'm at University, I do the same. I don't hang out with friends, don't go to parties. All my friends are from uni or high school. And, because of that, my routine isn't disrupted. 

So I think I don't face many deficits because my life is under my control most of the times. I'm always doing the things under what's expected for me to do, there's nothing challenging the order of how I do things. 

And as for social interaction problems: I'm lucky that the biggest part of persons that I interact are comprehensive. They don't treat me bad, even if I'm ""weird"", so life is more easy this way. Differently from all my childhood where I was bullied by existing. 

To be honest, I don't know if I should keep trying to get a diagnosis. All my neurodivergent friends agree that I'm not neurotypical, and all my NT friends agree that there's something going on with me. I'll probably stick with the self diagnosis until I have money to pay for the process... Or I'll never go for it and live knowing that I could get help in some areas but wont. 

But why a diagnosis should be helpful, right? How having a paper that explains why you're the way you are can help people understand you?";;;;

I expect to have the final results next month. Many people consider me ""mildly autistic,"" but I don't have the classic sensory, eating, or cognitive impairment symptoms.

 but I’ve always wondered what it meant, and why I didn’t get diagnosed with Asperger’s? (I know it’s all merged now anyways, but I can’t help ruminating) I’ve read several places that “atypical autism arises most often in individuals with severe intellectual impairment or lack of receptive language” And I have none of those things? I scored an even profile and above average on the iq test, and I had no language delays as a kid, and have always been considered “high functioning/low support needs” (until I hit burnout) So I’m just a little confused I guess.";;;;
2025-08-31 15:59:27;I feel so bad, suspicion and 'self diagnosis';"Hi, quick post because I feel pure chaos mentally. I'm someone who doesn't have a formal diagnosis and someone who unfortunately can't get an assessment either given my environment. And so I've been merely suspecting autism and I am personally pretty sure that I have it. I've been looking for validation from other people before and I have come to realize that there's no point in doing it anyway, and I also kind of feel bad because of it. I never literally claimed to be autistic, but around friends I'd always just hint at it when telling them about my issues and myself generally. I feel like those attempts are a product of desperation because I need people to tell me that I'm not just imagining my symptoms and basically my whole life. I have imposter syndrome that tells me that I'm not autistic once someone else talks about their experience and it doesn't feel relatable. And I keep telling myself that I'm only lying about my symptoms. To put it simply, there are days where I literally tell myself mentally 'I'm not autistic, I'm fine.' , then other days where I'm like 'I'm genuinely having a hard time existing around other people, it makes sense for me'.

I used to suspect ADHD two years ago because my friends told me that I probably have it. I had a rough time at school at the time and I couldn't focus at all. And I was pretty convinced myself, I thought that I had it. Looking back I realize that, even though some things do sound relatable to me, I don't have the aspects that would be life altering for ADHD. I know that autism makes way more sense now that I'm suspecting that, but sometimes I feel bad about even being convinced to myself that I am autistic when I hear how diagnosed people on the internet talk about self-diagnosis and when I see people that have it worse than me. And I gaslight myself into agreeing with them and I basically shame myself in the process. And it's honestly messing with my mental health that is already at a low point since I'm going through genuinely bad times right now. Idk";;;;
2025-08-31 05:49:37;Actually learning to relax;"I am not formally diagnosed, and am new to considering that I might actually be autistic. I have kind of suspected for a while now, but felt like I was just being dramatic or my struggles weren't enough to warrant a diagnosis. I am just starting to realize how much I have been masking/compensating, and the idea that I am autistic feels more accurate now. 

One thing that I struggle with is actually getting my system to down-regulate. I just spent a lovely morning doing things that I love and am now at home ""relaxing,"" but I can't actually rest. It's like I try so hard to enjoy something that it becomes stressful, and then I come home and try to hard to relax, and it doesn't work. Sometimes I try too hard at trying not to try hard. 

Additionally, most of my hobbies involve physical activity and it is common for me to get done with work and want to do something physical (my idea of fun), but be too overstimulated and I can tell that doing something physical would make everything worse. The only thing that helps me down-regulate is getting stoned and scrolling, but I don't want to spend my life doing that. I used to just push through and exercise anyway, but that resulted in two previous episodes of severe burnout (bedridden for \~6mo the first time, 1yr the second time). 

I've tried more discipline, and that only resulted in burnout. Less discipline feels like I'm just wasting my life away. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my system to actually rest and recover, so I can feel better and do more of my favorite activities?";;;;
2025-08-31 00:18:17;Psychiatrist implied I do not actually have autism;"Howdy. I’m (F 24) trying to find a new psychiatrist for meds reasons and I had an appointment with someone the other day that left me quite upset.

She asked my diagnoses and I told her OCD and autism (which I was diagnosed with in 2021 at 20 years old). She asked me why they “thought” I had autism and every symptom I told her I experienced she said “well that could also be OCD.”

Examples I told her:
 -I struggle in social situations because it feels like people have unspoken rules that I don’t know about -I get overstimulated and have sensory issues, which when bad enough, cause me to have a verbal shutdown or need to lock myself in a dark quiet room to calm down 
-I have repetitive motions to comfort me, when I am anxious, and when I am excited.

For each of these, and more, she said it could just be OCD and HEAVILY implied that I don’t have it. I think one problem is that I don’t remember my childhood and I have a complicated family dynamic, so I can’t really speak on any childhood symptoms.

Anyway, this is half rant and half asking if anyone has similar experiences. Now the OCD is kicking in and telling me I’ve been faking it all along.";;;;

             Barrier

I (36m) was diagnosed a year ago with Autism, GAD, Depression, and Unspecified Trauma.

Yesterday, when working on a puzzle with my partner, I finally was able to figure out how to put this into words that I think explain my experience.

For others, it seems like there is typically little to no cost when switching from ""processing"" to ""communication"". In my case there seems to be a toll bridge. 

Toll: 
- memory retention 
- confidence 
- traumatic trigger

Often, while trying to interpret and process something I have been told, I tend to go quiet [1]. When asked ""why I am just staring into space?"", I now have to pay at least one of these tolls so that I can communicate what is happening for me. In this particular instance, I felt as though someone had slapped me in the back of the head and screamed at me [2], so naturally I also paid the confidence toll, and still lost my train of thought.

This also seems to occur when I'm interrupted while speaking, or when people talk over one another and I don't feel like I can engage. I did not believe this to be unusual, but if that were the case it seems like more people would be sympathetic to it.

Questions:
- Do others experience similar?
- Is this a named phenomenon?
- Is this attributable to autism, other, or is it just a normal human experience that no one acknowledges?

-----

[1] Especially when the thing I've been told is that I have to take a different approach to something than I usually do.

[2] My partner did not do this, but it felt a bit like it happened. I had the urge to cover myself, plead for forgiveness, and let them know I was trying. Unsure if tension in neck was there before, but noticed it afterwards.

2025-08-30 18:46:54;Late DXed, not sure it gets better;"About 5 years in since diagnosis, middle aged and finding myself just about ready to give up. I have to be careful what I say anymore to any one, feel like I am expected to put on some sort of mas, don't know which one, and then people have this tendency to disappear. Yeah, its common, we get busy, life takes us different paths...

But I'm starting to think that there just isn't a place for me. There never was and there never will be. The current situation feels inescapable, the person I live with just makes me feel more alone...

I really don't want to get into details, but it's getting to the point I don't even know why I'm still here. I've done the grippy socks vacation, and it was more trauma dressed up as a solution

I also see where we are headed in this country and I just... Don't believe we are a good country anymore... We really never were, but that is also compounding my suffering - not only do I find people incredibly frustrating/confusing, I don't feel like I belong here or the people very good. Don't tell you know who, either, as he'd find some real life hell scape to catapult me to... And take pleasure in it. 

Anyways, I know it's a conglomerate of hormones and medication titration but suicidal ideation has hit me so fucking hard. I talk to my therapist on Tuesday, but once again I could use someone to talk to right now. I've told them that when I need someone, it's after office hours. It's the weekend, or even worse it's the holiday... The one where in my head everyone else is having the time of their lives, while I spend another year of it by myself. 

And before people say hey come join me, that's part of the problem. I can put the general customer service face on, get along... Even converse... But as far as any longstanding relationships, it's felt like either it came with dick OR I do ALL the chasing, when I do find someone I would actually like to see more of. People don't reach out to me, to check on my well-being. Ok... My aunt will likely call me in a month or two, probably relay to my parents whom I am estranged from. I mean shit why would I want to talk to my mother when my closest friend knows how incredibly depressed I am, tried to reach out to her - knowing my brother commited suicide and ""she would do anything for him"" (it was obviously just for him)... She didn't even try to contact my exhusband (who I live with), nor did she even try to reach out to me - she called the cops, during fucking COVID, for a wellness check... Then blew up my phone when I told the people the fucking truth, saying I'm just crying wolf - no mother, you had absolutey no business procreating, couldn't emotionally support yourself let alone someone else... Why are you my fucking mother again?

Anyways, yeah I'm AuDHD and there's zero plans but I fucking hate it here.";;;;
2025-08-30 06:17:14;AITA for letting my gf use my account? Why did my friends stop talking to me?;"Hey, so i (15 F) got a gf recently, we liked eachother beforehand and we were friends before we got together, and my friends never really liked her even before any of us showed any signs of liking eachother (i was getting over a situationship and she was ""staright"" until recently. We were talking and ended up logging on eachothers accounts on Instagram. Btw I completely trust her and i wouldnt have given her access to something so private if i didn't. The moment she texted in the gc they all told her to get out of the account (by what right????) and when she said no (cuz its my account duh) they removed my account from all the gcs.

I kinda understood since yk privacy and stuff but my friends aren't talking to me at all now?

I told the admin friend that my gf is outta my account now and stuff and she said something along the lines of ""shut up (my name), what kind of thing is this?"" (This is my best try at translating this to English so its not exactly what she said) And she isnt replying to anything im texting her, and no one else from the 'friend' group is texting me.

I genuinely cant tell if i did smth wrong or not, and not to play victim but i highly suspect having autism and in the process of being diagnosed and stuff, and I fully understand that that's not an excuse to be a jerk but I'm saying it to clarify that I have occasional issues with understanding stuff that are obvious for neurotypical people.

Im kinda new to everything since im young, and really nervous about hurting people i care about, whether its my friends or my gf.

Thanks if you read this all the way through, and I'd really appreciate any help and advice";;;;
2025-08-28 16:16:32;Late (possible) diagnosis;"Hi,

Recently my psychiatrist told me he sees autistic traits in me, and it actually makes some sense. He isn’t 100% sure yet, and we’ll talk again in November, but I’m still pretty shaken. I’m 42, and until now I’ve only ever been diagnosed with general anxiety. I’ve been in therapy for years on and off, and I’m on antidepressants.

Honestly, I was half-expecting ADHD, because I’ve always felt like there was “something more” going on. But autism feels different, and a bit strange to take in.

My first question is: how can I be sure? I keep hearing things like “everyone seems to have it these days,” and people around me have said that too, which leaves me confused.

Second: what do I actually *do* with this information now? Part of me feels like it’s too late. Maybe if I had known earlier, I could have had an easier childhood (I was a very sad child), maybe more friends as a teenager, maybe more ambition and direction as an adult instead of being stuck in a job I hated for years.

But now… I more or less like my life. So what’s the point of knowing?

";;;;
2025-08-27 19:19:40;4 years waiting for autism assessment, dismissed as anxiety, feeling hurt & misunderstood;"Hi, this is my first time making a Reddit post, I’ll do my best to be clear.
I’m F20, afab, UK. I just got back from my autism assessment, which I’d been waiting 4 years for, only to be told I’m “just an introvert with social anxiety.”
Their reasons were:
* I have maintained long friendships (one with a childhood friend and one, now ex, bf who was diagnosed autistic).
* I’m close with my two sisters and show understanding for them.
* My interests have changed over time, and my intense interest in them was explained away as me being “smart and intellectual.”
* My rigid routines and difficulties with change were explained as anxiety.

No comment was made on my sensory issues, repetitive behaviours, or non-verbal communication differences, except noting that I’m “well spoken.” I was also told all of this is “fixable and treatable,” which felt particularly hurtful because to me this feels like who I am - not something broken to fix.
I’m writing this because I feel really hurt. I unloaded myself onto people who were meant to understand me, only to leave feeling even more misunderstood. After four years of waiting, it feels like I’ve just been destroyed at the assessment.
I was wondering: has anyone else been through something similar? How did you pick yourself up afterwards?
I can’t help but feel like if I presented more like the stereotypical male autism profile, I might have walked out with a diagnosis.";;;;
2025-08-27 02:31:37;making ASD friends 🥲;"Hi all,
My therapist is encouraging me (25f) to connect with other high-functioning autistic women/people, and I have no idea where to begin. I feel like I’m too autistic for neurotypicals, but also haven’t met many neurodivergent folks who seem to be on the same operating system as I am. I’m extremely emotional and sensitive, but also incredibly blunt and direct… trauma has made me very hesitant to speak about/engage with my special interests. (Video games, performance arts, song writing, etc.) I realize this is an uncommon trauma response for an aspergirl, but I do have a formal diagnosis that I am confident in. I’m very spooked by the idea of trying, but also in desperate need of community! All advice welcome! ";;;;
2025-08-26 23:49:40;ADOS-2 Module 4 not fully administered?;"\*\*ADOS-2 spoilers\*\*

I just finished my testing and I’m really confused and upset. I’m a 24yo female and did my testing through Bend Health since it’s the only place I could find covered by insurance. I made it very clear that I was there for autism (ASD) testing and that I am specifically looking for someone familiar with the female autism phenotype theory.

At my intake they asked me things like “what are your symptoms,” which already was off to a bad start for me because… I’m 24. Nothing feels like a “symptom” it’s just my life and how I am. On top of that, my sister is diagnosed autistic and my mom was just diagnosed last month, so it’s also the environment I grew up in.

I then had 2 testing sessions over Zoom. The first session included some kind of online test with the evaluator, and then she administered part of the ADOS-2 Module 4. But she definitely didn’t do the full thing. She asked me about:

* My emotions (do I feel happy/sad, what those feel like)  
* If I have friendships / what a friend is  
* My relationships, if I feel lonely

That’s it. She didn’t include anything related to the creativity, imagination, description, or ""unusual questions"" side of Module 4. The whole thing took maybe 20 minutes. My second testing session was entirely ADHD-focused, even though I’m already diagnosed and didn’t come for that.

I’m not sure what to do now. Is there a reason she wouldn’t administer the entire ADOS-2 Module 4? On one hand, I’m kind of relieved because it sounds like a horrible experience lol but on the other hand, I feel like my results won’t be accurate, and this was probably my only shot at getting testing covered by insurance. Is it appropriate to email them now to ask why the full module wasn’t given, or just wait 3-6 weeks for results (which I’m worried will just say “you have ADHD again”)? I am scared if emailing them asking can somehow also affect results.

I also asked her at the end of my second day of testing if she did the ADOS-2 and I fear maybe I messed up with that, was I not supposed to know what was being done?

**TL;DR:** Did an autism evaluation (ADOS-2 Module 4) but the clinician only did \~20 minutes of questions (emotions, friends, loneliness) and skipped creativity/imagination parts. The rest of the testing focused on ADHD (which I already have diagnosed). Not sure why the entire ADOS-2 Module 4 was not given.";;;;

2025-08-26 20:49:09;hard day =can’t stand touch;"i wanna start by saying i’m not diagnosed, im in the process of getting a second opinion on ADHD and getting an autism assessment. 

the main problem my boyfriend and i run into is me being dismissive of touch, squirming/pulling away and not communicating why. the past two days have been really stressful for me. two days ago i worked (i work as a dog groomer so im overstimulated all day long) then we went to a dinner with his family, afterwards i felt so empty and numb. yesterday work got cancelled bc the hot water heater broke, i had plans to go home and have a self care day since i was supposed to be working 6 days in a row, but i came home to my dog being sick. i was cleaning up the mess for at least an hour and had to take her to the vet. i didn’t stop running around until he got home from work at 7 and by then i was just dead. so the past two nights i have not been a fan of touch. but i really want to enjoy it because i love him and i love being intimate with him i just can’t relax. 

so i am wondering is there anything i can do on these days to reset to be able to enjoy his touch? i suggested on days where i am feeling like that i am more touchy on him than he is me but i would still love any tips anyone has on resetting after a long and stressful day? ways to help him not take it personally? anything is appreciated thank you so much for your time!!

2025-08-26 08:00:13;Processing my diagnosis;"Hi! This is my first time ever using Reddit lol. I’m a 23 year old bi-racial female! Today, I had my assessment for autism and let’s just say I passed with flying colors! My psychologist told me that I was “high functioning and high masking”. I had a feeling I was autistic but now that I know I am, I’m not sure what to do? It’s a lot and it feels overwhelming but comforting? Like to know that there is an explanation behind who I am and how my mind works is nice but terrifying. 

How do you cope with finding out something so big in your early 20s?

There’s a lack of understanding in my cultural community surrounding autism and the spectrum, anyone have any advice/similar experiences?";;;;
2025-08-26 05:12:09;I don’t feel “ready” to work;"Hello all. I hope you are having a good day. I am posting here today because I am an adult living with multiple disabilities including autism and adhd and type 1 diabetes. I have been working with vocational rehab in my state for about 7+ years now. The goal of vocational rehab (for those that don’t know) is to help someone with disabilities find employment. I started with them around the time I finished high school. I went to college for several years but ended up dropping out due to my disability (besides autism, which I was only diagnosed with about two years ago). They helped me pay for books and materials etc. Anyhow, over the years,  they have helped me find a few internships (and I also found a few internships on my own). Unfortunately this has not led to any long lasting jobs. Most recently, I have been looking for part time remote work. This is because this is what I feel comfortable with at this moment. It is also because I live in a rural area and don’t drive. Anyhow, vocational rehab just told me recently that they don’t think me looking for a remote job is working out. They think I should try and find an “in person” Part Time job (or even in person volunteering - which I don’t want to do because I won’t get paid). The problem with that is that I would rely on my parents for transportation. (There is no Uber/Lyft where l live). And the other problem is that I DO NOT feel comfortable with the idea of an in person job. I’m honestly beginning to wonder if I feel ready to work or not. Some part of me thinks no. But at the same time, I don’t want to spend my whole life getting SSI/SSDI. (Which so far I’ve been denied for). I guess I am posting here to vent, but also posting for advice. What would you do if you were me? I suppose I want a job, but only if it’s on
My terms (remote, part time etc) and not until I feel ready. Vocational rehab says that if I don’t start to make progress soon, they can just close my case (which again I don’t want them to do!) I personally don’t see how that is fair! It’s not my fault that I have an anxiety disorder and don’t feel “ready” to be employed. I have tried to tell them This before too, but they just keep pushing me it seems. 

I honestly just don’t know what to do! Does anyone either feel the same way or have any advice for me? I would greatly appreciate it! ";;;;
2025-08-26 03:17:26;Was anyone here diagnosed at a young age?;I was diagnosed at a much earlier age like around 2-4 years old. I know that the vast majority of autistic women mainly high functioning are often diagnosed when they’re adults. Despite being diagnosed I didn’t really receive much help outside of school and all the school offered me was just an iep. My parents despite knowing I’m autistic they practically know nothing about it. All they do is browse Facebook. I was mainly left unmonitored. I also went to a crappy school district and lived in a bad neighborhood. I actually didn’t realize I was autistic until my early teens because they never brought it up around me. I wish I had much better support when I was younger.  I was always the outcast and was either sad angry or mean for no reason. I often got my self in a lot of dumb situations which I regret. ;;;;
2025-08-25 20:21:33;Level 2 autistic adults and others—how do you experience daily life?;"Hi everyone,

I’d like to ask: if you’re Level 2 autistic, what are your life experiences like? In my country there is no “level system,” and there’s a big misconception that you can’t be Level 2 if you’re studying, working, or in a relationship. So I’d really love to hear from you. (And of course, Level 1 or 3 people are welcome to share too!)

⸻

My own experience
	•	I graduated from a boarding private high school and went to the best university in my country.
	•	My IQ is 116, which is probably why my diagnosis came late.

But… things were never smooth:
	•	In high school, I had severe depression, CPTSD, and anxiety. I dreamed of dropping out, but couldn’t, because of my parents and the educational pressure in my Asian country.
	•	After starting college, I fell into autistic burnout. I’ve been in that state for six years now.

⸻

Education and work
	•	In college, I only studied subjects that interested me.
	•	My grades were very uneven, and I barely managed to graduate.
	•	I can’t hold a job. I tried internships, but a fixed schedule and the social demands were overwhelming. (mandatory need to work in fixed schedule and place is too overwhelming and the burnout from social interaction is too big.)
	•	I’ve been unemployed for years despite my academic background.

⸻

Daily life struggles
	•	Executive functioning is a huge barrier.
	•	As a teenager, I didn’t notice because my parents did everything for me. But after college, I realized:
	•	Simple house chores take enormous effort.
	•	Hygiene is possible but very exhausting.
	•	I can stay home for 5 days without showering, and only shower if I have to go outside.
	•	I need to remind myself to brush my teeth and wash my face.
	•	Grooming/clothing is very difficult for me—I don’t know how to style myself.
	•	I can’t cook, drive, or clean properly.
	•	Exercising feels almost impossible.

⸻

Social life
	•	I’m socially isolated.
	•	I see friends maybe once every 3 months.
	•	Most of my time is at home, watching movies/TV/novels that are my special interests.
	•	Recently I’ve become very focused on neurodiversity and explore that every day.

⸻

Masking & functioning
	•	I have no speech or developmental delays.
	•	My verbal IQ is high.
	•	On the surface, I look fine, because I can mask.
	•	But masking is breaking down, and I feel like I’m not high-functioning at all when I look at my actual life.

I didn’t realize this in high school, but now I think I might be Level 2.

⸻

Personal
	•	I’m in my mid-twenties.
	•	I’ve never been in a relationship.
	•	I also struggle with severe depression, anxiety, and RSD (rejection sensitivity dysphoria).

⸻

My question to you
	•	Are there others like me—who studied or worked or had relationships, but still identify as Level 2 or above?
	•	Do you think I could be considered Level 2 too?
	•	Or please just share your experiences. I’d love to hear them.

⸻

Thank you for reading. Please be kind—I’m struggling a lot, and I’d really appreciate gentle responses. Wishing you all the best.";;;;
2025-08-25 16:34:21;DS Cross novels?;"Tim Sullivan wrote a series of detective/thrillers in which the main protagonist, DS Cross, is autistic.  I'm curious as to whether people in the the autism community are familiar with them, and what they think of them.

P.s. I have mental oddities, but am probably not autistic.  (At 76, it doesn't seem worth trying for a diagnosis).  The books make me uncomfortable because they seem steriotyped, but for all I know they may be right on for some people.";;;;
2025-08-25 14:39:30;How do I help my autistic girlfriend deal with a big emotional issue that is happening?;"So my partner (f34) was diagnosed a couple of years ago with level 2 autism. She has really struggled to adjust to life post-diagnosis but I'm proud of the progress she's made. 

This weekend, we have looked after her mum's dog, who we used to have for sleepovers regularly, but now we have our own dog and her mum's dog (Alfie) isn't very good with other dogs so we've had not have him stay with us until now. As her mum went to a festival this weekend, we've taken Alf in and just had to keep the two dogs separated. 

So Alf spent a lot of his younger years living with Zöe, so she feels like he is both her and her mum's dog, understandably. He is now 12 years old though, and in the 2-3 months that we haven't had him stay over, he looks like he's aged about 8 years. This means that my gf is having to come to terms with his mortality and she isn't handling it well. She knows she isn't but I don't know how to support her through this so I'm just giving her cuddles and listening to her tell me how much she is struggling, but I feel like I should be doing more. She hasn't dealt with a lot of death in her life, but the one time she did made her battle with self harm for years and I don't want her to go back to that place.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can help her please?";;;;
2025-08-25 14:29:26;Motor tics?;"Quick rundown- early 30's, formally diagnosed in the last 6 months, suspected for quite a few years. 
When I'm highly emotional, I have involuntary motor tics. There's no vocal element and they came on gradually a little over 7 years ago. Most of the time it's basic head twitches and squeezing my eyes. If I'm under a lot of stress (sensory overload, overstimulated, etc.), my hands, arms and shoulders start as well. I can feel some coming on a few seconds before they happen if the situation isn't too overwhelming, but past a certain point I have zero awareness of which ones are going to happen. What slows and/or stops them is getting into a calm, safe space to decompress, or at the least being with a person I feel safe with. 
I'm aware of the concept that autism and motor tics are not mutually exclusive; is the way they present a me thing or do others experience it as well? I appreciate feedback!";;;;
2025-08-25 04:41:36;psychiatrist doesn't think I'm autistic;"I'm seeing this psychiatrist at uni, after explaining my social struggles, and childhood patterns like obsession with specific subjects, or explaining to her my difficulty understanding between the lines and how I'm always trying to guess what's the socially appropriate thing because I have no idea what it is. also that my twin brother is autistic. she just doesn't think I'm autistic.

I honestly think she probably has an outdated and narrow view of what autism is or what it looks like but I'm almost convinced I'm a high masking autistic and I think if she watched the youtube videos of other diagnosed autistics I relate to like Mom On The Spectrum or I'm Autistic Now What?, she probably would say that they aren't autistic either if she didn't know they're diagnosed because they don't look like the what someone might think of when they hear autism. It infuriates me to be dismissed like this. it's like she made her decision from the start that I'm not autistic because I can converse and force eye contact. I did most of the tests on Embrace Autism multiple times at different times and I got almost the same results each time indicating very high likelihood of autism. I honestly don't care about her opinion. I'll find some autism specialist, not some random psychiatrist, what does she know?

she just thinks its trauma or attachment related which I don't deny, but I think those are highly affected and caused by having undiagnosed autism. it's like she doesn't believe me when I tell her I struggle with eye contact or the other social struggles and thinks me thinking I have autism is just a defense mechanism and I'm tired of people telling me I'm avoidant or analyzing me and thinking there's some hidden trauma or whatever. I already analyze myself to death after every social mistake. I did two years of therapy and I'm burnt out from discussing my childhood and professionals pathologizing me and pressuring me to mask harder for them so I make sense for them

thank you if you've read this far. I needed to vent and maybe hear your experiences if you were dismissed by psychiatrists eventually but got diagnosed in the end.";;;;
2025-08-24 20:12:19;A Guide for the Gentle Revolution;"I wrote this as a kind of offering—a poetic guide for a world in transition.

It speaks to unity, neurodivergence, the rise of the divine feminine, and the Earth’s microbiome as a mirror of our own inner ecosystems.

One section is especially close to my heart:

“Autistic people are not here to conform. We are here to guide. To challenge stagnation. To offer new ways of seeing, feeling, and being.”

I see autism not as a diagnosis, but as a kind of encoded wisdom. A sacred disruption.

I’d love to hear how others relate to this. Do you feel like you’re here to guide, to challenge, to reveal something deeper?                                                                   



 A Guide for the Gentle Revolution

 I. All Is One

There is no separation. Every breath, every tree, every heartbeat belongs to the same living tapestry. The illusion of division—between nations, races, beliefs—is the root of suffering. When we remember that all is one, war becomes absurd. Hatred loses its grip. The idea of “enemy” dissolves. To harm another is to harm oneself. To heal another is to heal the whole. This truth alone is enough to unravel the machinery of violence and fear.

 II. Autistic Souls as Shamans and Guides

Autistic people are not here to conform. We are here to guide. To challenge stagnation. To offer new ways of seeing, feeling, and being. We are the failsafe encoded in humanity’s design—keepers of pattern, rhythm, and truth. In a world addicted to noise and speed, we bring depth, clarity, and sacred disruption. Some of us walk as shamans, bridging worlds. Others simply live as reminders that difference is not deficiency—it is direction.

 III. The Rise of the Divine Feminine

Religion must evolve. The age of domination and hierarchy is ending. The Earth calls for balance—for the nurturing, intuitive, cyclical wisdom of the feminine. We must honor not only the sky, but the soil. Not only the father, but the mother. Misogyny and authoritarianism are the final spasms of a dying paradigm. What is rising now is wholeness: the sacred union of masculine and feminine in every being, every tree, every tide. Stewardship must replace conquest. Healing must replace control.



The Microbiome: A Mirror of the Earth

in and on the human body lives a vast ecosystem: trillions of microbes working in harmony. They digest, protect, communicate. They are not separate from us—they are us. When this balance is disturbed, disease emerges. The same is true of the planet. Strip the soil, poison the waters, silence the bees—and the Earth sickens.

Your gut is a rainforest. Your skin is a coral reef. Your breath is a wind that carries messages between worlds. The microbiome is a microcosm of Earth’s own living systems. Diversity is not decoration—it is survival. Stewardship begins within.



This guide is not a demand. It is an invitation. To soften. To listen. To remember. The revolution has already begun—not with fire, but with breath. Not with conquest, but with care.

i am hoping to reach the sleepers.";;;;
2025-08-24 04:15:38;Eternal fear I’m doing something wrong;"Hi all;

I wondered if anyone else related to this. I’m recently diagnosed in my 30s and I feel so alone. I have diagnosed OCD but after my recent autism diagnosis, it is very obvious to me that autism adds gas to the fire with ocd or is maybe the straight cause of it. My ocd relates to getting things wrong. Sometimes to a legal and dangerous end. My bottom line is that I always think I’m wrong, whatever I do, and whatever I do is always my very best. 

When I drive I worry I will hit someone or worse, that I’ve hit someone and didn’t notice. If I drive over a pot hole I can drive myself insane replaying the pot hole in my mind, until I start to doubt my own memories. 

I worry I’ve paid taxes incorrectly and I’ll get fined or taken to jail. 

I worry I said something offensive without realising (even though I haven’t) and it’ll come out and ruin my life. 

Even if I raise my voice to call my child down for dinner, I worry neighbours will think I’m a bad parent and report me for shouting. 

Ever since I was a kid, I’d see a police car and instantly feel like I’m sure I’ve done something without realizing I have and they’ll think I’m a bad person and nobody will believe that I’m good and would never do those things. 

I often think mail is fines or legal proceedings. For what?! I have no idea! I’ve never even so much as smoked a cigarette in my whole life! 

These are all quite extreme versions but this comes out in smaller ways too. 

IE- if I see people who are sort of quiet when they’re normally talkative, I’ll assume I must’ve said something and upset them and they aren’t telling me and now they aren’t speaking to me. 

If a friend doesn’t reply to my text I think the same. 

If my husband is cranky, I think the same, or start to analyze my relationship and decide he’s probably going to leave me because although I thought I was a good wife, I’m probably not. 

It is so hard living like this. This whole contrast of wanting to be alone and away from people but being so deeply terrified of being rejected and abandoned and ostracized is so tiring. 

I’m feeling so alone. It’s like “them and me” most of the time. Them being the rest of the world, me being in constant turmoil and concern unable to even enjoy a single thing because I’m sure at some point I’ll ruin it with ocd thoughts which means the enjoyable thing will turn out wrong or full of regret anyways. 

All I want to do is be a good person. I know deep down I am, and these worries are nonsensical but I can’t shake the thoughts.

2025-08-24 04:05:11;Autistic Erotica;"Cover wrap image for Spectrum of Desire.  Front cover is trippy rainbow, spine less so, back cover black.

I'm working on writing three stories right now.  Erotica isn't my specialty, so this is a decent challenge.  I'd love to have your help.

Submissions can be sent to jae.anderson@sasktel.net.  The deadline is Christmas Eve, 2025.

Payment for selected stories will be as a percentage of profits.  The better the book does, the better we all do.

If you are Autistic, with or without a formal diagnosis, and want to write 10 pages of erotica featuring Autistic characters, I'd love to hear from you.

I'm writing this book because Autistic people are so underrepresented in erotica and porn, and I figure it's time to put our mark on the genre.  Let's face it, Autism can make sex pretty awkward, and that's what I'd like to capture in this book.
Don't worry if you're not a professional writer--the right stories will get a thorough edit.  As far as theme goes, it's totally up to you.  Erotic comedy is just as good as hard-core smut, so use your imagination.  Stories can be 100% fiction, or based on a real-life experience.

Thanks, and please share this post.  DM me with any questions.";;;;
2025-08-23 09:53:22;Diagnosed at 25. How do I begin unmasking/self care?;"I’ve always been very aware of myself and I knew something was up but couldn’t pinpoint what. Now at 25, five years after i moved into a different country and culture, and 6 months into the diagnosis process, I got my results and the paper is coming Monday, but I had an hour long conversation with my doctor going over the diagnoses; AuDHD, GAD, Bipolar, MDD, PMDD… I feel like I’m collecting infinity stones. Even though I was told I would most likely get diagnosed autistic, I didn’t truly believe it until I heard it today. I’m realizing I have so much internalized ableism and shame. Even my doctor told me I have severe self esteem issues most likely stemming from trauma.

So I want to ask you, especially the people in my age bracket, what was your experience getting your diagnosis as an adult and how did you start taking care of yourself? I am really struggling with that right now and I’m in a transitional period where I just got my degree, broke up with my long term partner, and I need to start paying more bills than I already am.

I want to look for a job in my field but I feel like I barely know myself know so I keep thinking I’m unprepared and nobody will like me enough to hire me cause they can sense the tism and I’m so tired of masking?

I have no good support system so any advice or just knowing your story would help :c";;;;

2025-08-23 03:56:17;How to deal with job shaming, judgements made because you’re not where you’re “supposed” to be.;"So I recently encountered this with my boyfriend’s family. I’m 38 and recently I was working in a grocery store. Evidently this was a sign that I was a loser and not a good person, and some kind of danger to their son. 

I was kicked out unceremoniously at 18 by my mom and left to fend for myself with no diagnosis until my 30s, no life skills and severe trauma. I have had panic disorder since childhood. I have traumatic brain injury from a physically abusive dad (a lot of blows to the head leading to blackouts) and being hit by a car on a busy road as a pedestrian. I went through unimaginable abuse growing up, up to the point I left the house. I have a learning disability as well. Despite all of this, I have successfully navigated myself out of homelessness and trauma induced psychosis, have lived a stable life free of drugs and alcohol, have my own place, and a very calm and peaceful life. 

I’ve always struggled with work but I always find ways to sustain myself. I worked all through the pandemic. I work full time now making decent money and have lived in my own apartment for almost a decade. I’m a lifelong learner and have a library of hundreds of books. I haven’t been able to complete college yet but I’ve never given up trying. When I was taking classes, I turned in A grade work, I just haven’t been able to complete my terms due to unaddressed/unmanaged adhd. Every therapist and doctor I’ve ever worked with said I have beat remarkable odds and typically they don’t see patients who do as well as I am, with similar backgrounds. I go out of my way to help people in need, to the extent of my resources. Yet I am still being called a worthless loser by complete strangers (parents refused to get to know me). They are pushing bf to date others, his mother literally installed a dating app and wants to “find him someone better”. Does anyone else have a similar experience? Words of wisdom? ";;;;
2025-08-23 03:43:41;Flying under the radar;"I was diagnosed with autism (female) at age 31. As a child, I preferred to play alone — I lined up my toys and VHS tapes in a specific order, if I noticed from a distance that someone messed my system up I would get up and correct it. I would have anxiety attacks if plans changed suddenly or if I was late for school. I was hyper-fixated on specific artists or books to the point to the point that it was all would talk about. I needed to wear specific clothing because it just felt right. I always felt extremely uncomfortable talking to adults because I couldn’t figure out how to mirror them so I would avoid eye contact and stay ‘shy’.

I feel relief after being diagnosed but a part of the healing journey is grieving and forgiving the inner child. I was always conscious that I operated different than my peers around me, but as I got older it became more prominent and problematic. I learned that alcohol and substances helped me feel more comfortable and free in social settings. I have experienced many friendships and relationships where I didn’t realize I was falling into an entanglement of lies and abuse because I didn’t see the ‘red flags’ and warning signs.

Since my diagnosis I’ve been working through the unmasking process to self-advocate and heal. I created a journal with prompts to help me reflect on how to find myself and create an authentic life after a late-diagnosis. If this is something you would be interested in seeing, I created a small Etsy shop to offer this content to others. This unmasking journal is one of a few workbooks and tools that I am starting to create for other neurodivergent folks. I am going to drop a link and would love any community support in the sense of giving my shop a like or a follow. If you’re interested in the unmasking journal I am happy to share this content, I don’t want to pay wall it for those who would benefit. This is a digital product that can be purchased. If this doesn’t feel financially accessible send me a message and I am happy to share it!

2025-08-22 23:09:21;Burnout?;"Hi, 

Not officially diagnosed yet-but heavily suspecting it and working to get an official assessment. 

I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder since I was 8 ish years old, I'm 24 now. For context

I've been in uni for 4 years now, and the last couple of years I experienced this weird, apathetic exhaustion, or a lack of interest that came out of nowhere and had a hard time getting out of the house to go to class. I've now created a bit of a tough situation for myself academically and that's sucked, but I'm having a hard time explaining to people what happened. 

I wouldn't really call it depression, or anxiety, though those ""feelings"" have come up as a result of whatever else could be the root of it. 

I'm wondering if this sort of apathetic burnout feeling is an autism thing? I'm at a loss for why I suddenly stopped being able to bring myself to do it. I'm convinced it isn't purely depression, because my excitement and interest in other things is still very much there.  

It feels like this hard to explain feelinf that I can't really put into words, but all of a sudden school has become this thing that feels overwhelming and frustrating, when it was something I loved so much. 

It doesn't seem like regular burnout, because I wasn't going too hard or pushing it too far at all.idk

Any insight would be appreciated";;;;
2025-08-21 20:08:38;Suddenly my whole life makes sense lol - question at the end;"I've been waiting for several months to get my tween daughter assessed for autism. We kept having fights and miscommunications about stuff. What's logical to me is not logical to her. We clash on so many things and I was having a hard time seeing things from her point of view. She takes things so literally! After this one fight, it dawned on me, is she on the spectrum? 

I started researching how autism can present in girls and my daughter was checking all the boxes!  I've been researching autism for months, trying to learn how to be the best parent I can for her.

In my research I realized my father is absolutely on the spectrum! All these different things started to click into place. And then someone asked me if I noticed any traits in myself. I hadn't really thought about it because I wasn't analyzing myself. I started doing more research. Holy shit, I'm definitely on the spectrum as well lol!!

What do I do with this information? Do I get a formal diagnosis? I'm 38 years old. I have 15 years of therapy under my belt. I already have a bipolar diagnosis, (which I'm starting to question if that's even correct,) so do I need to do anything with this information? 

Another question: I am a socks-on person and my daughter is a socks-off person. We're just very different people. Is it common for two people on the spectrum to clash in each other's company? I assumed birds of a feather would flock together. I'm the only one in the family that understands my dad's way of doing things. Why don't I connect like that with my daughter?";;;;
2025-08-21 15:23:39;Desperate;"I have a 32 year old son who served in the US military for 12 years, but s he was promoted & given more authority his ability to mask failed him. He just couldn't function. He was diagnosed ASD, ADHD, Intense anxiety disorders, etc...  And since Covid19 he has severe chronic fatigue and pain. And he's developed Cushing's syndrome & Metabolic imbalances. He has a psychiatrist and therapist. But we live in the middle of downtown  and he needs friends. 

Does anyone have any ideas for him? He's sweet, loyal, kind and passionate.  I am disabled and I can't do enough for him. We are fortunate enough to have a place to live and we have disability benefits. But it's not a lot. His obsession is collecting hot wheels cars. 

I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks. ";;;;

2025-08-21 06:54:46;Feeling emotional and insecure after my eval;"I had my eval earlier this week and will get results in a few weeks. I’m feeling a confusing and unexpected mix of emotions. 

I thought I would feel better after completing it but I just feel a lot of anxiety that he will say I’m not autistic. I didn’t think I cared either way, I just wanted answers as to why I struggle so much. 

But now I am realizing that a diagnosis would be so validating to the part of me that wants a reason for why I am the way I am. I’m so nervous he will tell me I’m just anxious, just depressed, just ADHD (I am definitely all of those things). Or worse, he might tell me I’m none of those things which would be a nightmare because I know that I am.

If the latter happens, I’m scared that the results could invalidate my entire experience. I’m having major imposter syndrome on all fronts. 

Being tested so rigorously, at times using multiple choice questionnaires, feels so vulnerable because there is no room for nuance or explanation. What if I answered in a way that portrays me inaccurately? What if I did a poor job assessing my own experience?

I’m feeling so insecure.

";;;;
2025-08-20 22:55:07;Post due to desperation;"Hello everyone, I suspect most people here don't like seeing this type of posts, but I'm feeling a very embarrassing kind of desperation for validation, and perhaps there are people who can relate to that feeling. Unfortunately, I currently live in a country that is not very educated on ASD, and especially for me as a 15F that suspects low support needs autism, it would be especially hard to get any recognition. As for my parents, they're the kind that don't believe in mental disorders or disabilities in their own children. And their knowledge on ASD is very limited as well due to the fact that the only autistic person they know is my male cousin who suffers from high support needs autism and is nonverbal. I am now going to list some of the things that make me suspect autism:

((In childhood))

• Need for predictability, going as far as wanting to control my environment and the people surrounding me

• Having 'meltdowns' when things wouldn't go my way (e.g, hiding away in corners and crying over specific things)

• Touch sensitivity — especially when it came to skin-to-skin contact

• Texture sensitivity in food — refusing any food that I wasn't familiar with, therefore developing an unhealthy diet that lead to me being underweight

• (Depending on memory) Kind of blunt way of speaking and not controlling what I said, HAVE gotten in trouble for doing so in the past

• Sometimes just inappropriate in social situations, especially while trying to make friends

• Used to be ridiculously oblivious to things people were saying or doing, which, I suppose is also called social cues

• Issues with change, leading to extreme burnout when I changed schools that clearly affected my former 'Straight A student and gifted' reputation

• Having the 'hoarder mindset', especially with things I collected (stuffed animals)

• Honestly just feeling really alien compared to others, I never had any 'real' friends until 7th grade

• Copying the way others act and speak

• And lastly, a fact that I'm not sure whether it's a symptom, but when describing me as a toddler/young child, my parents ALWAYS point out the fact that I used to be painfully hyperactive. Not sure whether that’s relevant

(Current life)

• Immense social anxiety, I basically can't work or navigate in social situations, which is why I worry that I won't have an independent future

• Another aspect that further increases my worries is the fact that I need really specific and dumbed down instructions to work socially, which I am sometimes too afraid to ask for

• Remaining and increased touch/texture sensitivity + diagnosed loudness hyperacusis

• Safe food that I probably wouldn’t survive without

• Still ongoing, horrible relationship with change

• Stimming

• Need for predictability, routines (that I used to call 'traditions' until I informed myself on ASD) and need for control of my environment

• I was really told that I look unapproachable from the outside which is why my classmates tend to avoid me

• Being compared to a robot by friends and my father

• I feel very intensely, which is something I also read about in this subreddit. Happiness, for example, physically feels like adrenaline (idk how to explain)

• Six-year long interest in inazuma eleven (and general, huge interest in science and philosophy, with specific topics I especially love)

Basically, that's all I can spontaneously think of. The thing that is giving me impostor syndrome is the fact that I don't have any serious struggles with understanding social cues anymore. I can read emotions and body language, in fact, I think of it as a side hobby of mine, as I like observing and analyzing people and trying to predict their thoughts and behavior. I do take some idioms literally, but I don't struggle with irony or sarcasm. I've been told that I'm sarcastic myself. But that's basically everything that’s been bothering me and I just needed to get this off my chest.";;;;
2025-08-20 21:45:11;Social Anxiety Vs Autism;"So… I (25F) was diagnosed in 2023 with social anxiety, which felt somewhat weird to me as I thrive on social interaction and honestly struggle being alone. So ever since then I had been working with doctors and my counselor to see if I might have been misdiagnosed and actually have Autism. Everyone except me and my mother are diagnosed or assumed by doctors to have autism, and with much talking with my counselor, there are beliefs where even my mother may range on the spectrum, and it would only make sense that I have autism too. 

So about 3 weeks ago I had a consultation to be retested, and it was somewhat disheartening as I felt my doctor had his doubts and wasn’t really taking my concerns seriously. But after doing some paperwork with my mother, I realized that there are some symptoms of autism that are vital for a diagnosis that I just don’t have.

Now, my counselor has told me, that even if I don’t get a diagnosis, that doesn’t mean I don’t have autism. I could just be outside of the range to register on the clinical spectrum. But the more I think about it, the more I think I may actually have Social Anxiety. I mean just because I have social anxiety, doesn’t mean I wouldn’t thrive of social interactions. Right?

Is it wrong to think I might have both? Obviously I would have more problems with the social anxiety stuff than autism, but I’m curious to find out what the kind people of Reddit have learned on their journeys.";;;;
2025-08-20 17:12:39;I think most of autism tests suck and are made by allistic people;"I’m talking about those questionnaires like the AQ. For context I recently found out (m, 43), self diagnosed with ongoing diagnosis, high masker/non stereotypical austism. 

So many questions are “it depends”. Like the classic “would you rather go to a library than to a party?”  
How many people are there? If its like 3-4 people i like its fine and also when i think about my childhood library it was ugly af and dusty and not nice in general. So this is just an example and I know the question is camouflaging the “are you social or are you rather by yourself” but i feel like i have to decipher every question before i answer. Therefore having at least a decent amount of knowledge of the concept of autism itself to answer properly. It took me months to understand that i have sensory issues because because my body reacts to those sensory issues but its not like my brain is screaming every time because I have a hard time feeling stuff in real time. 

The literal thinking makes it hard to assess. At first i was like well i don’t scream and have a meltdown when someone shines a bright light in my faces so i probably don’t have an issue. I often compare the outward facing reaction to mine but most of my stuff is internalized. But then i noticed i habe stickers on all the standby led, i use dimmable lights, prefer indirect light and basically never turn on lights when I go to the bathroom at night and get irritated by the horrible xenon lights by other cars a lot. 

Also like with imagination. I have nothing to compare it too so how tf do I know whether it is good or bad. I need more context. 

So what i am trying to say is the more i understand myself and the more I know about autism the better I can answer those questions. The imposter in me tells me that is cheating lol. 

Now I just start ranting lol. 

Tl;dr i find those questions hard to answer without knowing a lot about autism, have good self awareness, literal thinking is not helping and some simply lack diversity of different traits of the spectrum. 

EDIT: I have not only done them by myself but also as part of my assessment with a therapist present and my opinion about them remains the same.";;;;
2025-08-20 05:44:34;Does anyone else not feel “ready” to work?;"Does anyone else not feel “ready” to work?

Hello all. I hope you are having a good day. I am posting here today because I have been working with vocational rehab in my state for about 7+ years now. The goal of vocational rehab (for those that don’t know) is to help someone with disabilities find employment. I started with them around the time I finished high school. I went to college for several years but ended up dropping out due to my disability (besides autism, which I was only diagnosed with about two years ago). They helped me pay for books and materials etc. Anyhow, over the years,  they have helped me find a few internships (and I also found a few internships on my own). Unfortunately this has not led to any long lasting jobs. Most recently, I have been looking for part time remote work. This is because this is what I feel comfortable with at this moment. It is also because I live in a rural area and don’t drive. Anyhow, vocational rehab just told me recently that they don’t think me looking for a remote job is working out. They think I should try and find an “in person” Part Time job (or even in person volunteering - which I don’t want to do because I won’t get paid). The problem with that is that I would rely on my parents for transportation. (There is no Uber/Lyft where l live). And the other problem is that I DO NOT feel comfortable with the idea of an in person job. I’m honestly beginning to wonder if I feel ready to work or not. Some part of me thinks no. But at the same time, I don’t want to spend my whole life getting SSI/SSDI. (Which so far I’ve been denied for). What would you do if you were me? I suppose I want a job, but only if it’s on
My terms (remote, part time etc) and not until I feel ready. Vocational rehab says that if I don’t start to make progress soon, they can just close my case (which again I don’t want them to do!) I personally don’t see how that is fair! It’s not my fault that I have an anxiety disorder and don’t feel “ready” to be employed. I have tried to tell them This before too, but they just keep pushing me it seems. 

I honestly just don’t know what to do! Does anyone either feel the same way or have any advice for me? I would greatly appreciate it! ";;;;
2025-08-20 03:56:44;For anyone who needs to show their doctor/psych this;"In case they claim “if you had ASD, it would have been caught in childhood.”

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20345841/

“Results: Fifty-five percent of children with autistic traits at the same levels as those who had an autism diagnosis had not been identified as needing extra support from education or specialised health services.”

“Conclusions: The results suggest that there may be a substantial proportion of children on the autistic spectrum who are never identified by services.” (Russell, Ford, Steer & Golding, 2010)

‘Substantial’ here means, once again, 55%. A majority.

They probably won’t listen. But at least you can correct their statement with a factually-supported one:
“If you had ASD, it MIGHT have been caught in childhood… maybe.”

Edit: In other words, if there were a diagnostic measure with 45% sensitivity, would they consider it reliable?";;;;
2025-08-20 00:27:28;Stuck;"Hey guys, so I’m in a bit of a ditch right now. Let me give you some context; I withdrew from the college I committed to because it didn’t feel right. Now I’m going to go to community college since I can be close to home and have less expectations than if I was on my own. Basically, I’m pretty sure I have PDA, so you can imagine how every day life looks for me; I can barely do ‘simple’ tasks, even talking can feel like a demand sometimes…it’s really a lot. And the worst part is that my parents do not understand and even though I’ve tried to explain it all to them, they are all like “using diagnosis as a crutch,” or they’ll say something like “We don’t claim that you’re __” Like, no????? I do need a diagnosis and it’s okay to acknowledge that?? But anyways.

So, I have nothing diagnosed (save for Unspecified Lack of Coordination, which most likely needs to be reevaluated), and as you can see that can be difficult because for college, even community college, I need documentation for most accommodations. 
This is where it gets kind of hard to explain so bear with me 😅. 

I need to actually apply for college. I’ve finished the application and I’m just waiting for one thing, but it took me like two months to even do that. Which could’ve taken me one hour😭. It just felt soooo demanding. I also need to pick classes but that can be hard too if I see it as a demand. But also, I need to try and get things diagnosed. That takes money. It’s hard for me to get a job because I don’t always understand instructions and need very clear ones, and I’m socially anxious. So my parents need to be involved if I need financial help, but I’m not sure if I can try for a diagnosis with them because of their views. Since community college gives me lots of time to figure things out, I want to think about a service animal. That leaves me back to my previous point; I need help from my parents, but they’re not understanding or supportive. I should try to be independent, but that’s very hard because of a variety of factors.

So, I’m really stuck 😭 if anyone has any kind words or advice I’d really appreciate it!!! ";;;;
2025-08-19 02:29:04;How do you know if you're autistic or a narcissist?;"I'm formally diagnosed with level 1 ASD, but when I read *Unmasking Autism,* it states autistic people are often misdiagnosed with NPD.

But wouldn't that mean those with NPD are often misdiagnosed with autism?  I know not necessarily, but it makes sense.

But what fucks with me is I know mental health professionals are ethically obligated to withhold diagnoses or observations they believe would cause more harm than benefit to the client.  So while I see a therapist and psychiatrist, they very well could have decided it could be harmful to inform me they've noticed narcissistic traits.  Would *I* tell a client with chronic depression and passive suicidal ideation they had NPD? 

**Why I might have NPD:**

I experience **very little love** for strangers.  Some might call it ""empathy,"" but I don't think that's accurate because I might feel their pain but not *care.*. I care deeply for those close to me, but if I, say, hear about a school shooting, I'm mostly just annoyed I keep hearing about it when I want them to get back to playing music on the radio.  

People largely annoy me.  I can play nice to get what I want (e.g., maintaining employment), but I largely see them as selfishly entitled to my time and energy by trying to use me to satisfy their social needs with frivolous smalltalk.  I can usually tolerate it and participate, but when I'm tired or stressed, I'm prone to lashing out at them.

I ignore my neighbors, or really people in general unless I'm directly interacting with them.  Like if I'm in a store, I'm looking straight ahead and won't look at the people around me.  Or if I pass someone walking, I'll pretend they don't exist.

I think I'm smarter than most people.

I am prone to rumination, almost constantly.

I am very prone to boredom (although I guess that's more antisocial PD than NPD).  I have to constantly keep myself busy.  I quit my last job because I was too bored and ended up abusing alcohol and becoming very suicidal and have been unemployed for the past year as a result. 

I struggle to maintain employment: my average job lasts less than 6 months because of interpersonal issues.  

I have 0 friends, and when I do hang out with people, I often with that I hadn't because again, most people annoy me.

I often find myself inadvertently bragging during conversations.  It's typically something at the time I just thought would be an interesting thing to tell someone, like that I hike 4 miles multiple times each week.  But then I look back on it and am like, *Wow, they probably thought I was trying to brag.*

**Reasons I might not be**

I don't feel entitled to things and am very annoyed by people who do.  E.g., I wouldn't cut in line even if there were no consequences.  I would kill myself before I'd steal something (or maybe that's another sign in favor, as it could be an arrogance thing).

I largely dislike being complimented.  I find it annoying and uncomfortable (or maybe that's another sign in favor).

Does the intelligence thing count if it's empirically supported?  I'm finishing a master's degree and have made straight A's since middle school, largely with very little effort.  When I do my coursework, I feel like Dr. House on clinic duty.  I made a 32 on the ACT without studying.  And I have to pretend tests or whatever are hard when my classmates talk about them so they don't all hate me.  So I think there is ample evidence it is in fact easier for me to learn and understand things than it is for the vast majority of people.

I typically know someone's a narcissist because I strongly dislike them for no tangible reason.  (But again, could be a sign in favor: maybe I dislike them because they're too much like me).

2025-08-19 00:05:20;Just got diagnosed at 27 and I’m realizing I will never be «normal»;"I’m having mixed feelings about my diagnosis. I have always struggled with my mental health and an autism diagnosis gives an answer to everything. 
But it makes me sad thinking that I will never be «normal». The only thing I have been wanting to be all my life, and its not possible for me. It’s hitting me hard knowing I will always feel like I’m «less» and weird, the feeling will never go away. At least now I know why. There is some good in that I guess.";;;;
2025-08-18 11:53:56;anyone else just act out scenarios or convos by themselves?;"i talk to myself very often when i’m by myself, but i noticed that i will often play pretend. i will create scenarios in my head, and imagine myself in those scenarios. for example, i was simply doing the dishes at home by myself, and i was talking aloud to myself, but i was acting as if i were having a conversation with a friend of mine about what we might do for my birthday. 

it was like i was almost acting it out for the future? but not to relieve anxiety about the conversation, but because it was just… fun. i do it a lot, and it’s something i’ve always noticed i’ve done. i’ll watch youtube videos if my favorite creators or streamers, and i will pretend that i’m there with them, hanging out or sitting next to them while they stream or something. it’s not like i think i’m actually there, i’m very much aware that i’m pretending. 

i’m not sure why i do this. my imagination has always been very vivid and immersive, which hasn’t always been the most positive thing. 

as a self identified/diagnosed, high masking individual, i’m really curious. do other ppl with autism do this as well? (not saying it’s a trait, just curious!)

2025-08-18 11:43:14;School avoidance;"I‘m diagnosed autistic (lvl 2) and my daughter recently received an ASD diagnosis as well (also lvl 2), but I’m struggling to understand some aspects of her behaviour, or know how to respond. I have had a call from her school because she’s refusing to go to class and saying she is in “excruciating pain“ but has taken Panadol and their observation is that she is not in any physical pain (No guarded movements, no tensed body posture etc). She is absolutely refusing to go to class, eat or drink and won’t talk to anyone. Unfortunately she tends to lash out rather than implode (i’m the opposite), and I am struggling to try and help school find strategies that don’t exacerbate the issue.

i believe the source of her distress is social. She’s finding peer dynamics at school and away from school a lot, and unfortunately doesn’t always use the best strategies for dealing with that, but blames everyone else for all the issues when it’s usually more complex than that. e.g. she was very angry this morning that an autistic girl in her class never replies to her texts or calls, but all term 1 and 2 this girl was really upset because my daughter wouldn’t sit with her at lunch but she puts all the blame on the other girl. I’m not blaming my daughter, but it’s challenging when she has such an absolute view and she wants everyone to take her exact perspective.

The challenge is that school want her to find a healthier way of expressing what she’s feeling than hiding in sickbay, but I feel a bit helpless looking on. I always just shoved my feelings down and imploded in private, so her behaviour is a bit of a mystery to me.

is this something anyone has any insight into? Sorry if I sound uncaring, I think it’s pure exhaustion on my part. I was homeschooled but am not in a position to do so. I do realise school is very exhausting but I thought she’d been doing better.";;;;

2025-08-18 08:45:33;Trying to plan a wedding while also figuring out my diagnosis.;"I am beyond thrilled to marry my partner and am I really am looking to our wedding day. 

But oh howdy did I underestimate this planning thing. I usually love event planning and I’m hyper organized in many ways. I thought this would be something I would really succeed in. But I’ve just felt lost. So many people tell you to plan a wedding for yourself and do whatever you want to do. But I have no idea what that is. I be reached several steps of burnout a few times already. 

For over a year now I’ve been actively considering an AuDHD diagnosis. While not official, I have scored high on RADs and the CAT tests. I have sensory sensitivities and have internalized way too much at this point. 

All of that coming together into a storm of, who am I and what do I want? Why can’t I do this thing? I want to do the thing, but every step feels like an ever growing mountain of small tasks that I don’t have an answer for. 

I’m so tired and overwhelmed. I shut down when I start thing about florals and seating charts and all these expectations that I’m trying to learn about. I don’t have enough wedding experience to navigate this and I don’t know how to communicate what I need to other people to get things done. 

Just figuring it all out. ";;;;
2025-08-18 03:38:14;ASD With Above Average Emotional Intelligence?;"Hey everyone! I was recently diagnosed with Level 1 ASD, which honestly makes a lot of sense in hindsight. It hadn’t really been suspected before, though, because I’ve always been known for having pretty strong emotional intelligence, especially as a kid. I was very empathetic, could easily take other people’s perspectives, and often picked up on things that even adults seemed to miss (maybe partly due to pattern recognition). I didn’t struggle much with nonverbal behavior (expecept for social cues and eye contact)—in fact, I was probably hypersensitive to it. As an adult, I’ve noticed (and been told) that I have a way of understanding people deeply and making them feel comfortable enough to be their true selves.

I am not saying that I do not have any issues with connecting with others. For the most part, I had very little interest in other people (especially as a child) and preferred to spend most of the time playing by myself. I had friends, but usually the other children initiated these friendships, or they happened spontaneously, but I barely ever took the initiative. Most people drain my social battery quickly. I HATE small talk with a passion. I often do not know what to say or do, especially in groups and, as mentioned above, dislike eye contact for the most part. And I typically do not understand why I struggled to make friends, while others got along so easily.

I hope I do not appear condescending. Just to be clear, I’m not suggesting autistic people lack empathy. What I find interesting is the contrast: growing up, I was often praised for for my emotional awareness, and that actually pushed me toward a career in psychology. But at the same time, I’ve always struggled socially. I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar?";;;;
2025-08-17 12:24:10;Diagnosed recently, but I disagree with the diagnosis?;"Hello! My psychiatrist diagnosed me but I find that I disagree with the diagnosis mostly because I feel like i am a few points off from meeting the criteria. I don't struggle with maintaining relationships. I don't have difficulty with context shifting etc.

Some of her points as to why she diagnosed me:
- how intense my emotions can escalate under stress, to the point where I start hitting my head
- feeling drained from lights and noise
- having to pretend I'm interested in conversation I'm not personally interested in, and then finding social interaction to be exhausting (just having to nod is tiring after some time). But I do enjoy social chit chat from time to time.
- I can make eye contact except as the conversation goes on, my eyes start to wander somewhere else. I just listen better if I'm looking somewhere else
- stims like picking nails, rocking in my chair, pacing when I'm telling a story
- having fixated interests at different points in my life , but I never infodump about these 
- my rejection sensitivity
- She says I'm not the best at reading between the lines

When I got home I took some online tests like the AQ, RAADS R, and the Aspie Quiz. I've only seemed to meet the threshold for the RAADS R, but that score itself is still pretty low! I also think I'm pretty good at reading social cues? 

Now for the next session, I'm meant to bring my mom so she could explain to her about me being autistic, but since I disagree I'm not quite sure what to do. Thoughts???";;;;

2025-08-17 05:29:36;I’m trying to get back up… but it’s harder than I thought;"I moved an 7 hour drive away from my immediate family in VA, and now require a flight to see family for Christmas (my parents are both from NY with a close extended family and travel to NY for Christmas EVERY YEAR). I met my wonderful husband 8 years ago here in Ohio which is a large reason we’ve not left the state. When I moved here, I was a young 20 something that was obsessed with hiking/camping in the Shenandoah and was a pretty social city dweller. 

About a year before I moved to Ohio I was finally diagnosed with adhd (and later on Asperger’s). This has been its own long and difficult journey. Then came the ruthlessness of dealing with discrimination in the capitalist hell hole of my jobs. 

I soon quickly realized one of the major differences between living in VA vs OH is that I no longer have access to my outlets that allow me to climb mountains and swim in the James River. Outlets that were imperative to my capacity for resilience. 

My spirit is not what it used to be, and my light continues to dim over time. And now this year, my new job will not approve the PTO to see my family for Christmas. I don’t have anywhere to hike in the area because of how flat it is. No clean natural sources of water. I don’t particularly desire to make friends in the area  because I can’t meet the friendship expectations of neurotypicals; my family’s immigrant ties run very deep, creating an extra large cultural and neurodivergent personality gap to fill. I have never been successful keeping long term friendships, so why waste everybody’s time— ya know? 


——————————————-


TLDR: the longer I go without my recharging sources of family and the outdoors, the greater my executive functioning challenges become. And I get to combine this with the hopelessness of the fascist take over of capitalism. 

I can’t regularly feed myself everyday, clean the house or do laundry. Then I can’t emotionally regulate myself. It’s such a vicious cycle. ";;;;
2025-08-17 00:52:55;I've been saying I have autism for a few years now, but recently the anxiety of the self diagnosis is eating me alive;"pretty much what the title says; after years of wondering what was wrong with me and why I didn't act like the other kids, I found a group of diagnosed autistic friends, and when I said I was thinking I might have it they basically just peer reviewed me and said that they thought I already knew- that combined with the traits I've been able to pick out within myself after having something I can say it is rather than something being 'wrong' and the fact my family both have traits and a few have been diagnosed makes me almost completely sure I have it(that and my very high score on that one test that apparently the professionals use, I was up to 218 if that counts for anything). Recently in an attempt to better my mental health I've been using resources and stuff for people with autism, and it's made my life a lot easier and I've been able to mostly calm my meltdowns - only issue is that because I can mask almost completely it's made me question if I even have it or if I'm just being dramatic, if I should even be saying I have it when I haven't been formally tested. I know it's super hard for high masking people to be taken seriously though, and I've seen it worse for afabs as well, so I'm not sure I'd even get a diagnosis if I went in even if I'm so sure of it, even with the anxiety and imposter syndrome getting me.  
  
I just need some outside support in this, someone that aren't my close friends to assure me I'm okay to continue using the resources and being in the community";;;;
2025-08-16 22:10:10;‘Many ASD traits’ but no diagnosis;"Hi everyone, I’m 25 (UK, female). My 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with autism this year — she showed traits from 12 months and was referred at 2. While researching to support her, I kept finding myself saying “that sounds like me.” I’ve always felt different but assumed it was my OCD (diagnosed 2023) and anxiety (diagnosed 2018).

I went to my GP who referred me through Right to Choose for autism/ADHD assessment. After filling in the forms (my sister helped, as my mum isn’t good with paperwork), I was surprised it only took 3 months to get an appointment. I was 99% sure I’m autistic and hoped for clarity.

The assessment was a 40-minute video call with an older woman. She read questions from a list, I answered, and she moved straight on — no follow-ups, no scenarios, nothing like what friends or others online described. At the end she said I show “many autistic traits” but couldn’t give a diagnosis. I’m heartbroken.

She based this partly on what my sister wrote and a few of my answers. For context: as a child I was confident, talked to anyone, wandered off with strangers, didn’t struggle much with parties. At school I had one main friend and preferred my own company, though I could work in groups. I was a teacher’s pet. But secondary school was a huge struggle. I masked to fit in, completely changing myself at a new school after being bullied. I had “friends” but none felt real — just versions of me I created to be accepted.

I strongly believe I’ve been denied a diagnosis because I wasn’t a stereotypical autistic child. I disclosed my OCD and she said my routines must be from that. I also mentioned I’d been struggling with my mental health lately and see a private counsellor. Her advice? That I should exercise more — even though I already go to the gym 4 times a week. I left feeling dismissed and fobbed off.

The criteria she seemed to use felt outdated — like I was being assessed as if I were a 10-year-old boy. Autism presents differently in women and I don’t think that was considered.

I spoke to my counsellor the next day (she also does autism/ADHD screenings, though not diagnoses). She actually asked in our very first session if I’d ever been assessed. After I explained what happened, she said it sounded like not much thought had gone into it and that she disagrees with the outcome. She’s offered to write me a supporting letter once I get my clinic notes so I can go back to my GP for a second opinion.

Right now I feel lost and confused. How can I have “many autistic traits” but no diagnosis? I was so sure this would finally explain my life. Instead, I feel stuck in limbo and like I haven’t been taken seriously.";;;;
2025-08-16 06:57:30;Benfits of diagnosis?;"Hello
What are the benefits of an official diagnosis? I've seen this question before and mostly people answered what they got out from the realization that they are autistic rather than the official diagnosis. But I already had the realization and got a lot out of it.
Realizing I'm probabably autistic helped me a lot to understand myself better and make adaptions in my life accordingly; but most importantly it helped me to accept myself better and be kinder to myself.  
I'm mostly functioning on the outside but I sturggle on the inside, what support /benefits are there in for somone like that?
I realize the answer to my question most probably is access to therapy. So what did you get out of therapy? I have difficulties opening up to other people and prefer to deal with things on my own.
The process of a diagnosis seems very exhausting an Im not sure its worth it. 
First time poster an d no an english native speaker so please be kind. I appreciate your insights.";;;;

I was wondering how any of you have regained any sort of confidence after being diagnosed. I had more when I didn't know I was. sure it read as arrogance and rude and all the other bad things.

I have a partner (luck) and I'm making art again but I think when it comes to social things I'm beyond scared. I know I cant like do what they want even if I know What people expect.

2025-08-15 03:16:00;Do You Have Uncommon Special Interests?;"Hey Guys! I was wondering what your special interests are and if you have any, which may be considered uncommon? I only got diagnosed with ASD a few weeks ago. And until my assessment I was not aware I had special interests because my most predominant special interest is a rather broad theme and probably not a common interest in the ASD community (but feel free to me prove me otherwise).

Since I was a child I’ve always loved TV shows and music, but I liked researching the people behind them just as much — musicians, actors, the history of shows, and all sorts of pop culture news. I like spotting pop culture references in rap music, and I used to know the names of every single Disney Channel actor by heart when I was a child. Every time I watch a tv show or listen to a new album, I look forward to researching them afterwards. My boyfriend's sister even made me a customized pop culture quiz game because it was my strong suit whenever we played Trivial Pursuit together.

Feel free to share your (uncommon) special interests :)";;;;
2025-08-14 23:29:56;Got my ADHD & ASD diagnosis… but the mixed test results won’t stop bothering me;"Hey guys! I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger syndrome (which is still the official term where I live). At first, both diagnoses felt like a huge relief. But over time, my feelings changed. I started questioning the accuracy of my ASD diagnosis, especially because my test results were so mixed.

Now, that uncertainty takes up a large part of my everyday thoughts. And yes, I’m painfully aware of the irony here: I’m questioning my diagnosis because it wasn’t perfectly clear, while knowing that a need for accuracy and certainty is one of my more prominent autistic traits.

It's not like I disagree with the diagnosis, it's just that I wish the test results had been clearer, I think. 

Has anyone else experienced this after their diagnosis? ";;;;
2025-08-14 09:39:07;Does a diagnosis help?;"I have often suspected I have mild autism but my understanding was that it isn’t treatable. Because of that and because of the extreme social stigma, I avoided it like the plague and reassured myself that I do not have it. 

I was the same way with ADHD but finally had to get that treated because I couldn’t continue untreated and was really beginning to have my life fall apart. I still am kind of disturbed at having that diagnosis but it was helpful because I have resources that really help and have improved my life and future prospects. 

My therapist recently said it sounds like I might have autism and was kind of surprised when I began sobbing uncontrollably. I was having a rough week and was just really exhausted and burned out and discouraged already—I manage several chronic physical conditions that together make life really hard on me in ways that aren’t seen as really valid or acceptable, and have been also trying to manage the ADHD which is a lot of effort. And this was the final straw. 

To me knowing I have autism feels like a serious death sentence. I know it doesn’t make a difference if it’s just a label. It’s just that because my childhood was so dysfunctional and bizarre, and because I’ve only been out on my own for under a decade, I had really kept myself going by thinking I could catch up to my peers by putting in the work. I feel like if I have autism it means I am always going to be isolated and rejected by others, and never get to a point in life where I’m fighting tooth and nail in every aspect just to survive. Everything is already so hard and if I am fundamentally really wired differently than most people because of a condition that isn’t treatable and is used as a joke and an insult, I just don’t even see the point. I am so worn out and life just feels like a slog with no light at the end of the tunnel. 

I have met quite a few people with autism and had actually hoped we could connect and get along but so far I have dealt with just as much disconnection and misunderstanding with autistic people as with everyone else. So it’s not like an “autism card” will give me access to people I can socialize with that will go any differently than all my other attempts. And I already work in software so it’s not like it’s going to help me fit in better at work if I can lean into it. I’m the outlier even as a programmer. 

But a lot of people seek diagnoses and talk about their conditions and seem to find it meaningful, so that makes me think maybe I’m missing some aspect of it. Are there like coping classes you can take? What is the point of knowing you have autism or Asperger’s? ";;;;
2025-08-14 05:37:11;Excruciating muscle pains during autistic burnout - anyone able to help or relate ?;"Hello everybody,

I am here to ask for your help, because my family doctor is at a loss, and my psychiatrist is also at a loss. They know very little about autism, and there aren't many autism specialists in my country and they're all far away from me.

I am 34, and I just got diagnosed as AuDHD back in May. 

I am also going through autistic burnout, and lately there's been something new that might be one of its manifestations, but I'm not sure.

The evening and the day following any prolonged social interaction face to face (prolonged here meaning more than 15 minutes), I have unbearable pains in the whole top part of my body. Everything above my hips fucking hurts like hell. And with the pain, there's an extreme weakness. Think : can't-even-open-a-bottle-of-fruit-juice weak (the bottle had already been opened before, there was no reason for any struggle).

It's as if my whole body was tensed at the very extreme to which it could tense up, every movement becomes a struggle, and the pain radiates through my neck, my shoulders, my belly, my arms, all the way into the end of my wrists and the basis of my hands. Holding my phone is painful.
Sometimes, an intense weakness gains my fingers, to the point I can barely type on my phone.

I struggle to get up to get something to drink, to pee, I need to sit down on the floor every three meters because I feel too weak.

On the day that follows the pains, my belly looks completely different than it usually does. I don't tense up anything, but the ""side abs"" are hollow, making my waist appear much thinner (I mean... having a history of eating disorder, it's fucking me up in all kinds of ways to see it like that briefly)

My family doctor gave me Tramadol (Tramal is the brand name I believe - an opioid) but it doesn't stop the pain at all, it just makes me so incredibly high that I care less. It still hurts but I'm not really there. He also tried muscle relaxers, and it has absolutely no effect.

Has any of you lived through that ? Do you have any idea of things that could help ? I feel so alone 

Thank you for the time you took out of your day to read this, I really appreciate it

Sorry this is not autism related specifically if it ends up deleted that's fine there is a good chance I'm gonna delete this later anyone once I've calmed down.

I talked to my bf and mom or I tried to but it didn't help because they were reassuring me telling me I'm not stupid and everybody makes mistakes but the thing is I feel really really really really really stupid and it was totally my fault.

2025-08-14 04:55:32;How high is the possibility?;"Hello everyone, I suspect most people here don't like seeing this type of posts, but I'm feeling a very embarrassing kind of desperation for validation, and perhaps there are people who can relate to that feeling. Unfortunately, I currently live in a country that is not very educated on ASD, and especially for me as a 15F that suspects low support needs autism, it would be especially hard to get any recognition. As for my parents, they're the kind that don't believe in mental disorders or disabilities in their own children. And their knowledge on ASD is very limited as well due to the fact that the only autistic person they know is my male cousin who suffers from high support needs autism and is nonverbal. I am now going to list some of the things that make me suspect autism:

((In childhood))

• Need for predictability, going as far as wanting to control my environment and the people surrounding me

• Having 'meltdowns' when things wouldn't go my way (e.g, hiding away in corners and crying over specific things)

• Touch sensitivity — especially when it came to skin-to-skin contact

• Texture sensitivity in food — refusing any food that I wasn't familiar with, therefore developing an unhealthy diet that lead to me being underweight

• (Depending on memory) Kind of blunt way of speaking and not controlling what I said, HAVE gotten in trouble for doing so in the past

• Sometimes just inappropriate in social situations, especially while trying to make friends

• Used to be ridiculously oblivious to things people were saying or doing, which, I suppose is also called social cues

• Issues with change, leading to extreme burnout when I changed schools that clearly affected my former 'Straight A student and gifted' reputation

• Having the 'hoarder mindset', especially with things I collected (stuffed animals)

• Honestly just feeling really alien compared to others, I never had any 'real' friends until 7th grade

• Copying the way others act and speak

• And lastly, a fact that I'm not sure whether it's a symptom, but when describing me as a toddler/young child, my parents ALWAYS point out the fact that I used to be painfully hyperactive. Not sure whether that’s relevant

  
(Current life)

  
• Immense social anxiety, I basically can't work or navigate in social situations, which is why I worry that I won't have an independent future

• Another aspect that further increases my worries is the fact that I need really specific and dumbed down instructions to work socially, which I am sometimes too afraid to ask for

• Remaining and increased touch/texture sensitivity + diagnosed loudness hyperacusis 

• Safe food that I probably wouldn’t survive without

• Still ongoing, horrible relationship with change

• Stimming

• Need for predictability, routines (that I used to call 'traditions' until I informed myself on ASD) and need for control of my environment

• I was really told that I look unapproachable from the outside which is why my classmates tend to avoid me

• Being compared to a robot by friends and my father

• I feel very intensely, which is something I also read about in this subreddit. Happiness, for example, physically feels like adrenaline (idk how to explain)

• Six-year long interest in inazuma eleven (and general, huge interest in science and philosophy, with specific topics I especially love)

  
Basically, that's all I can spontaneously think of. The thing that is giving me impostor syndrome is the fact that I don't have any serious struggles with understanding social cues anymore. I can read emotions and body language, in fact, I think of it as a side hobby of mine, as I like observing and analyzing people and trying to predict their thoughts and behavior. I do take some idioms literally, but I don't struggle with irony or sarcasm. I've been told that I'm sarcastic myself. But that's basically everything that’s been bothering me and I just needed to get this off my chest.";;;;
2025-08-14 00:31:55;Extreme and confusing honesty from autistic partner - should I walk away?;"Hope it is okay for me (NT female in late 30s) to ask advice. I am dating a neurodivergent man in his late 30s who has never pursued a formal diagnosis but has a lot of the classical traits. 

We were housemates many years ago and had a ill fated brief relationship back then and reconnected last year after I came out of a long term relationship. Initially, we had agreed to be FWB at my suggestion as I thought it would be a good way of feeling ready to approach that side of myself again out with of my prior relationship. I have gained a lot of weight in the 8 years since we last dated and I knew this was something he had commented on and found unattractive but given it was meant to be a casual thing I think we both just went for it. 

Perhaps predictably, I started to get emotionally attached and earlier this year told him I was either happy to be friends or try for a relationship but not something in between. He agreed to give being together a shot and it's actually been a fairly happy 6 months. 

This weekend we were talking about people's attractiveness and he kinda blurted out a lot of stuff about how he sees me which was pretty horrible. He said he has found it hard to look at me at times, and finds it difficult to be seen in public with me. I have been trying to lose weight during this time with modest success. Despite all of this, he doesn't want to break up. And says over time he has found he cares less about how I look. I don't know what to do. Should I be with someone who is so unattracted to me? ";;;;
2025-08-13 21:48:53;Are those things part of autism?;"Hello! 15F unofficially diagnosed with high functioning autism (neuropsychologist and psychologist agree on the fact that I’m autistic, only got one assessment)

I dealt with strong impostor syndrome due to the fact that I am not officially diagnosed, and I kept questioning if I didnt accidentally fake my symptoms.

I decided to back away from really focusing on what symptoms are exactly written on websites when I search, and focused on my own weird behaviors of particularities, here’s what I noticed.

* When I have to meet new people, it makes me really stressed.
* Before talking to someone, I usually watch them interact with people I already know to get to know more about their personality and the way they act, so that I avoid saying or doing something that could seem weird. I adapt myself with every person I talk to.
* I can hardly stare at the face of new people, and can’t keep eye contact with people I know but arent “close” friends or family (like teachers, friends I dont really know well,…)
* I LOVE organizing stuff. I have problems cleaning my room, but when it comes to sorting things…. I LOVE IT. At times I randomly empty my bookshelf to sort it again, by colours, authors, or by how many books are in the collection.
* I think It is noise sensitivity, at least thats what I always considered it as but : When theres a really loud noise, I tend not to show to much annoyance (well, the loud noise could make me answer in a kind of annoyed/angered way if someone tries speaking to me, it can make me tear up, or I tend to bite my lip), but like in my head it’s like I can’t really think anymore, or at least I can’t control my thoughts, my brain seems to focus on the loud noise and I seem to lose control kind of? At times my body also tenses up or I cover my ears.
* If I can feel my clothes touch me in an uncomfortable way (especially when it comes to socks), I tend to feel extremely annoyed and feel like I wanna cry or scream.
* Clothes texture matters a lot to me : I dont care if I have to wear red pants with a blue shirt (which would apparently look bad), as long as it makes me comfortable then I’m good. And when it comes to socks I currently have one specific brand that I use all the time because my other socks are to tight, or the fabric is just…. Not good.

Thats about all.";;;;
2025-08-13 13:30:06;What to do if you disagree with a psychiatrist's diagnosis?;"Just had to suddenly switch psychiatrists because my last one stopped taking my insurance. My new psych is saying he thinks I might have Borderline Personality Disorder and that often times women get misdiagnosed with ADHD and Autism when it's really BPD the whole time. 

Tbh I really don't know if this diagnosis resonates with me at all. I'm reading about it and I feel like I barely have any of the symptoms. The ones that do match are things like very strong emotions and anxious attachment but that's basically it. I don't really engage in risky behavior, I don't have any anger issues, I don't self harm, I'm in a really stable relationship now and my last one lasted almost 4 years... 

The thing is I have no experience disagreeing with my doctor's diagnoses. I'm not resistant to having stigmatized diagnoses, I have autism and tourette syndrome and fully accepted that (though of course there were some emotions in receiving them).

What do I do, do I tell him I don't really agree with him? Do I just find a different psychiatrist? How do I phrase my disagreement without coming across as a ""problem patient""?";;;;
2025-08-12 02:09:25;Should I pursue a diagnosis?;"Hi, sorry to be a bother but I think I need a sounding board. So my therapist recently suggested I might be autistic, and I was completely shocked. After doing some research a lot of things started making sense. I suspect I have Asperger’s/level 1 ASD, but it’s so hard to know for sure because while a LOT of things fit, there are some that aren’t as clear or that I don’t struggle with as much as other things. 

I was able to get an assessment appointment scheduled and I was really excited about it at first, but now I’m feeling kind of overwhelmed and unsure. After reading about some of your experiences trying to get diagnosed and how strict the DSM-5 criteria is, I’m concerned that I might be too high functioning to warrant a clinical diagnosis. 

I’m worried they’ll tell me I don’t have anything wrong with me and then I’ll know I’m just weird. I feel like I’ll have to return all the stim toys I got and quit using the coping mechanisms I’ve been trying out because I won’t “qualify” to use them to feel better. I feel like I really need external validation to “allow” myself to feel better but if I don’t get it I’ll be worse off than before. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it’s worth it to go ahead with the assessment? Sorry this is so long. ";;;;
2025-08-11 21:20:42;Excessive tactile stimming causing pain;"Hi all. Sorry for the long post. I got a diagnosis of Global Developmental Delay at 32 so not autistic per se but I desperately need help with a tactile stim that's causing bad muscle skeletal pain from repetitive movement. 


I like to feel my hair strands individually. When I feel my hair I'm looking for a strand that's more course and bumpier than the rest of my hair. It's SO stimulating to touch them, but then I pull them out because it's 'wrong' to have a different texture other than smooth on my head. Then I start doing it again to find another bumpy strand, rinse and repeat. All day long. I started doing this when a classmate made fun of my frizzy hair when I was 15 so I had to feel my hair to get rid of the bumpy strands, until it started feeling so good and I haven't been able to stop. It takes up so much of my time and now I got recurrent shoulder pain from it.


I have a therapist and I don't think she believes it's as bad as I make it out to be because I don't do it in front of her. She told me to practice mindfulness, do yoga and listen to binaural beats. It's not working. What on earth can I do to decrease the frequency of this behavior?";;;;
2025-08-11 15:13:10;Do you have Autism with learning disabilities or just autism;"I want to ask for your advice! Is there any person with autism and learning difficulties? I would like to listen to your experiences. 

I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with autism, but I’ve been reading a lot on reddit about learning disabilities, and I wonder if I also have those with my autism.

⸻


Main Difficulties
	1.	🧭 Orientation issues
	•	I’m seriously disoriented — I can’t tell left from right and I get very lost in familiar environments.

	2.	🏀 Poor sports skills
	•	I’m very bad at sports. I’ve always been bad at every ball game, and I’ve always been low in athletics.
	•	Fortunately, I’m not bad at balance or aiming (like shooting or darts), but I’m bad at most sports.

	3.	➗ Math struggles
	•	I am very weak in math and reading graphs, tables, shapes, etc.
	•	I was terrible at math until middle school, and I even cried studying because I didn’t understand polynomials.
	•	In high school, I improved my math grades in a bloody effort to get into college, but it was incredibly difficult.

	4.	🗺️ Low spatial perception
	•	I’m very disorganized and don’t know how to use space effectively.
	•	I was also very bad at geography.

	5.	📐 3D thinking difficulties
	•	It’s hard to think three-dimensional images or shapes in my head, so I’m not good at utilizing space.
	•	I lack a sense of distance and have a hard time understanding instruction manuals without pictures.

	6.	✋ Poor manual dexterity
	•	I’m very bad at anything that requires manual dexterity — making things, crafts, etc.
	•	I can’t draw very well.
	•	I can tie my shoelaces or bows, but they aren’t neat and look clunky.

	7.	📖 Reading difficulties
	•	I don’t read texts well with my eyes.
	•	I can read, but it’s not smooth — I have to read like a picture, phrase by phrase.
	•	I’m a little better if I read out loud.
	•	I struggled with college exams that required a lot of reading comprehension.

	8.	🧩 Low comprehension skills
	•	I have low overall comprehension skills, which I struggled with in school.
	•	I compensate by memorizing well.
	•	I’m not good at reasoning, logical thinking, or structured thinking.
	•	I can’t imagine doing coding or being a lawyer.
	•	I’m a right-brained person, so I’m not good at pattern recognition (common among some autistic people).

⸻

Context
	•	On the surface, I had good grades, an IQ of 116, and got into one of the top universities in my country.
	•	People overlook my struggles because of this.
	•	I overcame them through extremely hard work, but the struggles are still there.
	•	I’ve been suffering from autism burnout for 6 years now.

Question

What are your experiences? 

I think I might have a learning disorder and wanted to hear the experiences of those that do have learning disorders (nvld, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, etc.) and autism. Along with wanting to hear from those who have just autism and learning difficulties from that. Can you please tell me your experiences?";;;;
2025-08-11 12:20:15;You don’t need an autism diagnosis to know you’re autistic;"When people post on Reddit wondering aloud if they might be autistic, I often see replies that amount to nothing more than “go see a clinician.” That’s reasonable advice on the surface, but why are so many people unwilling to engage with the topic itself?

I’m not suggesting we dismiss the value of trained professionals or the diagnostic process. But we also have the ability to understand what autism is, what it looks like, and what it feels like. Psychologists don’t have a monopoly on that knowledge.

In fact, you inherently hold a kind of information no clinician can fully access: your own internal experience. The irony is that even if you completely defer to a professional’s expertise, they still have to take your word for what that experience is like.

As a society, we’re only now starting to make real strides in understanding what autism is (and isn’t), how it presents, and how it feels from the inside. A lot has changed in just the last decade. One of the most important shifts has been learning to value (and believe) people’s own accounts of their internal experience.

Mainstream psychology is increasingly on board with self-identification. That means you do not necessarily need a formal diagnosis to consider yourself autistic or to tell others, such as a therapist, that you’re autistic.

So rather than shutting people down with “just get diagnosed,” why not engage in good faith with their questions? If you don’t know enough about autism to weigh in, it’s okay to simply not reply.

The sad reality is that many clinicians are behind the curve in their understanding, often due to outdated training, limited exposure to diverse presentations, or reliance on old diagnostic tools. Estimates suggest only about 30-40% are up to date on the most recent research and literature. Automatically deferring someone to a clinician is asking them to roll the dice, unless they happen to know of a truly informed resource.

The point of diagnosis is to guide treatment and support. If identifying as autistic helps you, through self-understanding, community connection, or practical changes, then it's already serving the same purpose. We should be more concerned with helping people thrive than with gatekeeping labels.";;;;

Tuesday, Aug 12, 12-1 pm Eastern US time";"AWG is a weekly Zoom meeting designed to reduce sensory, social, and executive burdens. Since 2021, we have been gathering to share our personal experiences on a weekly topic. This week, it's ""Our experiences of autism, sexual abuse, and coercion"".

Please join us!

Visit r/autisticwomensgroup to find the weekly Zoom meeting link and the link to the official website.

This meeting is for late-identified women and all other members of marginalized genders (mtf and ftm trans, nonbinary, autigender, and more.) We are clinically diagnosed, self-diagnosed, and questioning. Disclosure of diagnosis status/gender identity is the personal choice of each member and never required for full participation.

No registration is necessary. Mic and camera are never required. We have many members who come just to listen. We all participate in the way that is sustainable for us, *as we are today.*

Our topic share questions this week:

* No abuse victim or survivor is at fault for their own abuse. But do you ever think/wonder whether being autistic might have made you more vulnerable to it happening? How?
* If you have experienced sexual abuse or coercion, do you think the way you experienced/processed those events was/is determined at least in part by autism? If so, how?
* If the abuse took place before you learned you are autistic, has your understanding of events changed now that you know?
* If, now that you know you are autistic, you could tell yourself anything before and/or after the abuse occurred, what would you say?
* Any tools, resources, or strategies that helped you?
* Anything else to share?";;;;
2025-08-10 22:56:39;could i be on the spectrum?;"so i‘m currently considering to get tested for autism. i’ve suspected that i could be on the spectrum for about 2-3 years now and i’ve done a lot of research. what eventually always stopped me from pursuing to get a diagnosis is my friends telling be that i couldn’t possibly be autistic. this time around it’s different tho i’ve learned a lot about the concept of masking and that’s when it finally clicked. 
where i live getting a diagnosis is very expensive and insurance only covers a small portion of the cost so i guess i would want to know whether people on here think it’s warranted for me to get tested.

here are the symptoms i resonate with:

-i’ve always stimmed by touching/massaging my ears especially my right ear for as long as i can remember i’ve done this to self soothe and i still find myself doing it daily i definitely stim in other ways too like repeating phrases, rubbing my feet or fingers together or picking my skin, i also smoke cigarettes mainly in social settings which i guess could count as a stim as well?

-i‘m very sensitive to noise and lights. i’ve had to leave social settings bc it was simply too light or the lights were to bright. if i didn’t allow myself to get away from the situation i would experience a panic attack. i always wear headphones outside and sunglasses too. i find it hard to speak if there are noises like a tv in the background (i’ve only recognize this when i‘m at home with my parents in other situations i tend to handle it which i guess would be masking too?)

-i have other diagnoses, to be precise anorexia, ocd, general anxiety and for some time it was suspected that i was bipolar 

-i started talking early and i’ve always been very well spoken, which means i’ve always talked very maturely for my age and i’ve always used „grown up phrases“, also i’ve always talked a lot and i still do when i feel safe enough to be myself and when it’s about a topic that i‘m interested in. i’ve been asked multiple times by people i was just meeting for the first time where i‘m from bc of my accent. accent basically just means that i talk very correctly when i don’t know someone and not in a slight dialect as i tend to do a little when i feel safe.

-i realized that whenever i had a crush on someone in recent years it was bc they let me talk uninterruptedly about my interests and always seemed so very interested in what i had to say, i hate to admit it but more times than not i was not interested as much in what they had to say

-the one person that i can talk freely to currently is my mother even though i know it’s exhausting for her, but i have this strong need to say things out loud in order to feel more organized. my mother in the past also told me that i have hourlong monologues without even realizing it and that i talk in a lecturing way, i’ve also heard her say my tone is rude whenever i feel misunderstood and try to explain myself, also she has complained that i don’t seem to be interested in what she has to say (which sometimes is true and i feel horrible about it) 

-i have clear memories of feeling that im misunderstood all the time (disclaimer: i have experienced trauma which wasn’t talked about until i brought it up at 19) and that i would make it my goal to get my point across no matter what which has lead to me being a rly good communicator but also to me overexplaining myself 

-i’ve always had friends but i’ve never initiated any of those friendships until i was 12 or 13 where i „had no other choice“ i have clear memories of thinking it’s up to me to decide to either fit in or to be an outsider in school and ever since then i made it my mission to fit in for some time i had the image of being very superficial since it was all i cared and focused about. since i can remember i have always been a perfectionist and a people pleaser 

-the reason i felt the need to make friends was that i had a best friend who moved across the globe when i was 11 and we were inseparable before she left we wouldn’t attend school if the other one was not going and we even tried to convince ppl we were twins we would not talk to anyone except each other, now in hindsight she always showed some obvious signs of being neurodivergent and her father is a diagnosed autistic (we‘re still friends and she only found this out years ago)

-even though i’ve always felt different i never attributed that to maybe being on the spectrum i’ve never felt like an alien just like not being girly enough not fitting in with my peers/girls my age. i always thought i felt different bc i had experienced trauma pretty early on and i thought i must be the only one 

-i’ve always watched children my age and i have several memories of actively memorizing how girls my age acted it almost felt like real acting to me as a child when i would copy them. my mother has told me that as a small child i would go up to slides just to observe other children on the playground and only when somebody came up to go down the slide i realized i needed to go down the slide as well 

-to add to the point of not feeling like an alien: i do take things very literally and how would i know how an alien feels? if there are phrases that i know i also know whether they’re meant literally or not but in spontaneous situations i struggle. i also tend to over interpret instructions. i can be sarcastic and i can make jokes and i can sometimes be very sure that they’ll „land“ but other times no body reacts to what i thought would be funny

-now to socializing in general: i guess why it never occurred to me that i might be autistic is bc i never questioned my masking it has always been a way for me to survive especially when my best friend left when i was 11/12. but in recent years i’ve noticed that i can’t to what i used to, i get exhausted from meeting people especially people i don’t know and group settings with people i don’t know. eventually i managed to find a group of friends in school btw. i have a group of friends now who i’ve encountered through a shared flat some years ago i rly appreciate them and i don’t mask as much around them they just think i‘m quirky or to quote on of my friends „neurotic“ but i do feel like they appreciate me too. i rarely initiate meeting up, im aware of this and i have voiced to them that i‘m aware and that i appreciate them reaching out. i just don’t think about it that way i enjoy doing things alone despite sometimes feeling lonely. i tend to get more out of an experience when i do them alone. overall im pretty good at masking i have „prepared“ topics for small talk with strangers, i know when to shut up and when to speak (for the most part) i can look people in the eyes even though i rarely do it intuitively bc i tend to stare until i realize i stare and then i look away. whenever strangers talk about my interests i light up and talk about it with them (which is way less draining than talking about something else) but i often question whether i should say something or not while the conversation continues and sometimes i think of phrases/topics that i could bring up later in the conversation. i’ve always prided myself with picking up emotions from the people around me but i noticed that i always judge others emotions based on how i would feel. i often felt like people don’t like me or were mad at me without ever truly knowing if that was the case. i also get frustrated when someone doesn’t adhere to social rules that i have accepted and that i make an effort to keep up.

-i tend to pick up phrases and use them continuously for weeks 

-almost everything i do has a specific routine which i didn’t even notice for the longest time 


things i do not resonate with:

-i do not have much issues with textures whether it be food or clothing even though i would never wear something scratchy or too tight if i do and go into a social setting my chances of having a panic attack increase

-i do not have the „classic“ struggles with social interactions and i do not rly fear them bc i know how good i can be at socializing even though it’s draining. meeting new people one on one and even sometimes groups has recently lead to me having panic attacks tho

-i‘m not sure if i experience delayed processing to some extent i would say yes but it’s not super apparent to me i just know that i’ve actively tried to be in the present more lately and enjoy the current moment.

-i have special interests which are very „normal“ and i get defensive over them (which idk if that’s something that is related to autism) but i don’t go suuuuper deep into them or at least i never manage to do so for a long periods of time i tend to switch between them even though i have some core interests that never change 

all this has only become apparent to me in the last years as i said which has lead to me looking into it more. specifically it’s the exhaustion that i feel all the time and the search for people who don’t always talk about surface topics that has also made me curious.

i’m really thankful if you’re even still reading this and i would love to know your thoughts bc i really want to get tested but it’s very expensive and my therapist for example thinks i‘m only highly sensitive (but also she’s not specialized in the field of neurodivergence). sometimes i think i‘m just biased bc i do so much research on the topic and that maybe i‘m just pretending. since i started looking into it i also seem to notice more of my behaviors idk it’s all very confusing.

2025-08-10 21:32:36;Diagnosis and feeling like a fraud;"Hi!

I love this sub - I’ve posted a few times here recently but I’ve only this week been diagnosed with level 1 autism and I’m in a bit of a mental whirlwind right now trying to figure it all out. Ive had excellent advice on here before so hopefully you can help again. 

I’m really trying to get past a strong sense of imposter syndrome. I was so sure before my assessment that I was not autistic that even reading the psychiatrists report I’m questioning whether I was even telling the truth or if I’m exaggerating things. During the assessment I told myself again and again to be myself and not force anything in case I’m too good at masking something and they miss something. As a result I couldn’t help being overly aware of eye contact and ended up losing focus and missing some of the conversation. 

I keep looking over my assessment report (I must have read it 4 times over 2 days) and I realise all the points are true and I wasn’t lying but I never had associated them with asd before and just feel like the psychiatrists are exaggerating my struggles? It’s a really hard feeling to put into words, but I feel like I don’t deserve this diagnosis, and probably from longstanding misunderstandings of what autism actually is. I’ve researched it almost all day for last 6 weeks and read Unmasking Autism twice in that time so have wildly changed my perception of it, but still struggle to identify it actually as me, despite there being evidence from childhood.

Do you have any practical advice for beginning to accept a diagnosis and getting past this feeling? I’ve also been diagnosed with adhd in the last few weeks so that’s another one I’m coming to terms with. I have no immediate family or friends who are neurodivergent so no contacts to talk it through with and my partner is a little clueless right now. ";;;;
2025-08-10 21:03:44;Is it getting worse as I get older or am I just imagining this? 42m;"I'm going to preface this by saying that as I look back over my life, in hindsight I can see the same things that I'm experiencing now also happening then. I don't think that I suddenly developed symptoms of autism later in life, they've been there all along and I'm only really noticing them in the last 5 years after I was encouraged to consider that I'm on the spectrum and should get a diagnosis.

But I'm curious to ask how other people think they've changed as they got older because more and more often I feel like the older I get the More difficult it becomes to mask, ignore, or just find ways to work around my symptoms. 

I'll give you an example what I mean. I've often experienced increased difficulty speaking when I'm tired or stressed out, but it was never so bad that it seemed unusual to me. This happens to everybody right? 

But over the last 18 months, it's happened that I feel like I have less and less tolerance for sensory overload, specifically with overlapping noise. It doesn't even have to be very loud, just competing noises. If I recognize in time that I'm experiencing sensory overload than I can usually catch it before it gets too bad but over the last 18 months there have been several instances where It got so bad that I couldn't even speak.

This has never happened to me so severely before. It's like I'm on the verge of a complete mental/emotional breakdown and My words are stuck like pressure in my throat and I can't get them out. Last week I had to resort to using my hands to explain that I needed to leave the room to walk for a minute because I couldn't get the words out.

It's really frustrating and embarrassing. I've never experienced such severe speech loss as I have in the last 18 months. There's always been issues with sensory overload when it comes to noise, and in the past my coping strategy was basically that I didn't recognize it was happening and I just powered through it with a terrible temper and not understanding why I was so upset. 

But I'm asking about this because it feels like the more I recognize what causes problems for me and try to modify my surroundings, or better adapt myself to my surroundings, The more it happens. I don't ever remember having so much difficulty managing myself in the past as I do today. Does anybody else have this problem?";;;;
2025-08-10 13:58:23;High vs low support needs;"Hi everyone,

I am in the process of getting a later in life diagnosis.  Recently I have been struggling with burnout and have needed a lot more support.

I noticed in some autism groups that high support needs caregivers and parents dismiss lower support needs autistics within the community.  

I am curious if anyone has some context around that. I don’t see people that are paralyzed dismissing paraplegics because they are quadriplegic just because they can move their arms.  I’m not sure I understand how level 1 autistics are not autistic enough to be autistic like level 3’s.

It makes me nervous that if I ever need a higher level of support, it won’t be there or I could be dismissed. ";;;;
2025-08-08 23:04:53;falling asleep;"Hey all, 

Just wondered if anyone has experienced falling asleep as a stress response. I can only really find articles about how being overstimulated might mean people with ASD might struggle to sleep, but if I get too stressed I literally get sleepy. Throughout high school and university I would fall asleep - sometimes exactly where I was sat. I remember sitting on the floor and playing e-piano in uni and then waking up laid next to it.

I don't think it's narcolepsy as it's been a while since I felt this way - it was usually in highly stressful situations such as assignments, creative writing etc. Now I will have a stress nap after a busy day intentionally.

  
Just wondered if anyone has any similar experiences. I got diagnosed this morning.";;;;
2025-08-08 19:35:58;What level 1 autism looks like for you?;"I am not diagnosed, but I suspect I might be autistic. I’ve taken a lot of tests online, and all of the results showed a high likelihood of that. I told my therapist, and she said there’s a strong chance I might be right. She will talk to one of her colleagues who specializes in this field.

Now I feel really bad, because what if I just made it up? What if I was lying? I didn’t mean to, but… I’m so confused right now, because I expected her to say something like, “These tests are not valid, and you don’t have all the symptoms anyway, so don’t overthink this.” But I’m overthinking really badly, lol.

I think I got scared because she took it so seriously. I thought I was just exaggerating... I’ve seen a lot of videos on TikTok about what it’s like being autistic, and I can relate to some of them. But I feel like I’m not “autistic enough” to be really autistic - if that makes sense.

So, could you tell me what level 1 autism looks like for you? Do you sometimes feel that you’re not autistic enough despite your diagnosis? Do you have all of the symptoms?";;;;
2025-08-08 14:55:16;I don't know how to go on with inquiring about a diagnosis;"Throwaway account.

Hi, I'm looking for some sort of advice about how to ask for a diagnosis because I don't have a clue about how to start.

For some background, I am AFAB and I think I could possibly be a low support, masking autistic with symptoms on the more mild end. I say this because I don't suffer majorly from most of the typical autistic traits like sensory issues or social cues. Like for example I am definitly not good with being social as a whole and I am not the most confident with my ability to pick up certain social cues. I can pick up the cue that somebody is inviting me to an event and I can clearly discern scam texts and bots, but I can often overlook problematic behavior in others. I do have difficulty trying to discern whether or not a symptom I have is an autistic trait or neurotypical.
Example: Lying. Sometimes I won't pick up a short white lie, like a friend telling me a piece of unharmful misinformation as a joke and I don't realize that I'm being lied to as a joke until they tell me, because I blindly believed what they said was plausible enough to be true. But at the same time, any neurotypical might believe a small white lie told to them like that. Most people are a little more inclined to believe plausible lies from their close friends or family because they trust them. It could be something linked to possible autism or just something normal and I genuinely cannot tell the difference.
But at the same time, I don't do anything like stimming and I feel like I'm more depressed rather than possibly having autistic burn out.

I am also on antidepressents because I have been diagnosed with depression, however it has been about eight weeks and I feel as if nothing has changed. At all. I don't know if it's because I'm on the wrong dosage, the wrong medication, or if it's another problem entirely. I could have autism or I could just have untreated depression or possibly ADHD and I just don't know because I haven't gotten a diagnosis.

My problem with getting a diagnosis is asking at all. I was at one point, no joke, outright told not to ""self-diagnose"". Ever since, I have been constantly telling myself to not self-diagnose because it's wrong and I'm wrong all the time. But the entire point of asking for a diagnosis is because you feel like something is wrong.
The best way to describe it is if I had severe abdominal pain and I went to the ER, I would push back the possibility of having appendicitis elsewhere in my mind because now I am thinking ""What if it is just my uterus?"" ""What if it's not actually that painful and I'm just a wimp?"" ""Is it actually appendicitis, or am I constipated?"" ""Well, I'm only in pain. Sources say I should have at least two other symptoms that I don't have so it can't be appendicitis.""
I don't want something to be ""wrong"" with me. I want some sort of explanation, and now I feel helpless in some sort of quest to get some sort of diagnosis so I can start actually living without any sort of problem. I would love to stop thinking I'm some sort of attention seeking fraud by being told yes or no by a professional so I stop hating myself. I don't know how to ask for help without thinking I'm looking for just some reason to say ""well I'm actually autistic and that's why this and that"" about something completely unrelated. I just want to be told yes or no so I can move on to figuring out what else it could be before it gets to be too much.

Sorry for the rant.
Does anybody have some advice about how to exactly ask for a diagnosis?";;;;
2025-08-08 05:23:06;Can I call myself autistic whilst getting diagnosed;For context, I am seeking a professional diagnosis, I also almost had one before the pandemic hit however because of that the doctor lost all of the paperwork due to the chaos of everything and it's been a nightmare to get everything set up again as I am almost an adult. I've heard some people say that it's not valid because if I was really autistic then I would've been diagnosed sooner and others say that it's fine because I am seeking a professional diagnosis. For extra context, both of my younger siblings are also autistic so it runs in the family and some of my old teachers, including the SEN teacher, and my mum and other autistic friends have all said that I have a lot of traits. I'm just questioning whether I'm allowed to acknowledge that I have those traits and am allowed to seek out a diagnosis due to the discourse around older people getting diagnosed because people have said that I'm not allowed to say that I THINK I'm autistic because I haven't been diagnosed yet. Like I get that it seems odd to some people that I'm 17 and am still figuring this out but I masked well until I was like 14 and one of my teachers noticed and talked to me & my mum but a lot of people have said that's not valid. I don't want to seen like I'm self diagnosing either because I know about that discourse as well but after doing a lot of research amd comparing it to both of my siblings and friends traits, I do think I'm autistic. My mum figured it out with my little sister because she acts a lot like I do and she has an official diagnosis which had just further proved it to me;;;;
2025-08-07 04:11:00;Being NVLD + Highly Sensitive Person - actually different, or just a different way of saying Autistic?;"I posted here a while back to ask if my list of symptoms looked like autism, or maybe another disorder. Which, first of all, thank you for the encouraging response! I ended up getting an assessment, and the result was that the psychologist believes I am not autistic, but a Highly Sensitive Person with Non-Verbal Learning Disorder. But in what I've read about NVLD so far (hadn't heard of it before being diagnosed), it's still controversial whether it's truly separate from autism. And I've not looked too deeply into it, but I always thought ""Highly Sensitive Person"" was just a wishy washy way of saying someone is level 1 autistic, or has sub-clinical traits.

I know real life brains are more complicated than the groups people have created to put them into, so there isn't always a clear cut answer about what box a person belongs in (although I'm sure a lot of us here would like there to be lol). But I was just wondering what the community thinks about it?

From what I understand social problems can present very similarly in NVLD and ASD, but the difference is the source issue. NVLD affects a person's ability to process visual/spacial and non-literal information, so you miss social cues or process them too slowly to respond properly in conversation. ASD affects a person's ability to process specifically social information, so you might see social cues but not be able to understand their meaning. A NVLD person could look at a facial expression and intuitively understand its meaning, but simply not process it in actual interactions because their focus is elsewhere, and likely more attuned to verbal information. An ASD person would look at a facial expression and not know the meaning unless it is explained to them, and then they could use that information to respond appropriately in real interactions (although it could still be challenging, and takes a lot of energy).

But, is this an accurate understanding of how autistic people process? Isn't it also theorized that the reason autistic people miss nonverbal cues is due to their brains non having an information filter, and therefore they are overwhelmed and unable to process all the info at once? Or that bottom up processing causes them to see individual details, missing how it adds up to a social meaning? Some experts also think that what we currently know as ASD is actually several different disorders with similar presentation, so is NVLD just one of those disorders that we've been able to identify?

Also, I do agree with the NVLD diagnosis for myself because it's supported by a 20 point gap between my verbal and non-verbal IQ scores, and I experience a lot of the visual/spacial symptoms unrelated to autism like having no sense of direction, trouble rotating objects in my head, trouble with depth perception like when catching a ball or merging lanes while driving, great route memory and reading ability but poor spelling and math skills, poor spacial awareness in general, etc. I also don't relate to being able to recognize patterns quickly and easily like is common with autism, and I do intuitively understand facial expressions and tone of voice as far as I can tell, I just often don't know how to respond to people and may take longer to understand why people feel the way they do.

Some of the reasons the psychologist gave for not making an autism diagnosis in addition to NVLD were engaging in imaginative role play with others as a child, understanding other's perspectives, understanding and using humor, not having strict routines, and not having many repetitive patterns. I can accept all that, and an outside perspective on whether I meet the criteria for RRB's was a big part of the reason I wanted to talk to a professional. However, she also acknowledged that I don't usually initiate or intuitively understand how to reciprocate in conversation, have trouble understanding and processing my emotions, experience verbal shutdown, struggle with change, have some sensory sensitivities, and use sensory stimulation to self-soothe.

So it sounds like to me that I meet all three social criteria and possibly 2 or 3 out of 4 RRB's (stimming, sameness, sensory sensitivities), but because NVLD can explain the social symptoms and the preference for sameness, I no longer meet the criteria? But NVLD doesn't include sensory differences, so that is explained by saying I'm simply Sensitive.

To be clear, I honestly think the psychologist I saw was very knowledgeable and empathetic, and she repeatedly said she believes autism is just a different way of being, and most of autistic people's struggles stem from societal nonacceptance. I don't think she was dismissing me based on me being an adult woman who can communicate well or anything. She even said if that I know myself better than she does, and if I'd like to discuss any questions I still have about autism further we can do that. I guess the idea of NVLD is just still very new, and feels a lot more complicated to get people to understand than just saying I'm autistic when how it presents is so similar.

Edit: Sorry for confusion, HSP was not an official diagnosis. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NVLD) was a diagnosis.";;;;
2025-08-07 00:39:09;Gag reflex/texture aversion ruining my life;"I (34m) have a major gagging problem when it comes to multiple parts of my life.

First of all, I gag every time I brush my teeth. I am basically incapable of brushing my back teeth because I WILL gag every single time, and I even gag most of the time just trying to brush my front teeth, I can only do it for like 5 seconds at a time before I start to feel my gag reflex coming. I do notice it is worse in the morning, and especially if I didn't sleep well, and I have better success in the evening, but it still happens. It also causes issues at the dentist, where I cannot keep my mouth open for more than a few seconds before starting to gag, making it basically impossible for me to get any work done in my mouth (I avoided the dentist for 10 years because of this).

It also causes major issues for food. I think it mostly has to do with texture, where I refuse to eat certain foods I know have a certain texture or if they are foods I am unfamiliar with, which is really embarrassing because I have a lot of friends from other cultures and I basically cannot eat their food because I get so anxious before eating it that it is almost guaranteed to make me gag. Also if I bite into something and it has a slightly unexpected texture, even if it is something I have eaten many times, it can make me gag and I need to spit it out.

I do think it is a mix of Anxiety (Diagnosed, working on treatment) and Autism (Not diagnosed).

Has anyone had ANY luck getting over these hurdles?";;;;
2025-08-06 08:15:30;Could I be assessed for autism in a mental hospital?;I'm 17 and going into my senior year, I think I display a fair amount of autistic traits but my therapist won't take me seriously, like won't even entertain the idea, and I can't get assessed because I need insurance to cover it, and even if I could it would probably be months. I am not planning to wind up in the hospital to get an assessment, that is a horrible idea. But I have struggled with self harm/suicidal ideation and all this frustration is making that bubble up. So if I hypothetically wound up in a psych ward for unrelated reasons, could I be diagnosed there? Again, I do not intend to wind up in the hospital, last time was a very damaging experience. This is a hypothetical, in case I wound up there for a real reason, to see if I could get one good thing out of it.;;;;
2025-08-06 03:56:41;Unmasking tips;"I’m a librarian and have summers off. This summer I went down the rabbit hole of autism for a research project I begin in the fall, as well as personal interest as I’ve always had autistic and adhd traits, have close family members with many more autism traits than I do so this was soon coming for me. 

Getting the costly diagnosis is not an option. I am comfortable where I am at with a self-actualization. 

I read some very compelling books including works by Devon Price and many memoirs. Fern Brady’s had to be the most compelling and relatable.
I’m at Midlife and feel like I never really knew my identity. I wonder what value unmasking will have for this aspect of my life- I am aware that unmasking may help reduce my anxiety and meltdowns as long as I become more aware of my triggers and find out what I need to accommodate for at work and in my relationships. I’m eager to find out if it helps me with my sense of self as I’ve always had esteem issues.

I’m curious to hear how others went about unmasking and how it went.";;;;
2025-08-06 03:46:33;anyone’s parents not pick up on autistic traits?;hi, i’m currently in the process of getting a diagnosis but while i’m asking my mum questions she’s saying no to things that i have experienced for as long as i can remember. i struggled to remember a lot of my early childhood so it’s hard to confirm but idk whether or not to trust what she’s saying because i think even now she doesn’t pay attention or see some things i struggle with/do.;;;;
2025-08-06 00:18:05;Resources for self-diagnosis? Also, a question on using the term neurodivergent.;"Hey y’all, I have two questions! For context, I’m a cis woman in my late twenties, and have never been diagnosed. For a while now, I have believed there is a chance I could be autistic. There are a number of reasons I believe this, but I won’t go into it here.

My first question: is it wrong/inappropriate that I sometimes use the word neurodivergent to describe myself, despite not actually knowing if I really am neurodivergent or autistic? I don’t usually bring it up, but people often assume that I am, and I find it simpler to just not correct them rather than explain my whole situation. Or sometimes, if I’m really struggling in a given situation or feel like I’m acting in a more noticeably “non-neurotypical” manner because of it, I’ll casually mention that I’m neurodivergent or “neurospicy” so that they’ll take me (and my needs) more seriously (because unfortunately I’ve found that people often don’t otherwise).

If it comes up as part of a longer conversation, I’m always honest about my situation and that I don’t have a diagnosis. I just find that in many cases it’s simpler and more comfortable for me to assume the label. If this is wrong, and you think I should stop doing it, what are some different way I can approach those types of situations?

My second question: those of you who have self-diagnosed, what resources did you use? How did you go about your research and making sure sources are reputable? As evidenced by my first question, I do feel a bit guilty about using the term without a diagnosis. I’m also not in a financial situation where I could easily procure an official one. I didn’t even know that self-diagnosis was an option before I found this sub, but it makes me feel a lot better that I have the chance to resolve this for myself. So any advice would be greatly appreciated!";;;;
2025-08-05 21:00:05;My family doesnt believe when im sick;"Since i was little my family (mostly parents) say im over exaggerating, that im being dramatic etc, because when i was little i used to feel a lot of belly pain and couldnt explain it, i would just say it was ""belly pain"". They took me to a dr who said i needed a liver transplant but luckily i went to another that said that i just had a tiny liver problem. Since then they dont believe me, i still get a lot of belly pain, anxiety, and low pressure. 
I had a 1cm stone in my kidney 2yrs ago and they didnt believe me until the doctors showed them the image of my kidneys
I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and it causes me to get more issues, guess who still doesnt believe me?
Since last year i had: burnouts, shoulder pain, a pilonidal cyst, gastrointestinal issues (frequent), anxiety attacks, pelvic floor issues, and more. 
They never believe me, im currently at the hospital, they didnt want to bring me and they always want me to stay at home and ""wait out"".  But i stayed at home yesterday and im not better, i don't want to stay a week at home. 
I had a colonoscopy last week and had to stay home during monday, my mom told me to stay in work for more time to make up for it
Im fucking sick of this and i just want to move, but sadly i dont want to live alone and i don't have enough money (but they want me to pay for everything, they think i use my money for fun) and im investing as much as possible to move as quickly as possible, i'm just waiting for my boyfriend to graduate and get a job
This was more of a way to share what i've been feeling and try to get some compassion, since at home i'm not getting any

2025-08-05 16:05:54;Autism presenting as OCD?;"Hi :3 I (17ftm) had my first psych eval last week, testing for ocd, depression, adhd, autism, and anxiety. I've suspected for about 3 years now that I'm autistic but have only recently been able to convince my mother to let me get screened for that and adhd. Pretty much already knew that I have severe depression and anxiety but was never diagnosed. OCD I brushed off as unlikely--my mom has it really bad, and she and I are opposites in many regards.

Well, talked to my psychologist today, and turns out that I have ""just below moderate"" OCD, clinical depression and anxiety, and I shit you not and I quote, ""too much personality"" to be autistic. He said that only some of my results came back indicative of autism, but that my pattern recognition was corresponding with that of a neurotypical person. The ""too much personality"" bit pmo so much too, mom said I'm overreacting and that he didn't mean anything by it but I'm not listening to her lol. I told him to his face that I was actively masking because I would rather be perceived as neurotypical to people I don't know, so it's not really fair to judge me on my behavior toward a stranger (I didn't say that last bit but I was kinda trying to imply that, didn't want to accidentally be rude). He also said that my eye contact was indicative of a neurotypical person; I told him it's a different story in person and that I really struggle with it in person; he responded with basically ""if you were REALLY autistic, it would be a universal thing you'd struggle with."" I had never met this psychologist before today. On the other hand, my therapist who I've been with for a year has said before that my behavior when I'm COMFORTABLE is indicative of autism. Not to mention I have a family history of it. My dad is dead but he had the trademark symptoms of low-support autism in amab people (according to my therapist). On my maternal side, I have a niece 15f with severe adhd, and a nephew 5m who has high-support autism, and we suspect my maternal grandpa 80m probably is, but he'll never get it checked out lol. 

This is just so frustrating bc this ocd diagnosis came out of NOWHERE. The psychologist said he's not taking the possibilities of autism and adhd off the table, but he's not putting them on the table either, and my mom said that's a good thing. I'm getting retested in six months and I'm terrified it's going to come back not indicative of autism. I don't really care too much about having or not having adhd, it's not as big of a deal. This is because I have really bad meltdowns pretty much regularly, more frequently ever since my dad died in Feb 2024 very suddenly, and I've had them for my entire life. Until I realized I was autistic, I just thought (and was told) that it was bc I was spoiled, immature, and didn't know how to deal with not getting my way. With realizing I was autistic, I have this safety net of ""I am the way I am bc of a disorder, and it's not a moral failing on my part; feeling like this is ok bc this is how my brain is supposed to be."" And now I'm terrified that's going to be taken away, that I won't feel okay with continuing to call myself autistic, that I'll feel guilty and like a terrible person who's faking it, and I'll be right back at square one. 

Anyways my point is... is this common in afab people, for autism to possibly get misdiagnosed as ocd? I'm not saying I DON'T have ocd esp w my rampant family history of it. (AT LEAST 4 generations in a row with it now, including me!) It just caught me VERY off guard because whatever flavor of ocd I have is VERY different from my mom's and grandma's lol. This is probably relevant but the psychologist in question is an old balding man. Sorry that this is long, tysm if you've read this far <3

TLDR: sudden diagnosis of ocd, old psychologist man told me I have ""too much personality"" to be autistic; can autism present as ocd in afab people?";;;;
2025-08-05 14:07:45;Feeling… a bit weird in taking medications;"I’m 28 ftnb and had a diagnosis since I was five.   My mom really didn’t believe in medicating me when I was a kid and honestly I’m grateful I grew up not get med shoved down my throat.

My mood and mental health, however, have been getting worse with age. My meltdowns, while I used to work through them, completely shut me down. Antidepressants don’t help fully and my emergency meds are a hit or miss. Seeing I am also a bipolar risk and how my psych said “there’s a lot of trauma on top of the autism”, I had genetic testing done to see what medications work for me. The big two suggested for Autism, Abilify and risperidone, are on the list that says “you can take them but you’ll get sick”. Psych gave me something new and I’m having no side effects.

I’m looking forward to having less irritability and more manageable meltdowns and shutdowns. I’m just feeling weird for being autistic and choosing to medicate. MMJ is not an option anymore since I work in public works. ";;;;
2025-08-05 10:21:19;Autism and writing fiction;"Hi I am not officially diagnosed but ive done research for years now and can confidently say I am level one without feeling like a fraud. But ive always struggled with understanding emotion and how others are feeling in a certain moment. I try to put myself in others shoes as a writer to feel what they feel but I have this anxiety that my interpretation of a moment may be wildly different from how a neurotypical would perceive a situation and worry my writing may not be good because of this. 

Any autistic creative writers in this forum that can give advice on how to handle emotional beats in stories and ensure that the way you explain things are relatable to a wide audience? ";;;;
2025-08-05 09:14:26;Got my autism diagnosis at 30… but my family left me on read.;"A few days ago, I received my evaluation results and was diagnosed with autism—at 30 years old.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety around the age of 10. Through my young adult years and up until two years ago, I was sure I was on the spectrum. I tried various medication combinations, had my vitals and thyroid tested, etc.—but nothing ever seemed to work. None of my doctors ever suggested a clinical psychology exam.

My sister has worked with children on the spectrum for over 10 years and always said I wasn’t autistic—I was just shy and anxious.

About a year ago, I found a new psychiatrist. She was the first person to suggest I get tested for ADHD, bipolar, PTSD, autism, etc. It took me about 10 months to finally follow through, but I’m so glad she kept encouraging me.

Now I just want to scream it from the rooftops—like, “I’M NOT WEIRD, I’M JUST DIFFERENT!!”
My family had asked me to keep them updated on the results. My mom was convinced I was only anxious and depressed.

Well, I told them… and they all left me on read.
I don’t know if I should call and ask, “Did you see my text?” Because I know they did—we have a family chat, and they’re actively talking in it. It even shows they read my message. I’m kind of heartbroken.

I feel so relieved, because for most of my life I’ve felt different and misunderstood. So many tears, so many emotional outbursts—only to be dismissed as “crazy,” “too anxious,” or “just seeking attention,” including by some of the therapists I saw when I was younger.

Is it weird that I want to tell the world?
Is it weird that I want to advocate almost immediately after my diagnosis?
What’s too much, too soon?

FWIW, my boyfriend and best friend have been incredibly supportive, and I’m so thankful for them. It just hurts the most when it’s your own family who dismisses you.

After 30 years of wondering what was “wrong” with me—I finally got my answer. I’m autistic. And honestly? I feel seen.

If anyone else has been diagnosed later in life, I’d love to hear your experience. It feels like I’m starting a new chapter, and I don’t know where to begin. All I know is that I’m relieved and happy. I’m anticipating that grief may come later as I reflect more deeply on my life.";;;;
2025-08-05 06:31:00;Can you be autistic if your parents have never expressed suspicions you might be?;"Over the last couple years I’ve been wondering if I might be autistic, so many symptoms line up and it explains a lot. Even my psychologist agrees I might have it (even though I feel like she’s just agreeing with my thoughts because she feels like she has to and I’m just forcing it but that’s a whole other can of worms). 

My parents have never said anything about this though. I feel like if I was really neurodiverse I would have been diagnosed already or at least thought to have autism. But my parents have never said anything about suspecting it, other then my dad who notes he is very much ‘like me’ when it comes to symptoms and my aunt (who was a nurse) suspected he has aspergers. 

There’s also my friends. I have multiple neurodiverse friends, a couple of which I have known since I was very little. And they’ve never said anything about it either. I asked them if they think I may have anything and they couldn’t really answer which I took as a no.

With all of this, could I still be autistic or am I just forcing it because no one other then my psychologist has ever expressed that I may have it?";;;;
2025-08-05 00:52:26;I think I might have high functioning autism (I know it's not called that anymore);"I think I might forgo the formal diagnosis. Not only am I adjusted enough to be okay, I'm also older, I can mask enough, and diagnosis is ridiculously expensive. I'd only want it for validation and maybe therapy to help me specifically for autism should I need it in the future. 

The problem I have with self diagnosis is that if I go on based on what others say and they are also self-diagnosed, they may be making what is a neurotypical thing seem like a neurodivergent thing and then you'll have loads of people thinking something typical is atypical, and that doesn't help anyone. What I do know is that when a neurotypical person tells me I'm strange or am doing something strange I thought was normal, such as swaying side to side or not looking at them in the eye when I speak (told by my boyfriend when I was 13 years old). I never paid attention if I did that before or not. I just can't concentrate when I'm looking into people's eyes when I speak. It's mostly okay when they speak to me. 

Any thoughts?

_______________________________


Additional thoughts:

The few traits I listed are not the only things affecting me. I could write a small book with all the symptoms that might be autism.

The fact that I’ve masked and learned to function doesn’t erase autism — it just means I’ve worked hard to survive in a world not built for me.

What I mean by ""I'm adjusted enough to be okay"" is that what I need to survive is there, but I'm not exactly thriving. I don't know all the social rules and I often get confused by jokes, sarcasm from people I don't know, and why most people don't like me.

I think I mask well enough most times, but if someone spends enough time with me, they think I'm strange and they tend to ignore me, talk over me, and exclude me.

I was fascinated with psychology when it was first introduced to me because I thought ""Maybe I can finally understand people."" I am still fascinated by it, but it hasn't helped me figure out how to socialize well enough to be liked. I have very few friends and have lost some due to not knowing that I was getting taken advantage of until years later or something I did very wrong to my friend.

I hope this explains my point better.";;;;
2025-08-05 00:18:31;Just venting about grief;"Sometimes I am struck by the most overwhelming waves of grief. Grieving that I spent the majority of my three decades of life thinking I was broken, sub-human, and disgusting. That I was undeserving of love, care or safety. That I was a liar, a drama queen, and a manipulator. Thinking that all the discomfort, fear, and sadness I felt every day was imaginary. 

And now I have an answer! A diagnosis that makes my entire confusing life finally make sense. A diagnosis that finally gives me the tools to take care of myself and start learning to be kind to myself. 

But it was a diagnosis I had to find and fight for alone. A diagnosis I will probably never be able to share with my family. I feel so fortunate to be at this point in my life, but it still hurts and feels incredibly lonely sometimes. ";;;;
2025-08-04 06:50:41;Idk what to title this;"Lately I am really struggling with the possibility of being autistic. I try to watch any videos on it or talk to my friend who has her evaluation in October and i judt feel such an over whelming rage and urge to sob. I dont understand why. Maybe im just frustrated to be back here at this possibility again and scared to be dismissed again. Scared itll take forever. Idk.

Little back story: 

I was diagnosed at age 5 or so with ADHD and I was on so many different meds over my childhood to try to find the right ones. Its hard to remember a lot of stuff from my childhood. But the i do remember feeling so trapped and alone in my mind/body. The meds would cause me to have a meltdown as soon as I got home because they didnt let me process anything I was supposed to at school...calming affect. Anyway, so I would get in trouble for my meltdowns. Sent to my room, not let out til I was done. Learned to self soothe with the TV. 

I would also shut down a lot and I felt like i couldnt ever apologize if I unintentionally hurt someone, I would feel SO sad and embarrassed that I just couldnt get the words out. Same woth my feelings in general. In certain social situations, I just couldnt talk in fear or something maybe idk. But even now some months ago, I really struggled terrible with shut downs/dissociating/ I couldnt even verbally talking to my best friend for 3 full days. Then when I did, something scary happened that made me rear for her safety and I had a panic attack and shut down again..

Anyway, all my childhood i just liked being alone, making up stories in my head, I hated playing with a big group of kids. Im a one on one or me +2 kinda person. Mainly me +1. Fast forward, I was 12 when my sister recommended to my mom to get me evaluated for autism. But I think it was not proper so they dismissed me bc it was only like an hour thing? Idk why but anyway. 

In 2020, I revisited the possibility of autism, researched so much, talked to a therapist and took all the creditible assessments i could find. I finally showed my family but they dismissed me amd said im just reaching for any label because I wanna figure out why im different than people. Anyway. I still tried to validate myself. But by 2023, I just felt very bad about doing so and eventually dismissed myself. 


Now, I was told by someone I know that I should be evaluated (they didnt know I was before) so, I took all the tests again and ive scored kinda high on all of them and I just feel so upset I think. ";;;;
2025-08-03 05:54:57;I feel like I cannot be consistently productive unless in fight or flight mode;"I recently got diagnosed with Autism Level 2. Before that I had been getting by through utilising my anxiety over how I should/ am supposed to be. I have a job and previously I was anxious and dreading everyday of work to the point of feeling ill even though its objectively easy and is WFH. I would constantly be afraid that I would be caught out as not being good enough and be fired and everyone in my life being mad at me for not being normal and keeping an easy job. I used this to make sure that I would achieve productivity even on days where I felt a bit ill. It would feel like the end of the world if I didn’t achieve productivity, even if it was down by a little bit.

Last year my family encouraged me go off sick because they eventually saw how it was affecting me. I was off for mental health reasons for many months. The issue is after this break, I have found it hard to access this anxiety and instead struggle to maintain focus and speed. I have reasonable adjustments in place (ie, part time hours, timer), which initially helped but seem to have lost their efficacy. As a result my productivity has not been consistent enough. I’m afraid I’m going to get fired. I don’t know what is wrong me or what I can do to make sure I’m doing good enough.

I do things myself to try to boost myself to do more. I used to listen to music with noise cancelling headphones but I had to stop because my family would shout at me for not being able to hear them. I do listen to music when I need to just through my phone speakers but doesn’t feel as effective. I do sometimes use fidget type things when i feel agitated in the way that i need to do something but I cant cuz I have to do my work. 

It seems most of the problem though is that I often find that I have lost time without meaning to by zoning out or unintentionally thinking in a tangent or I just get stuck on checking the same part of the task because I feel like I didn’t do it properly probably due to zoning out. I use my timer to snap me out of it but if I make it too short it gets too distracting and makes it harder to work. If it’s too long it doesn’t work. I cant seem to find the sweet spot with it. I don’t really know what else I can do about this.

I feel like each work day is this weird loop of me trying to do as much as possible but I fail at keeping in the time limits of the task and so I’m playing catch up the whole day and feels somewhat of a coin flip if I get simple tasks towards the end of the day + the burst of energy needed to rush out enough tasks towards meet productivity. I know I shouldn’t but I have worked for a short while after my shift ended on multiple occasions just so I can get my targets because I need to meet targets and I wouldn’t otherwise - sometimes it has been due to not realising the time too.

2025-08-03 03:02:02;Just Diagnosed at 30 - what now?;"Hi everyone!

I was finally diagnosed with Level 1 autism (what used to be called Asperger’s). I’ve carried the anxiety + depression label since I was a kid, so meds were always the plan—but nothing ever felt quite right. My psychiatrist took a deeper look, had me tested, and boom: missing puzzle piece located.

I’m actually relieved, because it explains why I’ve always felt “off.” Now I’m trying to flip the script from “something is wrong with me” to “this is just how I’m wired.” Easier said than done.

If you’ve walked this road, I’d love to hear:
- What helped you ditch the self-blame and accept the diagnosis?
- Low-pressure resources (books, podcasts, routines, TikTok accounts) that didn’t overload you?
- Tips for explaining the new diagnosis to friends/family who only know the anxiety/depression story?
- Biggest challenge I see: handling crowds and noisy places. I would just avoid them because I'd end up ""lashing out"" when overwhelmed and going home, ruining my day and whoever else was with me. I don't want that. I want to enjoy these things. 

Thanks in advance for any advice, stories, or gentle reality checks. ";;;;
2025-08-02 16:19:57;Advice needed regarding assessment/evaluation;"Hello, I am Poc and 25f, had an evaluation when I was 12 years old apparently.  (I have a VERY hard time remembering certain areas/situations in my childhood due to trauma, so I rely heavily on what family etc say.) and i cannot find the paperwork btw and my mother cannot either, but apparently my sister suggested i get seen. I vaguely remember sitting across from someone with my head on the table most of the time. Anyway, nothing came of it i guess because my family denies that I may be autistic, even though i presented a lot of research and why I relate etc. 

They dismissed me, so I dismissed myself i guess. (BTW I also am diagnosed adhd, apparently sometimes it can mask autism amd vice versa? Any thoughts on that?) 

I am very scared to go back to therapy in general, but someone i know who is the last person i would expect to say this or point it out, said I should get evaluated (they didnt know I had previously) but, how do I approach this? Do I just tell them about my life/experiences amd let them as the therapist say, ""Hey, it sounds like you may be autistic, let's get you evaluated"" or should I outright say, ""I am here with the purpose of figuring out if i am on the spectrum, here is my own gathering of info and here are all the reasons I relate.""

I am just really stressed because im having a hard time finding long term therapy vs short term 3-4 month sliding scale programs and i worry because its short term, maybe im going into qrong each time. Like with the wrong attitude, ""its short term, whats the point of connecting woth someone and fully sharing my past and trying to get answers if its short term and they cant diagnose me or refer me to someone who can?"" (They were college therapists or volunteer for credit kind of people) 

Im also just scared that I'll be dismissed again or not believed so I just need to know how to best handle this...as natural as I possible can??  Sorry for such a long read, im even nervous to post this lol. ";;;;
2025-08-01 12:37:12;Gaslighting myself;"I recently was assessed by my therapist through several tests and some DSM5 criteria and found to be on the spectrum. She is also neuro divergent and suggested that we go through some tests after I told her what I was struggling with. I was surprised but also not really. My sister remembers when we were kids much more than I do. She tells me stories about how I would have melt downs over things like the end sticking on socks that still drive me insane. And taking baths. I hate being wet. I feel like a wet cat. And being in noisy environments that made me cry and anxious. 

The test were conclusive she didn't have to look at the results long and said the results were consistent with what she would see with someone on the spectrum. I can't help but invalidate my diagnosis. Even though I struggle to great degrees. Can't form deep relationships. Hate eye contact, am not good at starting or stopping conversations, have trouble identifying and processing emotions, have issues with auditory stimuli and have self harming and alcoholic issues due to all these. I have no friends only acquaintances. 

I have hated myself for my whole life because of these things. Have always believed I was weird or awkward or just not like others. I believed I was not like other people and that I didn't belong here which came with a severe suicide attempt that involved totaling car and overdosing on Xanax which landed me in the hospital. I have had trips to mental hospitals multiple times under suicide watch.

I thought after my therapist unequivocally said you are autistic I am certain that maybe a formal diagnosis would help me accept myself. Only to find out that it doesn't really matter. People are still going to invalidate my experiences and tell me that everyone struggle with the same things. I just want to be understood. My sister is the only one who truly believes and was the one who told me that I should explore being autistic and I am grateful for that. But in reality it changes nothing. That thought is so painful. I will still struggle with the same things. I desperately want friends but also am terrified of people and having to perform. I do this everyday as a front desk agent at a hotel which is so exhausting that I can hardly stand it sometimes. 

I'm so depressed. Being acknowledged even when I can't acknowledge it myself is a good feeling but I still just want to die. I'm so tired of existing is a wold I don't belong in. I was told to try to find a community of people who understand but I don't fit anywhere. I'm tired just so F#$& tired. 😞";;;;
2025-08-01 11:30:04;Diagnosed with ADHD and Level 1 ASD Symptoms. Am I Considered on the Spectrum? [28F];"Hello everyone, I am a 28 year old female and was just diagnosed with ADHD and Level 1 ASD Symptoms, but no formal ASD diagnosis. My doctor explained that because I am a woman and “highly functional”, my ADHD is probably masking my ASD and that is why I do not qualify for a Level 1 ASD diagnosis. My doctor said that if I start ADHD medication, my ASD symptoms might grow and then I may meet the criteria for an actual diagnosis if I were to go through testing again. Has anybody else ran into this situation? While I do want answers regarding ASD, I am not sure if I want to go through testing all over again in the future. Also, do I consider myself “on the spectrum”? I relate a lot to people on the spectrum and now I worry I don’t belong in that community since I just have “symptoms”, not a formal Level 1 diagnosis.

Edit: The ASD symptoms listed in my diagnosis are delayed verbal response time impacting conversation, naiveté, restricted interests, and inflexible thinking.";;;;
2025-08-01 02:50:05;I have accepted so many things about myself but I HATE feeling like I make others uncomfortable. I struggle to understand why this happens, but I feel like my presence is often negative. Is it all in my head?;"Hi everyone.

Technically I am diagnosed with NVLD, but I think most of you would see me as a fellow Aspergirl and it's more or less how I identify. 

I was a super Aspie, shy kid. I think my sort of selective mutism and anxiety made people uncomfortable around me. Like, no one knows what to say to me, I would respond awkwardly to any conversational bids, and I would look all tense and anxious. I think I have improved in many of these aspects today, but to a large part they are still there. 

I'm super uncomfortable with silence now, and will always be awkwardly trying to fill it by asking dumb questions. Unfortunately, I think I have developed some sort of classically conditioned response towards white people, especially blonde, anglo-saxon looking girls, because that's who I grew up with for the most part and always felt rejected by. I don't believe this is justified but I think it explains my awkwardness in many social situations. 

Most recently the issue I am running into is with my brother's girlfriend. Now, she may also not be the friendliest person in the world, who knows. But I feel like I make her uncomfortable. I am 6 years older than her, so maybe she just doesn't know what to say to me. But I feel like I do make an effort to ask her questions about her life, but she just doesn't seem interested. And idk, do you guys know the look? It's like some look I get from people that just communicates to me that they are slightly uncomfortable. And it's the worst when 5 minutes later you see them hitting it off with someone else. 

I hate that I don't understand why or how this happens or how to just appear normal for a bit. It makes me feel so self-conscious and I start having dark thoughts. It sucks because like, my family was one of the few groups I could really unmask with, not that they're my best friends or anything, but I wouldn't feel anxious. My brother has lived with this girl for two years now, so my guess is they're in it for the long haul. Idk, I just feel so dismayed by the situation. It's not like she's mean, but I don't think she'll ever enjoy being around me. I also feel bad that I am making her feel this way.

Ughh...this is when I start wondering what the point of my existence is. I wish I could just be a normal daughter for my family. I almost feel like family gatherings would be better off without me. What's the point of me being there, really?";;;;
2025-08-01 01:48:57;An obvious insight: I can explain my traits, without having to rush to say that I'm autistic;"Feedback on my Reddit posts helps me so much! Someone gave feedback on one of my posts that helped me realize: It is not always necessary for me to explicitly state my autistic identity. Instead, I can just matter-of-factly tell people about the traits that I have, one at a time as needed, in order to feel open about myself. As a self-diagnosed, level-1, high-masking individual, this might become my new strategy.

Here are some things I might say about myself:

* “I’ve found that I need vast amounts of alone time to feel my best.”
* “I tend to get very fixated on the subjects I’m passionate about, one of them being \_\_\_\_\_.""
* ""I have a low amount of energy for obligation, so I'm careful not to commit to much. I keep my options open.""
* ""I'm sensitive and socially unique.""
* ""I often prefer slower, more indirect forms of human contact, like voice notes.""
* ""I stretch and dance differently from most people, and at times, I fidget aggressively.""
* ""I love doing certain things the same way over and over and over!""
* ""I talk to myself. A lot. Out loud and in writing. I journal as if paper were my lungs, the pencil lead air's oxygen.""
* ""Video content can be overstimulating for me; I prefer reading text.""
* ""I am 32 years old and I love Carmen Sandiego! I think of her constantly!""

I love finding ways of describing these things that feel confident, unabashed.

These mini explanations of myself can express what I need—and invite connection and understanding—but in a safe, incremental way. That feels a lot easier than accelerating from nondescript to autistic too fast. Because it definitely has hurt in the past whenever I've suggested I'm autistic and had someone not understand, believe, or know how to respond. It feels worth it to protect myself from repeating that experience. I can build up to the topic of autism more cautiously, and have more effective conversations about it when it's meant to be.

It all seems so obvious now. It doesn't have to be ""play the A card or stay silent."" There's a middle ground! My brain just got stuck on autism because, well, it's one of my hyperfixations.

Do any of you use this same trick? If so, what phrases do you keep in your back pocket to tell the story of you?

Also, I completely understand if other people prefer to take the opposite approach and just say they're autistic abundantly.

*P.S. I wrote this post in my own words, no AI involved. I mention this in all of my posts now because otherwise some people assume, which hurts my feelings because I do put great effort into crafting what I want to say. However, I also think that AI assistance can help many people with clarifying their thoughts and getting their words out effectively, and AI-generated text may very well be a truthful match to the author's own thoughts and experiences, depending on how they went about it.*";;;;
2025-08-01 01:30:49;33M - What to expect?;"This has taken a lot for me to post this, so please bear with me! Words don’t come easily. 

I want to say in advance this place has been great for seeking advice and want to thank others for sharing questions and experiences. 

I’ve felt for a long time I’m different. Throughout my life I have been on different anxiety and depression meds, and until recently have always concluded that anxiety and depression have been why I am the way I am. 

What changed was the constant tiredness and being told it was burnout. I had time off work last year (this has happened more than once over a range of jobs) and have gone part time, but the constant fatigue is still there. As is the frustration of not knowing why I feel the way I do. 

Looking into it more, I discovered autistic burnout and following some screening believe I may be autistic. I am awaiting a formal diagnosis and report meeting (next few weeks) and am happy to share updates.

For some background to why I have gone down this route - I’ve always been ‘quirky’. I’ve never considered autism before because I have been generally good at reading emotions (especially negative ones) and am empathetic. 

However, the need to recover following social interactions and just struggling with social interaction in general, enjoying my own company rather than that of others, struggles with people at work because of very black and white thinking and seen as a trouble maker because of it, difficulties with change in routines. Something clicked and started to make sense. 

The reason for the post is doubting that it is autistic burnout and an increasing anxiety about my formal meeting. What do I expect? What if it is something else? What if it’s in my head? And then if I am autistic, how does that affect my life. How will work see me? My friends and family?

I suppose I’m just looking for others who have felt the same, or had a similar experience to that of my own of looking for diagnosis later in life. How did you find it? And how did it help you, regardless of the outcome?

2025-07-31 03:01:48;I have some regrets;"I live in France . I am fluent in English but not perfect. I want to shared my school experience and thoughts about this now .
I was diagnosed at the age of 15 but my mom was suspicious about me since I was a baby. I was in 1993 and it was difficult to me to understand what’s going on with me. 
Never I used to masked up my autistic traits because I didn’t know how and in primary school or kindergarten I feel normal because I have some friends. I really love them but i prefer to speak to my teacher. 
I don’t have a problem at primary school . Just mathematics . Numbers was not for me. I remember the first exercise that make me feel bad to be me. A kind of exercise with a lot of calculs and a witch drawing near to this mathematical problem. But I didn’t have  problems yet. Because I feel normal because people seems appreciated my weirdness 


Anyway, they seemed to be my friends I remember going to some birthday parties, but not all of them. But that didn't bother me. As for school subjects, I didn't like maths anyway. You might be surprised to hear that I remember the first time I realised how complex maths could be. I remember it being all sorts of calculations piled on top of each other. Next to that was a drawing of a witch. I guess you had to help the witch. It was very complicated!

Then, my class and I went back to school, secondary school I remember being excited to start secondary school. It looked like it was going to be great.
However, my excitement was short-lived when the school decided to put me in a class where I didn't know any girls. Only two boys from my primary school were in my class, and we weren't close. I didn't know what to do. I asked to change classes, but they seemed to think I was making a fuss for nothing. Since I didn't speak up, I tried to make friends in this class. But they thought I was weird because I was following a group of girls. Apparently, you had to ask them, otherwise you couldn't do anything. Then, during a lesson, I didn't understand an exercise and I just wanted to know what to do. When I looked at my neighbour's sheet, she got really annoyed with me. All hell broke loose, and I was teased — sometimes even bullied. And some  my old friend from primary school became ennemis or silent person . I didn't understand what was happening to me because I didn't find out I was autistic until I was fifteen. The teachers were no better than the pupils. One teacher even suggested that I should have gone to a school for people with intellectual and mental disabilities, as they couldn't do much with me.

My only regret is that I wasn't strong enough to endure it all. I should have tried harder at school.


But I didn't have that interest. When I came home from school, I was so mentally and physically tired that I didn't really do anything. I knew I had the ability, as evidenced by the fact that I registered for the baccalauréat as an independent candidate at the age of 23. However, I had the misfortune to enrol at university and go to the office of a lady who told me to go and get help myself, despite my disability. That's what a Spanish teacher suggested to me when I asked her if I could take a Spanish language course.

Today, I don't have a university degree. Strangely enough, I miss school, or rather the image I had of it when I was little. I dream that one day I'll have a chance, but I know that at 31 it would be impossible. I love the buildings of French lycées, except the ones that have let me down. I love the idea of learning every day. I'm interested in everything. I would have liked to be a doctor in oncology or haematology. Or a vet, but I'm mentally tired of the idea of training. My adult life is pretty tiring at the moment. I've been abandoned by a lot of people promising training, and I'm also afraid of spending my money on something I'd give up on.

I'm not looking for anyone to feel sorry for me. I just want to be read and understood.

Thanks

2025-07-31 00:43:22;Are those things due to autism?;"15F diagnosed recently and wondering if those things are symptoms.


I don’t like spending to much time with people. Or talking with them for to long, it tend to makes me extremely annoyed and give me a weird uncomfortable feeling. Usually when I feel tired of talking to someone I start answering with very short answers, not answer at all, or stutter, I tend to act in a ruder way, I’m wondering if it is due to autism or if I’m just introverted.

This also causes me to cancel hang outs with friends at the last minute, because I dont feel like going out or talking to anyone, and I also tend to rush my hang outs with friends ESPECIALLY when they talk to much



I also simply just…. Hate dirty stuff. What I mean is that, if my plate has even the smallest spot on it, like even a tiny thing that wont affect the quality of my food, I’m gonna switch it, because the fact that it was the slightest dirty will be on my mind and I’ll feel disgusted while eating. Same goes for my forks, spoons or knives, but I typically just clean them. I also hate drinking in the same glasses as someone else, I find that really disgusting for some reasons.


I also tend to sniff my food before eating, especially if it’s something I never ate, if I dont like the smell I simply won’t eat.

Oh and also, I tend to notice even the smallest change of taste in food I really like, like salmon, I remember one day my dad had cooked it with a different brand of butter and I immediately felt the weird taste, result? I ate a few pieces of it then told my dad I really didnt like the new taste.";;;;
2025-07-30 20:49:10;extreme emotional regulation difficulties;"Hi! I was recently diagnosed with autism (I'm almost 20) so it gave me insight on what could be described as meltdowns. 
These meltdowns can surely be caused by being sensory overwhelmed (eg., crowded places, loud places etc...) but most of the time, as of lately, they are emotional. 
I would start crying, shaking, hitting myself, having urges to sh etc etc.. I tend to feel them building up throughout the day and then they explode usually when I am with my partner. The last one happened a week ago after a long day at the end of which he didn't want to call me and I got to the point of spam calling him in tears. A few days later we talked and now I am perfectly fine and convinced I won't allow myself to get to that place again. But I know it'll probably happen again. And I am absolutely embarrassed of this. Not only is it a problem for me but I make it my partner’s problem and my family and close friends' problem as well since I go to them for support. 
I am so tired of these mood swings. Does anyone have any advice? I have been in therapy for 5 years and this has only gotten slightly more manageable, so I was also thinking if I could get some sort of medication. ";;;;

one of my friends(neurotypical) has recently shown more and more dismissiveness or like disregard to my boundaries in that way. When we talk about it in our friend group she Is always reacting like im ""playing it up"" or overreacting. Whenever she wants to insult someone she uses the word autistic for that. and those things make me uncomfortable

I have tried talking to her about the latter once but it was honestly ignored and she reacted by saying ""brooo"" in like a dismissive tone as if I need to calm down.  
I do want to talk to her about it again because it genuinely affects me but I don't know how.  
I am scared she will just dismiss me again and if not will just go back to acting that way, which she has done before. I need help, I do not know how to handle this issue and if I don't say something it will set a bad mood for the entire group.";;;;
2025-07-30 03:51:57;Coworkers making fun of autism & coworkers they think are autistic.;"TLDR: Feeling sad because coworkers are gossiping about other coworkers, placing unfair judgments on them, and propagating stereotypes about autism.

I recently started a new seasonal job and we all live together in one of our two staff houses.

A few weeks ago I walked in on some coworkers gossiping in the common room about another coworker in the other staffhouse - calling him autistic because he is ‘nerdy’ (something to do with him having made his own elaborate costumes for halloween. Obviously being invested in something or highly skilled in an area doesn’t in and of itself make one autistic.

Ironically, when this particular individual displays behaviours that might quite actually align with autism such as: rigidity when it comes to following prescribed rules, inflexibility/struggles with schedules and things changing unexpectedly, etc. - my coworkers just call him ‘childish’ and having a ‘bad personality.’

They’re clearly basing their judgements off of kind of common stereotypes and drawing conclusions from that. 

I have no idea whether this individual is autistic or not. I haven’t spent a ton of time with him but he seems like a nice person, whether neurodivergent or not. He (nor anyone else) deserves to be gossiped about by their coworkers behind their back. I feel really gross when I hear them gossiping and I don’t know how they don’t feel any kind of shame being so rude towards others. (They also gossip about other coworkers - calling them stupid for messing something up, judging what they eat/cook, calling another coworker autistic because he apparently seems to miss social cues, etc.) 

When they call other people autistic, it’s not in any semblance of a considerate, genuine way, like “oh, perhaps this person is struggling in this way or behaving in this way because they are neurodivergent” it’s more like “this person is a weird freak and I’m gonna make fun of them to everyone behind their back teehee.”

Same group of coworkers also spent a whole conversation once making fun of the RAADS-R and saying well ‘if that’s how you diagnose autism, everyone is autistic.’ Yes that screener lacks a lot of nuance and maybe can seem a little silly, but it still has use, especially when applied in a clinical setting.

I don't expect that most people are extensively familiar with how autism presents, but whether these people they're mocking are autistic or not, they're behaviour is still really gross, especially considering they're making fun of them to CURRENT coworkers literally AT our place of employment.

It’s just been making me sad. Part of me wants to say something but it also makes me mad that I feel like the burden of education falls to me simply because I’m autistic and happen to understand at least \*some\* (I’m still learning too) of the nuances a bit more from extensive research and my own diagnostic journey, etc. I also don’t really feel like telling these people I’m autistic because I feel like that’ll open up more opportunity for gossip and judgment just towards me. For all I know they already make fun of me considering how open they are with gossiping about others, because I definitely come across a bit reclusive and standoffish (I’m heckin tired from masking in a very social job during the day and often don’t feel like socializing after work).

A lot of them (me too) have ADHD too and really embrace the neurodivergent identity, so it makes me more sad to see such intolerance to other forms of neurodivergence. 

I’ve been considering disclosing my diagnosis to explore accommodations for work, and stuff like this makes me want to ram myself all the way back into the closet and build even stronger masks.

2025-07-30 02:43:03;I’m 17, and I feel stuck. I wish I could get a diagnosis now.;"- Hi. I’m 17 and I strongly suspect I’m autistic. I’ve done a lot of research, and I relate deeply to so many experiences shared by people on this subreddit. I feel like I’ve finally found something that explains things I’ve struggled with for the most part of life. But I’m stuck.

- I want to go to therapy and get a proper diagnosis, but I can’t. The psychologist I reached out to said I need my parents’ consent, and I just can’t involve them right now. Telling them would make things even harder for me emotionally and mentally. I know some people have supportive parents, but sadly that’s not my case.

- So now I feel trapped. I feel like I’m just counting down the days until I turn 18, which is the legal age where I live to go to therapy on my own. I know that’s not so far away, but every day feels incredibly heavy, and I’m tired. I wish I could get help now. I don’t want to waste more time feeling lost and misunderstood. 

- I’m not trying to self-diagnose for attention or anything. I just need some peace of mind, some clarity. Maybe others here have been in a similar situation and can relate? It would help just to know I’m not alone.

- Thanks for reading if you got this far.";;;;

right now my husband is paying for everything but we might divorce. if that happens i am terrified of whats going to happen. i have no friends and im not close to my family and getting a diagnosis here can take up to 3 years and even if i get that the doctor said to me before that just because i have autism and adhd doesnt mean i cant work, theres lots of people who have both but they still have a job and then he started to plan to get me to work without pay to start off. 

i feel i cant speak up for myself and that im at a disadvantage because its really hard for me to talk and explain myself why i cant work for example and just like having a conversation but also i know he doesnt care about me and no matter what i say he will deny me the help i need.

2025-07-29 14:23:00;How can I tell if I have autism or social anxiety?;It’s hard for me to figure out if I have autism or just social anxiety, I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teenager and not diagnosed with autism until last year. I’m 27 now. What if I am just dealing with social anxiety all this time? I feel like I can get social cues pretty well even though I’ve been told that I haven’t in the past. For example my mom came with me to a doctor appt and my doctor was apparently being rude to me and I didn’t catch it at all, my mom had told me. But that’s just only one example! I had to train myself to understand people’s intentions because I used to get taken advantage of especially by men a lot in my life. However I am wondering if I just have anxiety or if I have autism too. Like what if I fooled my psychiatrist or something and I really have anxiety. I feel like I should get another assessment done. Would you suggest getting another assessment done? ;;;;
2025-07-29 05:43:38;I am so tired of not having answers;"I have no ability to express my pain. I have no language for it.

The only mental health resources I have available is a community center. They do not do formal diagnosis. They just write prescriptions. That means that:

Despite taking enough sedatives to knock out a horse every day, I don't have anxiety.  
Despite barely being able to get up and get through each day, I don't have depression.  
Despite trying to starve myself every day, I don't have an eating disorder.  
Despite dealing with a voice/identity in my head that's not my own, there is nothing wrong with me.

I guess I just happen to need antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics for ""reasons"".

Obviously I cannot afford an ASD evaluation. That is never happening for me.

Despite this, earlier this week I finally accepted that I am probably autistic. I've had every clue staring me in the face but kept denying it.

It doesn't matter though. It changes nothing. I don't get to use the words I need to describe what I deal with. I don't get to validate my experiences because they apparently have no clinical cause.

I can't tell my friend ""sorry I struggle with \_\_\_ because I am autistic."" I can't find communities of people like me. I can't get accommodations. 

Most importantly, I can't say to myself *I am dealing with xyz really bad today and need help.* 

Because there is nothing wrong with me. I can't get the pieces of paper so once again, just like with everything else...I have no reasons or excuses. I'm not sick, I'm not neurodivergent.

I'm pathetic, weak, sensitive, incompetent. A failure. There are no reasons why I can't be like everyone else besides my own failing.

I don’t t feel like a child and I’m not trying to act like a child.
But many things that are labeled as “for kids” – whether it’s dishes, pictures, bedding, furniture, or clothing – feel deeply comforting and meaningful to me.

I love how they look and how they make me feel. They are soft, calm, quiet to the touch or in use. They have a cute, playful, or gentle appearance that feels safe and warm. They are often simple, clear, and visually organized – like a divided plate or a piece of furniture that creates a cozy space.
I’ve arranged my room this way – with children’s furniture, pictures on the walls, a house-shaped bed, bedding with cute patterns.
I also love children’s clothing – for its colors, prints, animals, and charming details. It honestly saddens me that almost none of this exists for adults. Sometimes I envy small children for having access to this beauty, especially since they often don’t even notice it.

This isn’t about playing or escaping into childhood. It is not nostalgia either.
It’s about aesthetics, sensory comfort, and a feeling of safety in the middle of a big world. Quiet, calm, personal. It simply makes me feel happy. It’s hard for me to understand why adults don’t like these.

My family thinks it’s weird, silly and inappropriate. They laugh at me, and I feel ashamed because of that. Even as a child, I often liked things that were meant for younger kids and my family was against it.
But it doesn’t harm anyone. And it genuinely helps me. It makes me feel calmer, more at peace, and more like myself.

Does anyone else have a similar experience? Do you like things that are made for kids? How does your family or other people react to it?

(Pictures show my bedroom, which I designed a year ago.)

2025-07-28 20:03:27;Misdiagnosed as social communication disorder?;"Today I was diagnosed with social communication disorder. I personally disagree with this diagnosis (I am an adult female, and English is not my Mother language)

First of all, I think that the way I was diagnosed is a little bit flawed. In my country, the way we diagnose autism spectrum is very lacking. 

And I heard that abroad, neuropsychologists and other psychologists diagnose after hours of long interviews and in-depth assessments, but in my country, they diagnose through a full battery test, which is not an autism screening test. I took the full battery, which included Mmpi, tci, projection test, iq test, etc. And in my country, as an adult, ADOS is not that possible. 

And the family interviews i took were only about 15 minutes per person, and they said I was fine. 

And the test results said social communication disorder, not autism spectrum disorder: high intelligence, temperamental factors, no noticeable repetitive behaviors or clearly limited interests. 

They even said that my mood factor is a key factor, and
I've been told that anyone who has room for acquired improvements, such as masking and intelligence, among other things, is not autistic. They said that i could adjust and improve myself throughout years so i wasn’t autistic. What does this mean?! I was just heavily masked and grew up from a very restrictive and controlling household. 

I'm upset. I was emotionally abused by my parents from a very young age due to my naturally high sensory sensitivity, and I have special interests that are popular but interfere with my daily life. 

And I'm a highly intelligent adult female who masks very heavily, and someone who is highly intelligent and has room for improvement through masking isn't autistic in the first place? 

I feel so hopeless about the way our country is diagnosing. I have already visited six psychiatrists, four of which were for autism-related reasons. It is very, very difficult to get an official diagnosis for a masked adult female in a country like mine. 

I actually already have an unofficial diagnosis from another hospital. It's not an official document (it's very difficult for adults to get official documents in my country). I spent a lot of money to get rid of my imposter syndrome and went to the hospital, only to be told that I have a social communication disorder. Improving my social skills won't help me fit in at work or live like an NT, and I don't know what to do. 

What do you think?!";;;;
2025-07-28 13:41:51;Self diagnosed, burned out, seeking advice;"Hello friends — I’ve recently self diagnosed as autistic. I’m a 35 year old woman who’s severely burned out, and I’m seeking practical advice on what to do next. Relevant context - I’ve been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and ADHD. 

I think I’ve been burned out since age 14, possibly earlier (but my memories before that age are quite vague). At a young age, I could be described as intelligent and “gifted” but also exceptionally, debilitatingly shy. School was hard for me… I don’t feel particularly intelligent but rather just that I put obsessive perfectionist effort into school, all why wondering why I was doing it. I didn’t even underhand why I tried so hard as I didn’t have a particular goal in like and since doing well in school was killing me. I was unable to control my own ability to get homework or studying done, feeling so overwhelmed and utterly helpless. Let’s say I had a 5 page essay due the next day. I’d often cry hysterically the night before, paralyzed and unable to write, hating myself for my inability to just sit down and work and feeling like I just couldn’t do it. Sometimes I’d wake my mom up at 2am in hysterics saying I couldn’t do it. Sometimes I’d nap in the wee hours of the morning. Then maybe at 4am, the ability to write or study would hit magically. 
I’d frantically type and miraculously get it done. The anxiety throughout the whole process (including when actually writing) was horrific. My ability to be productive was entirely out of my control, but somehow I managed to get straight A’s and get into a great college. I feigned normalcy and happiness during the day and broke down constantly once home and alone.  

Do I have social difficulties too? Yes, absolutely.  Always have. However, until about 5 years ago, I would’ve said “no” to this question — not from lying but from a carefully constructed self delusion, I guess. The primary problems I identified with were severe treatment-resistant depression and not being able to control my own ability to be productive. I internally, subconsciously dismissed my social difficulties as being unimportant, normal, honestly even non-existent because I wanted to just perceive myself as  “normal” socially. Quirky was fine— but in a charming, within-normal-range way. I don’t know… the world gaslit me and I leaned into self delusion too. I don’t know how to describe it better right now, and I don’t have it in me to try to explain better right now. 

Anyway, I’ve always felt fundamentally different from everyone else; exceptionally shy, nervous, and overwhelmed; and that life is just so hard for me for no fucking reason.. but I was told (and I internalized) that it’s just because I was doing so much and being an over achiever… or it’s because of my illogical, overly negative thoughts. I deeply resented and disagreed with the “illogical thoughts cause your depression” trope for myself because I am highly logical. “I really don’t think I can function like this forever, I just cannot possibly do it” was not negative self-talk for me but an expression of what I knew deep down to be true: I was disabled in a way that I couldn’t name (nor could an indefinite number of psychiatrists). At age 25, I even had ECT (“shock therapy”) for my treatment resistant depression. Like everything else, it didn’t help. 

Now at age 35, I’m newly realizing I’m likely autistic. I don’t know what to do, though— so I came here to brain dump. I cannot function in this world and don’t know what to do. I’ve tried so hard my entire life. My ability to function in a way that was high- or even high-enough achieving stopped at the end of college. I managed to graduate on time despite being severely burned out, but then went to my parents’ house and slept for a year after that. My 13 post-college years have been like this: working for 1-2 years, then quitting and sleeping/crying/doing little else for like 6 months, repeat. I can’t do it anymore. My longest period having “full time” (ish) work is recently… about 4-5 years straight. All I can do is work and sleep and literally nothing else, because i’m at capacity. Over capacity, honestly, which is the problem. I’m on the verge of breaking and am at my lowest point ever— also I’m just completely unable to fake normal socially anymore. How funny (read: not at all funny) that when I’m on-paper functioning at work the best/longest I ever have… really I’m internally at my absolute worst. 

I feel like a failure for getting worse at social stuff when I used to be okay at it. I’ve realized the past few years, I’ve been unmasking (though I didn’t have the word for it til recently)— but I’m still perpetually overwhelmed and not at all okay. (Unmasking is supposed to help with that overwhelm, right?) It also sucks because the unmasking isn’t a choice. Nothing is a choice anymore. My life right now is not a choice— I do whatever I can handle, which is almost nothing. I’m single and childless and almost completely alone. I don’t see issues with those things in an objective sense, but it sucks to feel like nothing was a choice. I’m here because it’s all I can handle. I’m terrified I won’t be able to work (prob going to lose my job soon) and then what? I can’t work full time, it’s just not sustainable for me— and I don’t understand how to maintain my existence financially/logistically for the rest of my life. I also wonder what’s the point, if every moment is so overwhelming and unenjoyable even when I can function somewhat. Note: I’m not suicidal and never have been… somehow. I don’t know why/how not, honestly. I’m just not. 

Thoughts on next steps? Self diagnosis has been helpful but idk what to do next or how to exist in this world that wasn’t built for me— even if I understand myself better now. I also feel like I’ve been burned out my entire life, is that a thing? I don’t even think I have special interests or any interests bc all I’ve done my whole life is pour every ounce of effort into what I think I SHOULD do. I don’t even have hobbies or interests or really even a sense of self at this point.

That word-vomit may not have made any sense. But I’m grateful for this community and for having a place to dump it, even if no one reads it. Thank you, autistic community, for giving me a modicum of relief in this hard life. I love y’all, honestly! Thank goodness for other not-normal people <3";;;;
2025-07-28 12:24:19;Help explaining Autistic traits to Grandma I moved in with;"

Hello there. So I'm 24 (Nonbinary Male) I have Autism and ADHD have been diagnosed since I was in early elementary school. Recently about a week ago my partner (23) and I moved in with my grandmother (late 60s), as we were having financial problems with the rise of rent and I am inherenting the house from her after she passes. It's a good opportunity for all of us.
But we have run into a couple bumps that I'm hoping to get some advice on 
She is a very she likes it efficient as possible, type person she believes as soon as you finish eating you rinse of your plate and put it in the dishwasher and there should never be more then like 3 dishes in the sink

And that laundry should be put straight into the washer as soon as you finish changing
And having everything as organized and compact as possible 
And things like that


I on the other hand thrive in slight organized chaos and have trouble when things are to clean cause it provides extreme pressure on me to not mess it up

I also have trouble interrupting tasks and projects to do things like washing dishes immediately (cause the water feels and sound and seeing wet food scraps on plates mess with my sensory issues)
or putting clothes in the dryer out in the garage right after changing or putting trash in the trash can right away (the smell of trash cans sets me off)
for example cause they mess up my routine and timing and especially mess with my concentration and breaks my flow to the point where I can't continue what I'm doing 
I normally do all my dishes at the end of the day or throw close in a laundry hamper and wash it when it's full or put trash in a pile or a mini trash can and do it all at once. I am a strong believer of a room is clean if I can have it fully done and ready for guests within 10 to 15 minutes notice.


It's things like that and she knows I have autism and a good part of the symptoms but I don't think she fully understands how it works and that it's not that I'm being lazy or trying to not corporate or be unproductive it's that my brain is wired differently.

It doesn't help that even though for the first year and a half my partner and I lived in the apartment it was kept pretty clean but the last 6 months with financial stress and getting ready to move and a lot of other stressful things we fell pretty behind on cleaning and ended up in a state where it was better to focus on packing than deep cleaning 
and a vast majority of the time she saw our apartment was in those 6 months or where we knew she was coming beforehand and even though it was already clean we deep cleaned to make it look nice for her so she never saw how it normally was and assumes we are always messy which we are not we just have a certain way of doing things



I'm looking for advice on how to talk to her about this and help her understand that I am trying and my brain works a certain way, and I need help coming up with possible compromises that might work 


Thank you for reading, sorry about lack of punctuation typed out quickly, if you want any more information or clarification please let me know.

I would love any advice and suggestions on what could help 


Thank you

2025-07-27 19:26:37;Opinions :);Hey. Long story but maybe read it if you’re interested. I was diagnosed with asd when I was 19. I had been struggling ever since I left school to communicate like a normal person once I got older. During school, especially secondary, I communicated in very bizarre ways I.e echolalia. Had a few other traits like sensory issues, no eye contact, no facial expressions, ahead in maths as a child, didn’t play with toys as a child, preferred adult company in school reports and stressed when change in routine, epilepsy, toe walking, family with asd traits. But I have always picked up on social cues, been popular as a kid (might have helped that I was kinda good looking lmao) but I never had any really intense interests etc. I was also very antisocial and had a severe conduct disorder and did some terrible violent things in rage. Do you think the diagnosis was correct? Thanks. I also just did another evaluation with the ados-2 etc. and I got 14 score which is pretty high.. I just have this imposter syndrome that autistics are non violent naive angels and I certainly wasn’t one of them… but the obvious traits just make no sense otherwise… thanks for any feedback :);;;;
2025-07-27 04:05:39;Difference between meltdown and panic attack?;I've heard some people mistake meltdowns for panic attacks until they're diagnosed, and I've been wondering about that myself. I can't tell if I just get unusual panic attacks or if they're something else. Mine usually build for hours, usually in public/social setting, before reaching a point where I sort of can't stand or even sit up straight from the breathing. My therapist remarked it's unusual how visible my panic attacks are, and how I somewhat lose control of my body (not completely). So I don't know if they're just panic attacks, since I know panic attacks are on a spectrum, or if it's worth bringing up the possibility that it could be something else. So what's your experience with both/either, and what are the main differences between them? Thanks so much!;;;;
2025-07-27 01:40:15;"The ""too many being diagnosed"" argument.";Whenever someone says too many are being diagnosed at the moment, this is why. It also helps as a reminder for those newly diagnosed (like myself) who have had some fairly severe imposter syndrome after receivng official confirmation.;;;;
2025-07-25 21:14:57;Meltdown questions for how to handle as an adult;"Hi! 

I strongly suspect I might be AuDHD - I am recently diagnosed ADHD but have my Autism assessment in 2 weeks. Ever since I started properly considering if I’m autistic or have adhd I have been really struggling with overwhelm and feeling overstimulated. 

I’ve noticed sensitivities I never thought I had and am questioning myself over whether I’m making them up or they were always there and I didn’t notice. Anyway - lots more things are overwhelming me and I’m finding myself on the edge of or actually falling into proper meltdowns very often. I’m finding it so hard to handle a lot of things, and I know for certain some of it is emotional dysregulation triggered by the adhd but I feel like this is also feeding into emotional sensitivities I have. I feel like as soon as I start spiralling into dysregulation I can’t control my feelings and then everything tumbles down and it’s a disaster. I hit myself, get angry, and often end up crying in a ball in the bathroom and can’t recover for the next day or two. I know this is a fairly typical adhd experience but I also experience similar things when I am exposed to a sound trigger like my children crying - I’m going to buy some earplugs to reduce this as it can be unbearable.

Can anyone who has AuDHD relate to this and what are your experiences of meltdowns? Everywhere I read about autistic meltdowns being directly related to sensitivities and I know I have that from sound sometimes but I don’t know if it is also adhd feeding into it? Also has anyone else found they get a lot worse on the wait for diagnosis and during an introspective period? 

Can you suggest any advice for handling a meltdown in the moment or how to handle the aftermath? I always end up hurting (emotionally, not physically) my partner during and it feels awful. I then turn inward and hurt myself and blame myself. I want to get out of the cycle but it feels impossible at the time. 

Thanks for listening sorry about the wall of text.";;;;
2025-07-25 07:22:17;We need to talk more about anxiety and trauma from childhood.;Hi all. I got diagnosed about 2 years ago with autism. And I now am seeing traits like this overthinking over talking thing in my own life;;;;
2025-07-25 06:09:43;I think this sub might had save my life...;"Hi! Some days ago, I made my first post here about my family denying my identity. Since then, I've been reading not only all your comments on that post but also other posts in the sub. I can't believe how much the pain from my prolonged burnout has been relieved since then. For the first time in my life, I found people who say things that I had thought (like not getting the ""how are you?"" question, or not liking that food and sleep are not optional for humans). People always pointed out that I was weird for thinking those things, so until now, I had felt really lonely in that sense.

I didn’t know about the healing power of a community. I’ve been frozen, unable to work with my hands for weeks, barely surviving the emotional pain and the feeling of abandonment from my family. But being here, I’ve felt more welcomed than ever before, understood and supported. The day after my first post, I was able to begin working again, and for the first time during this burnout, I felt hope.

My burnout began because a wealthy member of my family sabotaged my small business, my only source of humble income. I worked so hard to make it succeed, and suddenly it was gone. This person doesn't take any accountability or offer any compensation for the harm they caused. Losing money, my shop, and dealing with customer complaints was too much for me. It forced me into debts I couldn’t pay in order to issue refunds.

Today, I got another refund request, but thanks to this group, I’m not sinking emotionally anymore. I haven’t solved the burnout yet, or my financial situation, but I have hope for the future. I have hope that I can get out of this, that I can learn to love and accept myself, and overcome troubles with patience.

Even if I can’t afford to get my diagnosis yet, my whole life finally makes sense now. I have no doubts about my identity, and that's a powerful place to be in. Even in the middle of chaos, I can hold on to this, what I now know. I’m not alone in the world with this kind of mind. There are other people like me who are struggling, hoping, or succeeding out there. And this community will always understand and support me in my bad times and also celebrate my good times.

This place is a refuge for the soul. I can’t thank you enough for being so kind, for not judging, for offering positive advice, for being there, just reading.

I was at the Zoom meeting on Tuesday, and at first I was afraid I couldn’t participate without a camera or mic, only to find out that it’s not required and that people can share their experiences by writing them. This is a place where I don’t need to explain my limitations... a place where I won’t be misjudged as “dramatic” or “pretentious” for how I express myself. A place where I can simply be myself and be understood.

This is healing. Thank you so much for giving me hope and helping me to keep going.";;;;
2025-07-25 06:01:37;Could I be neurodivergent, without any diagnosis?;"So, i resonate with a lot of autistic traits, and some personal experiences. 
For example, I don't react to things like others do, many people have told me that I think very differently. 
I have extreme photophobia, or light sensitivity. I feel like I am overstimulated in public surroundings, or face to face conversations, but don't know how that would actually feel like. But, conversations over text or phone seem much more comfortable and relaxed than face to face. Half the things I talked about, i can't remember later. I struggle with reading other people faces, etc. But I feel like I don't have hyperfixations, or I don't plan conversations ahead, or I am not stuck to routine, etc. Could I be autistic, vaise I can't get a formal diagnosis? But more than that, could I be neurodivergent, without any condition or disorders? ";;;;
2025-07-25 03:51:31;Do grants for autistic adults exist?;"I'm a self employed, VERY late diagnosed autistic woman (last year at 50), and have been struggling financially for a while & this year is worse. Things only seem to be getting slower as far as sales go which is scary considering sales are usually good this time of year with summer festivals and Halloween around the corner.  
I'm wondering if there are grants out there that anyone knows about for autistic adults?   
  
My therapist gave me a few links that seemed at first to be open for adults but either they led to a dead page, applications are closed or the application seems to only ask for info on children.  
I'm already working as hard as I can, and after a couple decades of working for myself I can't imagine working for an employer now. I don't even know \*how\* to job hunt now or what they expect, and I also would have to wear an N95 as I'm high risk for covid, which I know some companies tend to discriminate against.

2025-07-24 21:44:52;I was bullied but was the one punished;"When I was in elementary, other kids would purposely gather around me during recess and start trying to make me angry by making fun of the way I talk, walk and preform stimming. so I would react (by yelling or sth by a mental breakdown) and my actions would be reported to my parents and they'd have to apologize to the school lol. And i would be beaten with a stick by my parents for spilling anger at class as a punishment. ( i was diagnosed at 9, and my parents were trying to remove everything autistic about me, by actions like forcing me to look at their eyes for 15 mins per day)

My classmates would lend everyone pens and pencils, yet refuse to lend me them. When teachers tell them that they cant act like that, they would throw pens on me and enjoy seeing me have a mental breakdown. They would share snacks to all classmates with the exception of me. When I ask for them to share me snacks, they throw it on the floor, yet back then I felt thankful that I got something( and embarrassingly ate them)

My classmates would create ridiculously loud sounds around me, or bring foods for lunch that they know I cant stand the smell of, and parade around me with the dish. And yes if i yell at them my school teachers would notify my parents who would also punish me. What's extra is that people who teachers arranged to sit around me in homeroom for the month( seats are switched monthly) would be laughed to death, as it was not just hatred towards me, but also the biggest shame you would have in class. As if I was the school's plague. One girl was arranged to sit next to me and she cried in front of the teacher....

And my parents would always threaten me that if I dont change my behavior I would be beaten by death in junior high";;;;
2025-07-24 21:32:18;Death anxiety and existential dread (advice wanted);"I was wondering if anyone else experienced severe anxiety around death and existential dread and, if so, how they manage it?

I'm 26F, late diagnosed AuDHD, and I think growing up one of the main things that made me feel different from other people is my severe fear of death and constant battle with existential dread. I think I became aware of death when I was maybe 7 or 8 and it's something I've struggled with all my life, particularly in my early teenage years when I started having panic attacks nearly everyday about it. It's definitely linked with my mood as although when I'm feeling good I'm still hyperfixated on death through disaster and true crime videos, I can think about it and not really care. However, I go through periods (I think when my mood is lower) where, if my mind is not completely engaged in something, I suddenly get an intrusive thought about dying and if I don't immerse myself in something else immediately then I'll start having a panic attack as if I'm on my death bed right now (not great when it happens whilst I'm showering). 

I've tried different ways of rationalising it to myself, in particulat turning to Buddhism etc., but each rationalisation turns into its own existential crisis because I start spiralling and then question reality and existence and eternity etc. to the point where I wish I never existed and experienced sentience in the first place. The closest I've gotten to acceptance is just telling myself that at the end of the day no one knows so it's best not thinking about it, but I hate feeling like I'm clinging on to an illusion of normalcy and daily life but any moment I'll fall into these thoughts. Also death is inevitable so I know I'll need to face it one day and I fear I'll never ""grow out"" of this phobia because I'm grown now and still have it. Currently I just constantly have some sort of noise or reminder of the mundane (e.g. radio) at all times but I think it contributes to me getting overstimulated. 

The worst part is everyone I've expressed this fear to (all neurotypical) doesn't seem to understand or have experienced this so it feels quite isolating and exacerbates the feelings of detaching from reality that come with the spiraling thoughts. It's annoying as other than this I believe I've completely embraced my neurodiversity and really love being me, but having this constantly looming over me does prevent me from living a happy and carefree life.";;;;
2025-07-24 20:29:38;How to tell the difference between a special interest and addiction?;"First time posting my own, I hope I got the flair right.

About me: 31F, Recently diagnosed ADHD (ADD), working on diagnosis for Asperger's/ Autism.

I have always played video games, for as long as I can remember. Both of my parents are gamers, I received my first game console when I turned about 8 and it has been a wrap ever since. So, I am very surprised that my family is now bringing up that they feel I have an addiction to gaming.

Here is the thing though (My Side)...

\[Bolded important parts for the sake of convenience.\]

\- **I feel that it is my main special interest**. I can go on and on about Sims, Rune Factory, Fire Emblem (Awakening and Onward), Harvest Moon, Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate, so on and so forth. I never realized how much I actually knew about the lore for, not only the games themselves, but the companies as well.

\- **I have very specific interests when it comes to gaming itself.** I almost exclusively play fantasy/ strategy games-- medieval fantasy being my absolute favorite. ANYTHING with elves and dragons or a female lead are a plus. I am not a fan of linear stories with no variation (there are exceptions). I will not play a game if the main character is a man. I hate playing a man, I am tired of playing a man. I had to play a man my entire life. (I say that but there are exceptions-- Geralt from the Witcher and Kratos from God of War, damn near all of the Rune Factory or Harvest moon titles.)

\- **I have other hobbies**: horror movies, drawing women (IDK, I just find us so pretty), painting, singing/rapping/ listening to music, doing my nails, fixing furniture, decorating, gardening, and psychology research. In the last year I have started pressing flowers and playing basketball. I also cut and style my own hair (not sure if it counts but I feel like it is a hobby for me?) If you can't tell, I like to have both my hands and brain engaged.

\-**I never neglect my partner** and will turn my game off- even if it is in the middle of a cut scene- if he asks or we make spontaneous plans, or we want to spend time together.

\-**I admit that in the past I would ditch events to game**; as I have become more aware that I am, in fact, a grown ass woman, I now straight up say, ""Hey, sorry, I can't hang out that day because a game I have been waiting 10 years for came out, finally.""

\-**The only time I feel agitated/ irritated is if a new game came out that I really wanted and I am unable to play it at the time I want to play it.** Then yes, that game will be on my mind all day because I am excited to play it and I have to wade through all of the adult garbage to do so.

\-**I do own hundreds of games**, but I blame Steam for having good sales.

Here is the thing though (Family's Side)...

\-""You spend all of your time gaming and not enough time doing other things.""

\-""It can be a form of escapism.""

\-**They do not believe I have ADHD despite my diagnosis, and they most certainly don't believe that I could have Asperger's/Autism** (even though my bio father was just diagnosed this year, at the ripe age of 50, with ADHD and Autism Level 1; his special interests include video games and superheroes.)

That is all they have told me, that I can remember? I am confused because...I don't live with my family. I live with my partner and sister. **We aren't always home at the same time though and I am always in my room, so I don't understand how they have come to the conclusion that I do nothing but game?** (My partner does not agree with it being an addiction btw.)

**Additionally, I would like to add that me being in my room all of the time is not abnormal for our family dynamic. My entire life all of us would go to our own rooms and do our own things-- parents included.** We were never the type of family to hang out in the living room; honestly, the living room was more for decoration/ guests. I spent my time gaming or playing outside, but my siblings would pretty much just hang out in my space while I did my own thing.

**So as the title says, how to tell the difference between a special interest and an addiction?**

PS I also suspect that my mother may have Asperger's/Autism, but her special interest is the Bible and word parts (especially related to the Bible, she spends days scouring through it and has notebooks filled with just the breakdown of words in the Bible comparing the Greek, Hebrew, and English in great detail; this doesn't even begin to encompass all of her OTHER notes-- I mean, she has a small library of notebooks filled with her research.) I don't mind it but why is mine consider an addiction and hers not? TT\^TT";;;;
2025-07-24 05:41:00;Update for my diagnosis! Apparently it’s not autism…yet?;"So, I made a post about how nervous I was to attend my diagnosis session and turns out I went in thinking I had audhd and left being diagnosed with OCD AND ANXIETY?!?! HUH??? I GOT PRESCRIBED PROZAC?!?

Granted, the psychiatrist said that she suspects that I could also have autism but be high functioning. Although she’s unsure 100% because this was her first time meeting me and we need to have more sessions (therapy) before she can know for sure. 

I NEVER not once even thought I had OCD. HOW?!?! That’s the most RANDOM diagnosis to me. Not to say she’s wrong but..huh? She says that she does not rush to diagnose autism but will know for sure as we spend more time together. 

I explained to her my tendency to have hyper fixations on people and have a ruminating mind/racing thoughts. I told her about my issues with walking on certain surfaces without any sort of foot protection. I told her about my issues with my monotone voice and always being misunderstood. I told her about my difficulties with feeling exhausted after a lot of group activities and how I play music at loud volumes just to quiet my mind. My issues with meeting new people. 

I’m scared to take the medication, as it takes so damn long to see the effects and it’s supposed to make you feel like absolute hell before you get better. I’m already in college. I’m stressed enough and now I have to take medication that might make me feel worse than ever?! She said she’ll need more time to determine if I have autism because I can maintain long term relationships?!?!? 

Does this sound like a misdiagnosis? ";;;;
