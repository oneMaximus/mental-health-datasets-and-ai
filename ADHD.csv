2025-11-08 23:10:28;Newly Medicated - feeling nothing;"I was diagnosed in July 2024 by my therapist but didn't want to medicate. Im on so many other medications for autoimmune diseases, one more was daunting. Also i wasn't entirely sure I had ADHD. I have recently started seeing a dietician for disordered eating and she mentioned being medicated could help with a lot of the issues I have. 

So, I went through the process to get medication. Started on Vyvanse 30mg on Tuesday, I've felt nothing. Like, the only thing I possibly noticed was a dry mouth the last 2 days. Otherwise my days are the same and unchanged. 

My pcp had said to give it two weeks and then reach out to her to let her know how it's going. 

Is it possible it'll start affecting my life within the next 2 weeks? I thought it's effects were fast acting? 

Also on my mind is, do I not have ADHD? I can't help but think i must be making it up and im not sure how to get around this. I have all of the classic symptoms and...something is up, I just don't know how it was missed until I was 40 years old!";r/adhdwomen;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1orrrjs/newly_medicated_feeling_nothing/

2025-11-08 22:02:44;Advice for medication;Hello all, I've gotten myself into a bit of a pickle. I'll start by saying I was diagnosed with adhd at a very young age (around 6-7 years old) and I've been on Adderall until I was 23. I'm 28 now and haven't taken my adhd medication in years. I'm not sure what happened but during my adolescence and childhood I responded very well to Adderall,  when I was 18 it started to give me psychosis, over several years it got worse and worse until I had a massive mental breakdown and had to stay in a mental health facility for a little while. My doctor took me off Adderall,  we tried multiple different medications, vyvanse, Ritalin,  even non narcotic adhd meds, the vyvanse gave me psychosis as well, Ritalin gave me anger and mood problems and the non narcotics didn't do anything at all. My doctor refuses to put me back on Adderall,  I'm 28 now and it feels like I'm dead, I can barely function without my medication,  I have problems doing the simplest things such as cleaning.  My doctor tells me to just drink coffee but it doesn't help much. What should I do? ;r/adhdwomen;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1orq6ev/advice_for_medication/
2025-11-08 21:52:34;conditioned to be introverted;"Holding onto so much anger. The system failed me, family, schools, doctors all failed me. I was thinking about how different my life could have been if I had the right diagnosis, treatment, accommodations etc. I wasn't too shy as a child from what I remember. I recall always feeling like a ""problem"" or always causing a problem, meaning people were not pleased with me/my behavior, always getting in trouble. It wasn't my fault. A woman on an ADHD podcast said it's like having a sewing kit with no needle. I was conditioned to shut my mouth, better off staying silent & shrinking myself, trying to dissappear. 

Now 48 years old, I can't help but feel I missed out on most of my life. I'm 48 in menopause since 45-46 chronic pain, No quality of life, financially poor because of resources, lack of education. I absolutely hate my job, very little pay, constant triggers, always getting criticized by boss/supervisor, on final warning which has my anxiety through the roof, worrying about when it's coming, when is the next write up or termination. My partner is very unsupportive, he doesn't ""believe"" me saying I'm a hypochondriac, always complaining, always miserable. he thinks I diagnos myself despite having been officially diagnosed. He doesn't believe in mental health. I see a therapist & a psychiatrist. Also go to a trauma therapist for EMDR therapy. 

Wow, this turned into a rant! My point was I'm painfully shy & introverted, I don't have friends because people do not like me when I talk, they do not listen & seem disinterested. I jumble my words a lot so mahbe I'm too confsing? I don’t know if I make people feel uncomfortable, but they always seem to distract themselves and stop making eye contact. I’m good at picking up on social cues. agh!";r/adhdwomen;4;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1orpy7o/conditioned_to_be_introverted/

My family never believed it they just thought I was messy and didn’t care but now I am here and I’m scared because I don’t know what the rest of my life will look like and I have no one to talk to about it.

2025-11-08 20:31:57;A few questions about rejection sensitivity dysphoria;"I have had these questions for a while…now asking as someone diagnosed with ADHD. 

How is RSD defined and do we have an agreed definition? I have seen so many variations. 

How is RSD measured? If it cannot be defined and measured, how can we say confidently that it exists across ADHDers? 

How is RSD different from social phobia (not just social anxiety)? If the difference is related to the intensity of emotional response, how is that different from the intensity of emotional feelings experienced in people with social phobia? 

Does talking therapy for social phobia work to reduce RSD?

2025-11-08 19:15:27;ADHD making me feel hopeless;"Bit of a ramble: sorry!

I'm 34 (dx) and feel utterly hopeless about who I am or if I am even loveable.

I was diagnosed with cPTSD from a 6-year long abusive relationship. After this ended, I tried to make something of myself. I moved to another country, learned the language while attending university, and I'm now starting a PhD. 

While here, I met a man (non-dx) who was later my husband. We were together for nearly 8 years. I loved him dearly. I made conscious efforts to support him and when I noticed that I was exhibiting symptoms of my previous trauma, I sought out therapy immediately. 

My therapist told me over the course of our sessions that I was an ""excellent communicator"" and ""very empathetic"". I tend to overexplain things. Of course, I always take any compliment with a grain of salt (seld-hatred) and think that if they knew the real me, they'd hate me too (I had a narcissistic parent).

Either way, I was always upfront and open in my communications with my ex husband. We agreed that rather than letting things fester, we'd address issues directly. So I did. He did not.

I would feel his resentment toward me and ask him about it and he'd always insist that either he was ok, or still considering whether or not he was mad at me, but that he'd get back to me on it (this stressed me out of course due to past abuse). 

I used to have to frame every critique or request, no matter how small, in such a way to not result in having to tell him that he's not a bad person, just that I need XYZ.

I kept him in the loop with my therapy and told him of my PTSD diagnosis to help him understand me, along with the ADHD. I also tried to find supportive online communities for him in case it would help him. He told me back then that he had wondered what was ""wrong"" with me (I don't recall the exact words), but thanked me for telling him as it all made more sense now.

I want to say that I shot myself in the foot with showing him that online community as it is so unbelievably biased, cruel, and the very definition of ""misery loves company"" and honestly - most posts and responses sound like people struggling in abusive relationships that they attribute to ADHD and not just that their partner is an immature and abusive person with zero accountability. But alas, it is their space. I had hoped to also find perspective for myself there to better understand what my husband could be experiencing but it was just so hateful and unproductive. I'd maybe find the odd helpful and balanced comment now and again, but I was mostly shocked at how I'd see people absolutely disparaging and infantalizing their spouse or partner of multiple years.

In the end, my ex-husband told me he has no empathy for me. I found out he was disparaging me behind my back with his friends and degrading me with them using my nationality as the punching bag. He wrote everything off as me being ""too sensitive"" and having ""no sense of humour"". He blamed me saying that this was RSD (a term I assume he learned on that forum).

He told me that he wished I'd never told him about my diagnoses because it was just a way to ""control"" him. I told him that I just wanted to give him tools to work with and that I never meant to manipulate him and to please explain how I did that. He told me ""you didn't actively do it - but you passively did"". To this day, I still don't know.
He blamed me for not finishing his PhD, neglecting his friendships, said that my RSD was ""too much"" because I'd get upset over him leaving dirty dishes everywhere after I'd just cleaned up and would ask him to please respect me and my time and put his dishes away. 

He admitted to me after leaving me and trailing me along for months like he would come back if I did XYZ (including not discussing my hurt with him over what he did), that he has to lie to me to get things done, otherwise I get in his way. When I said this was manipulation, he disagreed and said it was because of my RSD that he had to do so. It was his lying that upset me and being ambushed later by mini lies due to his ""trickle truthing"" that put me on edge.

After he left, a person who claimed to be a supportive friend sexually assaulted me. He found out about it and quite frankly, he didn't care. As he told me to my crying face once that he has ""no empathy"" for me.


I'm so torn though. I know his comments were cruel, but I'm hesitant to dismiss them in case I can somehow learn or improve from them. He told me that he hated how I made him ""look in the mirror"" too often when I'd confront him on hypocritical or hurtful behaviour. 

I don't know who I can trust anymore. I want to be loved and to give love. I want healthy and mutual connection. But I'm scared to let anyone in because they think I'm nice, only to find out that I'm too chaotic, talk too fast, get too excited (he told me I was like an ""excited puppy"" when he'd come back after working elsewhere for a few weeks and he couldn't stand it). I want open communication and I feel like no matter what I do, people just don't say what's on their minds. I'm not a mindreader but I feel like it's expected of me.


Well, I ""look in the mirror"" a lot now and feel like it's hopeless. I know that ADHD is an explanation and not an excuse. I try so hard to keep it together and to communicate openly and hope for the same. I tried then to help him in his communication with me by brainstorming ways to avoid an RSD meltdown and when I look back - I honestly didn't really have them. I would break down after feeling unheard for months just to have him act like it was the first time I was saying anything - then have him mentally dismiss it as ""RSD"" and not legitimate. I often apologized to him, told him I loved him, asked for what we could do to improve and he'd never give me feedback. Only to later tell me that I owed him more ""respect"" and me speaking my mind was ""disrespectful"" (he was kind of obsessed with respect from everyone).

I spent (and still spend) a lot of time overthinking everything I do or say, revisiting conversations in my head to see where I went wrong. I try to find outside perspectives, read things, I'm medicated, etc. But it still feels hopeless.

Maybe I'm just too much for anyone? The way people look at me like I'm an alien when I participate in discussions with what I thought was relevant. Feeling trapped in my ideas and my head. I make an active effort to ask people about their day before spilling into babbling about mine to make sure they have a chance to talk and to show my interest in them as people (I read in that other forum that this is a big issue). I speak too fast and tell people to please, if I'm talking too much and they want to get a word in, cut me off and just start talking. I don't mind. I try not to do it, but it's not foolproof when I'm excited or my medication is wearing off in the evening. I feel like I'm too much. That I should just be better and control myself better and I hate that it's so hard. I don't want to make anyone feel unheard, disrespected, or like they have to manage my symptoms for me.

Which is why I feel hopeless. Like I can only prevent anyone from being hurt by me and my messed up brain if I just don't let them in to begin with. It's so hard to complete even tasks that interest me (e.g. presenting a scientific paper) because I have such a hard time filtering out relevant from irrelevant. So even in my passions, I'm not good enough. I feel so mentally lonely and honestly, having ADHD described as a cute and quirky disorder is so dishonest to the truth of what we face and makes me feel that much more alone.

2025-11-08 19:06:18;ADHD medication has made me talk less, but text more.;"I'm in my 20s, I've been on social media for basically half my life and texting has been an important part of my social life, but eventually, in my late teens I started answering texts slower and slower. Nowadays it sometimes takes me days to answer texts, it's not because I don't care, ""text paralysis"" is a common occurrence for many people with ADHD, it's not about forgetfulness or laziness, it's a struggle with executive dysfunction.

  
Last year I got diagnosed with ADHD, I've been told before that I may have it so it wasn't that much of a surprise, but eventually I accepted it and have started medication. Besides the fact that for the first time in my life executive dysfunction has COMPLETELY disappeared, I've also realized that my social interactions have changed a bit. I've been jokingly told by my friends that they can see if I've taken my meds or not based on how much I talk and what I say. I talk less and listen more, I'm not as impulsive, I don't say inappropriate things and I've also realized that when, let's say for example I don't take my meds for a while, one of the first things I do the day I take them is answer the emails and texts I've ignored that week.

I find that really interesting, of course it makes sense because they help with my executive dysfunction, but I don't see any similar experiences online.

2025-11-08 18:52:01;How to combat ADHD Boredom;"Hi everyone, looking for any helpful suggestions on my constant feeling of boredom. I am 29F, diagnosed with ADHD one year ago. I suspect in my childhood my ADHD went undiagnosed due to having a high IQ. I take methlyphenidate daily (when I remember). I think I am more the hyperactive subtype.

After work it's like nothing can entertain me enough. Watching TV, playing video games or reading just all bore me. It's like I want to do all of the things - have a veggie garden, do extra study, do painting, do crafting, flip furniture etc. I just don't feel hapy settling into that suburban lifestyle of coming home, cooking dinner, watching TV and going to bed (and rinse and repeat!).

I'm in a mood at the moment where I can't even listen to a song playing long enough that I just skip over to the next song while driving.

I want to be doing something drastic and exciting I feel like. Even in my career, I'm pretty bored and feel like I need something some stimulating, or some thing challenging that I can sink my teeth into.

2025-11-08 18:37:10;How do I talk to my sister about my ADHD?;"I've (32M) always looked up to my older sister (48F). Her and my mum have been role models to me growing up.

My sister is an amazing leading mental health nurse that specialises in those that hear voices (schizophrenia, psychosis, etc.) She has received awards for her pioneering work in her field and is a well-informed, well-educated individual.

She is anti-labels, anti-diagnoses, and anti-medication, believing that mental health is all natural responses to trauma.

I agree with her on a few things: the word 'disorder' needs to change, antidepressants are handed out too freely, and trauma plays a huge part in people struggling with mental illness and ADHD.

However, she doesn't believe that ADHD and ASD level 1 exists and believes they are social constructs that only group together mental health symptoms that are caused by trauma. She argues that there are no biological markers for them and the assessments are just anecdotal tickbox exercises that have no real science behind them.

I feel so dismissed by this. I think she is tarring ADHD and ASD with her understanding of mental health and they need to be separated. 

How do I explain to her that is it real and, while trauma does exacerbate struggles with ADHD, it stands alone with its own issues?

My recent diagnosis and subsequent medication essentially saved my life and means so much to me, but I worry that she just sees it as a sensationalised, cultish ideology that I have been brainwashed by.";r/ADHD;1;6;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1orma03/how_do_i_talk_to_my_sister_about_my_adhd/

2025-11-08 17:00:12;Titration Prep and finally believing I am allowed to say I have ADHD;"Hi everyone! I’m in the UK and finally about to stop being left to my own devices and start exploring medication (we have some big ol’ waiting lists to get diagnosed and another to get treatment). I am so relieved, the waiting/sitting around with diagnosis in my 30s has been quite a ride, when it was paired with being recently married and a new job, plus then relocating 2hr drive up the country. Just a bit more waiting for my medication to arrive for step one.

This post is primarily to process my thoughts, but also a seeking any tips. Naturally, it’s time to go back down the rabbit hole 🕳️ Probably time for a new notebook and life changing (for 5 mins) life overhaul. 

I was given a ‘Top 10 Tips’ document by my provider that recommends, amongst other sort of common sense things, no coffee plus one hour exercise a day. 

The coffee thing is annoying, but not end of the world. Anyone found decaf helps though? I am a Basic B and we are about to head into festive drink season.

Re: exercise. Thanks to overwhelm and tendency to go all in and burnout, I struggle keeping a fitness routine. Trawled this subreddit this morning and seen some great tips, like exercise clothes in the bathroom and using Just Dance, I have also downloaded Zumba. I’m pretty sedentary so would be grateful for any tips on how to build a walk/dedicated movement into my day. I get so chained to my desk when I work from home. I’ve changed my Apple Watch face to one that shows exercise time as well as step count (and a quick button for Find My Devices!), so hopeful for that.

Healthy eating, I have signed up to a veg and fruit box. First one has arrived with lots of exciting veg and fruit. Hoping they don’t just rot in the fridge 😂 Building a meal plan around them this weekend.

2025-11-08 16:59:57;That “you people can’t do anything” tweet is lowkey ableist and ADHD ppl laughing like they’re in on the joke when they are the joke is really “pick me”ish and cringe;"Lately I’ve been seeing TikToks about that infamous “you people can’t do anything” tweet all over my feed. The comment sections are full of people calling it the funniest tweet ever and making fun of the initial tweet that resulted in the reply, where op was literally just talking about having a hard time with ADHD and Halloween.

I already many people don’t take ADHD seriously and think it’s low-key fake/over-diagnosed and shouldn’t actually impact your life that much. But what’s really weird is seeing people with ADHD downplay how it affects others just to score points. Like, why are you siding with the people who mock you?

I get that everyone’s sense of humor and motivation is different. Some people really do run on spite or sarcasm. But the way that tweet’s been treated rn like it’s some universal “get your act together” moment is just weird and disrespectful. And it’s especially weird when people go out of their way to say, “I have ADHD, but that’s pathetic” or “I’ve never struggled with that,” like their experience is the rule.

It’s not edgy or empowering to imply that people with more disabling symptoms are lazy or weird because they “can’t do anything.” That’s not motivation or “being real”; that’s ignorance dressed up as humor. I’ve literally seen people saying “victim mentality,” “all y’all do is complain,” or “here y’all go again” when others are just describing their actual lives.

And before anyone jumps in with, “People made the tweet ableist when it wasn’t,” ask yourself why you think the original tweet was’t able in the first place, ADHD affects almost every part of someone’s life but magically skips over holidays. For a lot of us, things like ADHD, autism, or other neurodivergences make everything harder, not just big stuff like work or school, but the most basic parts of daily life. Even simple self-care can be exhausting. Executive dysfunction doesn’t just turn off for fun things like Halloween costumes. If planning, decision-making, and follow-through are the main struggles of ADHD (which they are), then obviously that kind of thing is going to be affected.

Also, there needs to be a real conversation about why just mentioning ADHD triggers people so badly. That’s honestly one of the most annoying parts. People act like OP was forcing everyone into some awareness campaign about ADHD and Halloween, when all they did was tweet on their own account, probably talking to her mutuals who get it. There’s this weird knee-jerk reaction to be annoyed by anyone even mentioning ADHD. I’ve seen people purposely avoid saying it, like, “I just have trouble focusing” instead of “I have ADHD”  because they don’t want to deal with people calling them lazy or making excuses. It’s insane. It’s a whole fucking disorder, not a personality quirk.

And every time someone online talks about how something simple feels impossible, the response is always mockery or that fake “tough love” bullshit. That’s why this tweet hit a nerve. It reinforces the idea that if your disability actually disables you, you’re the punchline and if you’re honest about it, you’re “complaining.”

Honestly, watching people brag about how that tweet “motivated” them is just pick-me energy. Like, congrats on proving you’re not “one of those people,” I guess.

2025-11-08 16:48:55;Is family medicine doctor turned ADHD specialist a red flag;"I was recently diagnosed by a family medicine doctor who had their practice dedicated to adhd for the past few decades. I had a couple visits for diagnosis and they prescribed medication. Reflecting on what the doctor told me, I’m starting to question their expertise. I asked whether methylphenidate ER would affect my sleep and they said no, which is clearly not true. Adding to my concern, I have a few other health conditions that make things complicated, which of course I let the doctor know. However, I felt like the doctor was not taking these into consideration when prescribing, because when I asked about their logic, they didn’t have good explanation beyond “lets try methylphenidate first because amphetamine tend to spike anxiety”.

It worries me that this doctor doesn’t have formal psychiatric training, despite the 20+ years of only seeing adhd patients. I’ve seen a fantastic psychiatrist before I moved away and I know what a good psychiatrist look like.  And I’ve had my fair share of encounters with bad psychiatrists, for lack of knowledge not good will, had sent my life to hell with meds.

I’ve just picked up my meds and haven’t taken anything yet. I wonder if this is just me overthinking and my anxiety talking. Part of my feels like a fraud and afraid that I do not actually have adhd; part of me worries my body may freak out with the meds and the doctor is not competent enough to help me through that.

Now that I’ve had some time to think about it, I am so frustrated and disappointed.  I thought for sure that I’d be able to get some answers, but instead I got a lot of dismissive responses.

I have read posts here where people really cannot function, and I definitely don’t have that.

I have held down a good job that requires me to be organized and I am capable of handling it, but that because I have years and years of tricks, workarounds, etc. that I use.  Once I started going thru menopause, it has become harder & harder to function.

I had hoped that I would get some answers and a path forward, whether that meant medication or a more detailed path for therapy, but instead I was basically told that it wasn’t a big deal.  

I am curious about others’ experiences with the testing because I don’t feel like it touched on a lot of the things I have issues with - getting started on tasks, being able to focus for any extended period of time, impulsive spending, completely messy home.  

The doctor also diagnosed me as having OCD, which I already knew and had already discussed with both him & my regular therapist, but he mentioned several times that I had a fear of harming others which is 1000% something that is untrue.  I have absolutely no fear that I’m going to hurt someone else or myself.  I have no idea where this even came from.  It’s making me think that he has me confused with someone else.";r/adhdwomen;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ori1ad/frustrated_newly_diagnosed/

2025-11-08 13:38:16;Building a small ADHD community in Pune (or online all india or abroad) — to connect, share solutions, and actually get things done;"Hey everyone,
I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how hard it is to deal with ADHD — not just the symptoms, but the isolation, the constant starting and stopping, the confusion, the exhaustion of trying to “fix” yourself.

Medication helps some people, but not all. Therapy is great but often expensive or inaccessible. What we don’t have enough of is community — a space to share real struggles and practical systems that work for us, not just textbook advice.

So I’m starting this initiative — a small, grounded ADHD community based in Pune (with an online option too). The idea:

Meet (virtually or in person) to talk openly without judgment.

Share methods that actually helped you — productivity, focus, routines, emotional regulation.

Keep each other accountable to get things done.

Maybe even collaborate on small projects, build habits, or just support each other through the fog.

No fake positivity, no “just try harder” talk. Real people, real experiences, trying to make life smoother and more meaningful.

If this resonates with you — whether you’ve been diagnosed or just strongly relate — drop a comment or DM me. Let’s create something that helps us function and grow together, beyond medication or theory.

This is not just for everyone but also for my own success I've struggled many years and know lot of things about it I also know this is one of the best way to overcome the symptoms according to lot of adhders who became successful and also how adhd brain works, my genuine message is we should try this and I strongly believe it will bring a strong change in our lives for everyone's success and yours too I hope we connect.

2025-11-08 13:23:34;Would this bother you? (dating);"I went on a date with a guy I met on hinge. We were speaking online for 3 weeks prior to meeting. One of my hinge prompts is related to ADHD - he responded to it mentioning that he has autism. Over the 3 weeks we spoke a lot about adhd/autism, sometimes in a joking way, but we seemed to bond over the fact we’re both audhd (or so I thought..). 

Anyway we meet and it’s all going so well right up until the last 10 minutes. I had an exam the next day so he asked me what time it finished - told him i’ll be finishing later than everyone else because I have extra time due to my adhd. He’s like - “Wait, do you actually have adhd”??? “Oh shit you’re like actually autistic?” I’m like “Yes, did you think I was joking this whole time”? he’s like “Yeah, everyone jokes about being autistic lol” I then went on to say how I thought he was being serious this whole time. And then he’s like “I know I don’t have adhd because I’m not hyperactive all the time” I was like, uhh, babes I’m the least hyperactive person and my adhd is debilitating, that’s not the only symptom. 💀 

Anyway, I’m kind of upset that he was making a joke out of it the entire time. Even though I was diagnosed 3 years ago, I still struggle all the time with post diagnosis grief, and the fact it’s so hard for me to ‘fit’ into society by masking every damn day and then burning out because I’m high functioning. Would this bother you? Or am I being dramatic?  ";r/ADHD;310;36;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1orh57g/would_this_bother_you_dating/

I am 28 recently was diagnosed with ADHD and have started trying meds. I always thought there was a good chance I had ADHD just from how I was a kid. 

However, recently I noticed a lot of ADHD symptoms amplifying themselves. Even with taking the low dose of medication. 

The one symptom that’s been the most noticeable that I didn’t notice before is I will literally forget what I’m saying mid sentence and I have to stop and think hard about what I was just trying to say. 

Now in the last bit I will say I have had a lot more stress and I am working a full time and part time job, so I’m probably quite tired. However, I do get a good nights sleep. But I’m also wondering if birth control would play a factor in it. I had been on the pill for about 10 years and then went off in April and got an IUD in may. I believe the IUD hormones are much more consistent than the pill. 

But idk I’m just trying to figure out why all of a sudden it seems to have gotten so much worse 😅 ";r/adhdwomen;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1orfwn5/birth_control_and_adhd/

This is my first really close to me death since my diagnosis and ADHD.. is this normal?  Should add . I lost 4 grandparents in my life. 8 didn't get to say good bye or anything. And I know that's just how it is sometimes. I don't think I have ever properly grieved.. I don't know... I've never been to visit any of the graves. Not even sure if 1 has a headstone.

For some context, i was diagnosed with ADHD when i was 6 years old. 

Its been a struggle most of my life, im sure many of you here understand. But one thing i am really struggling with is controlling my tone.

Sometimes when im talking to people i  have been told my tone can come off quite rude, but the issue is i honestly dont hear it myself.

This causes great stress and issues in my life as obviously arguments arise not because of what i say, but how i say it.

Sometimes i feel like i answer and i sound mad or angry but that is not at all how im feeling. I'm unsure why i am like this. I would love to be able to go to therapy when i can afford it but for now im going to try to help myself 

Im hoping some of you here also struggle with regulating tone, i feel awful because my husband bears the brunt of it and i want to change because its not fair.

2025-11-08 09:25:16;My Sister Needs Help;"TW: Suicide and SH mention 

Like my title says, my (f 26) sister (f 15) needs help and I don't know what I need to do to help. 

She got diagnosed with inattentive ADHD just before she entered high school. Its a really good school she boards at and it seems like they bend over backwards for her. She gets extra time on tests, they let her bring her notes from class to use on tests and quizzes, and shes allowed to make them up if she doesnt do good on them. She often doesnt take notes or forgets them altogether and skips out on tutoring.

Outside of school, shes been having a really bad attitude problem with her dorm mothers. Her attitude wasnt bad in the beginning, but lately the mother's have been having to get on her more and more about hygiene and keeping her room clean on top of reminding her about doing her homework. There are about 50 girls in this dorm, I personally feel like the few mothers they have are spread thin. Plus, this is high school. Not an elementary. They shouldn't have to get on her about basic things like hygiene.

This most recent incident with her is she started throwing things around in her room, saying shes gonna off herself, cutting up her arms. It got her a medical leave from school. We had a heart to heart after I picked her up. She says she loves the school and everyone's nice. I told her if she wants to stay she needs to really work for it now and shes lucky shes only on medical leave. 

Im sorry for the ramble and vent, Im just so lost on what to do. Im always there to support her but she just doesnt seem to want any help or to get better. Anything she says is a contradiction to her actions and Im scared our family's patience is up. If anyone has advice, if this was you in school, please comment.

I was so excited for this appointment because I’ve been struggling lately and hoping I might get a diagnosis and helpful advice. 

About half way through the appointment I get a phone call from my friend’s kids school. Immediately I realized “oh my god, it’s Wednesday, I’m supposed to pick up this kid on Wednesday” I’ve been doing this every week since the start of the school year and for some reason, this day, I just completely blanked and forgot. So I had to end the appointment early and just completely lost it. I was crying hysterically and felt like such and idiot and a failure as I rushed over to school. I picked her up and it was all fine in the grand scheme of things. 

My question comes in what followed. For the rest of the day I had such a hard time finding the energy to do anything. I had some errands to run and before and after each I just sat in my car unable to bring myself to actually go in or drive off.

Unfortunately, I’m now on my final attempt for my Civil and Criminal Litigation MCQ papers. I was supposed to have been called to the Bar two years ago, but I kept delaying and failing my exams after two previous attempts.

Throughout my degree and Bar studies, I’ve always struggled more than my peers. No matter how hard I tried, it always felt like there was something wrong with me.. like my brain just couldn’t keep up, I couldn’t focus, I procrastinated endlessly, and every attempt to fix myself just made me feel more defeated.

It wasn’t until recently, after coming back to my home country, that I decided to see a psychiatrist. That’s when I finally got diagnosed with ADHD and I am currently on medication which has helped a lot with executive dysfunction. 

Honestly, this was both a relief and a heartbreak. A relief because I finally have an explanation for years of confusion, self-blame, and frustration. But also a heartbreak because I can’t help but think of how different things might have been if I’d known earlier, and also how maybe I shouldn’t have chosen this career path and it makes me wonder whether I am pushing myself towards something that might not suit me… 

If anyone has been through something similar, especially those who are working lawyers or are currently in law school, I’d really love to hear your experiences or any advice on how you all have coped.

So my psychiatrist prescribed me Vyvanse, but insurance said they won't cover it unless i try other medications first, so eventually I was able to get adderall and try that first. it's extended release 20mg. i took it for the first time yesterday and felt... nothing? i wasn't expecting to get a burst of energy or anything like that but i still felt like completing a task was taking all of my life energy. if anything i started feeling more anxious and upset that the medicine wasn't helping. 

i dont know if it takes time to work or what but i started feeling really emotional and even cried in front of my parents which i never do. I dont know if it was because of the medicine or i was just having a bad day because im failing school (bc i can't get any work done) and grieving. and my parents dont know that im on any medications bc they dont believe in mental illness. i also take prozac 20 mg that i take every day at 10 pm since it doesn't affect my sleep. i've been taking it for about a month. last night tho i had trouble sleeping so maybe that was cuz the adderall. i have a hard time waking up in the mornings so i took the adderall at 1 pm yesterday and 12 pm today. 

today my body was shaking, i was dizzy and i was breaking out into a cold sweat. i was able to get some chores done because family is visiting but i dont know if it was because i was on a time crunch and my mom was yelling at me or if the medicine helped me complete the chores. still can't get myself to get any school work done. i'm honestly confused and wondering if anyone had a similar experience. my next apt with my psychiatrist is on the 13th i think so ill talk to her about it then.";r/ADHD;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oraasy/started_adderall_for_the_first_timehelp/

So I was someone who was diagnosed with ADD (no longer used term, now all is under ADHD) as a child, but my mother was very against medication and since I did well in school she never saw a reason to get care, despite the obvious signs in behavior. Not really the point though.

Because of this I’ve grown a nervous energy around beginning medications for ADHD (along with other reasons like other medications but that’s been discussed with the doctor there’s no issues). I don’t really have a good reason(?) to be nervous but I’ve heard so many bad stories around people starting or taking adderall and it ends up really messing them up.

Well, I don't know what happened this week but I dropped the ball in several minor situations s and one BIG situation. Also, I'm interviewing for a promotion early next week and think that that went out the window. So, obviously I have to reevaluate how I approach things.

I guess my question is- for those of you in fast-paced jobs with lots of moving parts and lots of details to remember, what are your tricks to keep it all together? From a lifetime of having to mask and use tricks to do what I need to do, I feel like I need new tricks since this is new territory for me and I'm faltering.

Hope this all makes sense and has enough context. Thanks in advance.";r/adhdwomen;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1or9g0k/in_need_of_some_advice_and_maybe_some_comfort/

I just got diagnosed with ADHD after struggling with energy and focusing my whole life and not truly understanding why. I have suspected ADHD since I was about 12 (my father has it) but it has flew under the radar for my family because I always got good grades in school. But I have been struggling immensely recently and decided to finally seek a diagnosis. My doctor prescribed me Vyvanse and I have just recently began taking it and I am already over the moon! I can’t believe that I really could have been helped all along. I feel as though since starting the medication I have felt more productive than ever before.

2025-11-08 06:12:39;New here and need advice!;Hi all, I just discovered this sub and was hoping to get some advice. I’m a 49 year old woman and I’ve really been struggling the last 3 years. I have a son who was diagnosed with adhd as a child so I’m familiar with it and am now seriously wondering if I may have it as well. I’ve been doing research and I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that are just now seriously beginning to impact my life and business. Mainly just being mentally paralyzed not being able to concentrate and do the things I need to do. I’ve always been crazy busy with working multiple businesses at once while raising 3 kids and managing a household. I actually think adhd helped me do all that at once. Now the kids are grown and gone and I am down to 1 business which I am starting over with in a new state at a much smaller pace. Without all the responsibilities now, I am just at a standstill and get myself to do what I want to. I’ve also lost pleasure in so many activities and hobbies. I was diagnosed with depression 28 years ago and have been on Wellbutrin since then which has always worked. I don’t have an official adhd diagnosis but do you think I should get one? I’m not sure I wasn’t to do it with my primary care doctor and was thinking of trying one of these online clinics that specializes in adhd. Has anyone had good luck with that? I’m so overwhelmed and sick of feeling the way I do and I’ve got to change something. TIA;r/adhdwomen;0;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1or7yh0/new_here_and_need_advice/
2025-11-08 05:23:40;Starting Vyvanse;"Hello!

40 year old, diagnosed with combination ADHD 4 months ago. Was started on a low dose of dex (5mg - 3 x per day). Tolerated it well and it made a difference although quite minor.

Had my follow up appointment with my psych. and we agreed because I had no issues, to try 40mg Vyvanse (dex as a top up if needed).

I tried Vyvanse for four days because stopping (not long enough, I know). I’m a very talkative person, and I feel like Vyvanse made me a mute 🤣🤣 Being a yapper is a part of who I am. 

I went to work on the fourth day and found that because I felt a little odd from feeling so quiet, I couldn’t really focus and become productive. 

I emailed the psych who said to give it a few more days, so I’ve started again, and am back on day 2.

My question is, has anyone experienced the same, but after giving it a week or two to adjust, maybe didn’t feel quite so “quiet”? 

I do remember taking a little bit to adjust to the low dose Dex, and then all was good.

I’m not looking for my head to be busy again, just maybe not feeling so relaxed to the point I’m not bothering to talk - I like that part of me.

Thanks!";r/adhdwomen;2;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1or6qoo/starting_vyvanse/
2025-11-08 05:16:55;The feeling of lost time;"I’m 40 years old. Was diagnosed a couple of months ago, though my therapist was pretty convinced a few years ago that I had ADHD but I never got to getting diagnosed ‘officially’ until much more recently.

Last week I went to my doctor, diagnosis in hand, and got put on Vyvanse. Finally, Sunday, I took my first pill and… it was like the radio station in my brain that had always been fuzzy and distorted suddenly found the exact frequency.

This week I’ve been crushing it at my job, a high pressure and high stress role that I’d spent the last few years burning myself out just to get to ‘okay’. My house is clean, chores and errands I’d been putting off for years got done, and I feel like I’m the truest version of myself possible. 

And man. I wish I’d done this sooner. I wish my parents had realized when I went from a straight A student in high school to almost failing out of university that there was something else beyond me being ‘lazy’.

So much of the decisions I’ve made and ways I’ve lived my life are because of my ADHD. And I think about who I could have been and who I am and I can’t help but feeling I’ve wasted so much time being okay with not being okay.

My life isn’t awful, but I wonder what it could be and could have been if I’d done this sooner. And I can’t help but get caught up in ‘what could have beens’. But I can’t change the past. I can’t redo the last 40 years. I just wish I could accept that.";r/ADHD;22;10;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1or6kdl/the_feeling_of_lost_time/
2025-11-08 04:37:15;Some things I cant' do because o ADHD(?);"Some specialists have diagnosed me with ADHD, and I believe they might be right. However, a few others disagreed. I think it’s better to talk to people who actually struggle with this every day — to see if I’m really one of you, a fellow “ADHD enjoyer.”

The things I describe below have been with me my whole life. They don’t depend on my mood, depression, or how intellectually demanding the work is.

1. When I face a big task — even if it’s conceptually simple — I just can’t seem to put my mind together. After about 30 minutes, my brain starts to overload, and it feels like my consciousness fills with white noise.
2. I get distracted very easily while watching lectures or movies, reading books. The denser the information, the higher the chance I zone out.
3. Starting anything is incredibly hard for me — planning my day, beginning work, or even small tasks. And when I finally start, I rarely feel any sense of progress.
4. Sometimes I can’t physically make myself do things. It’s like I hate doing *anything*.
5. I’m not a good worker. I procrastinate most of the time, and even small tasks that require extra effort feel unbearable.
6. On top of that, I’m terrible at making life decisions. I often go back and forth between several options and still end up doubting my choice afterward.

But sometimes my mind ""clears"" or I don't know what happens and in these short interval I can read the book easily or do something big easily. Are these characteristics usual in ADHD community? ";r/ADHD;3;22;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1or5jy5/some_things_i_cant_do_because_o_adhd/
2025-11-08 04:10:16;Is this normal for a psychiatrist to be like this?;"Long read ahead, I apologize in advance. I just don’t know what to do or think. Trying to process it and see if I went wrong anywhere. 

For context: I’m a 31 year old female, just got diagnosed with inattentive adhd about 3 years ago, but I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder for over 15 years. My last psychiatrist did not want to write me a script for stimulants since I have my MMJ card. I knew a few people who have their card also but are able to get their stimulants filled no problem. So I opted for a different doctor.

This is where it gets insane.

The only time I have ever talked to him face to face was a Zoom call that lasted 15 minutes. He had to do another test for adhd (which was fine, considering I was a new patient). He had no problem writing me a script for Adderall. Everything was good at first. But I soon learned that I would have to text him (only communication now) about 5-7 days before I ran out.

First few months, maybe went 1-2 days without every 2-3 months. He listened and let me either increase it or decrease it until I found the right dosage.

About a year ago I wanted to add either a mood stabilizer or antidepressant. He suggested Lamictal since a mood stabilizer is often more beneficial than an antidepressant. Worked great and I’m still currently on it.

July of last year is when I started having problems. I would message him for my refills the 5-7 days beforehand. He would reply “okay not a problem, I’ll send it in a few days.” Okay, cool. NOPE. Waited about 4-5 days without until he finally would answer and send it, every month. At this point, I tried calling his “office”, but it would pop up his number and go straight to voicemail so I gave up doing that.

I got different insurance that wouldn’t cover my stimulant, and at this point we had switched from Adderall to Vyvanse. My insurance would not cover it without a “C2 Stimulant Form” and chart notes. I told him this, but he acted extremely confused by the process. I told him “that’s what the insurance company told me.” He said “I usually wait until they deny it and send it to me, then I appeal it.” SIR I cannot wait what would be WEEKS without my medication. I understand it’s a stimulant and it’s a controlled substance, but this is for my mental wellbeing and I don’t play when it comes to my mental health.

That was 4 months ago. Every single month I would tell him to send the C2 form, and every single month I’d have to wait for him to even send it to the pharmacy. The pharmacy tells me it’s in “prior authorization”. Call the insurance, same thing, waiting for the C2 form.

I finally had enough. I messaged him for 5 days straight asking to just send the medication in and I’ll pay the $177 dollars for a month supply. For 5 days there was no answer. So finally I said “if I do not hear anything back by the end of today, I will be forced to find a different doctor.” Wouldn’t you know, he replied back ONE MINUTE later.

I couldn’t just sit and take it, and I went off on him. I said “there is no reason why this is an issue. I have told you for months what the insurance company needed and you have not done that. I understand that insurance companies are picky, but surely I am not the only patient who you write prescriptions for stimulants for.” He really said “I’m sorry you feel that way. I can send a referral for you to receive the care you believe you need.” I replied back “a psychiatrist should know what to send, when to send it, and what process it is. There is absolutely no reason why every month I have to go days without my medication. A controlled substance that has some serious side effects. Without it I am in emotional distress. Every single month I am in distress for 4-7 days. And yes I do want a referral for a doctor who knows what they’re doing.”

Is it really that difficult to send a prescription to the pharmacy on time? I understand every once in a while it’s a day or 2 late, but every single month? Is it that difficult to fill out and send a C2 stimulant form to the insurance? Would this be considered medical negligence? I’m just tired of doing this every single month, and being so anxious and having panic attacks for days while waiting for my medicine.

Am I doing something wrong? Is me going off on him unreasonable? Am I being too much over my medication? I just worry about it being a controlled substance that this could be viewed the wrong way. I do not take more than what is prescribed, I take it as prescribed.

TLDR; My psychiatrist isn’t sending my medication to the pharmacy on time, and isn’t sending the insurance information that they need to approve it. Is it that hard to send a C2 stimulant form to the insurance? Is it that hard to listen to a patient when they are in distress? Am I doing something wrong?

If you got this far, I appreciate it. I just needed to get it out and rant to people who “get it” and understand. ";r/adhd_anxiety;8;13;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1or4v4n/is_this_normal_for_a_psychiatrist_to_be_like_this/

2025-11-08 03:20:57;Failed 2 times horribly, yet I CANNOT EVEN GET UP TO STUDY;"I have never changed, i still feel that I havent grown out of the pre-teen phase. IM 21 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!

Past year(s), its always has been - i will do this/change my life after xyz (say, after bathing, or eating or after making notes of some useful videos - i would ""change my life""). Everytime it's the same excuse, everytime i have tried to work, even when i force myself to even get up. I couldn't, some excuse or the other. 

I used to look at the clock - ticking by, feeling guilty and yet i couldn't even get up from my bed (so i drowned myself in those addictions or daydreaming again). 

 I CANNOT afford to, when i got a second chance i told myself ""i would lock in"", i have to LOCK IN. Yet it's the same, same mistakes, same thought process, same efforts, same results. All my life is just one disappointment after the another. 

I'm already lagging behind 2 years from my peers. I want to blame it all on THE PESKY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES in my nation. If I was diagnosed the first time I went in, if i could have received help earlier. If i would have - then i might have not failed. I don't know man, i don't know. 

After 10 months of constant struggle, 5 psychs (4 psychs whom i exclusively went for ADHD - confirmed that it's Adult ADHD, one said it's MDD along with executive dysfunction). 

Its been 10 days when I have started taking meds (methyphenidate inspiral 10mg twice a day) but I still feel the same. I cannot take it anymore man. I sleep the entire day, or just indulge in addictions/screens until I feel fatigued so I can sleep again. I hate this.

Even after failing horribly, i don't feel anything on the surface while I'm screaming and whimping under.i cannot even pick up books, even if I do i cannot focus on anything for more than 10-20 seconds. And again the amount of time I have left is even less than scarce. (I would have to put in atleast 10 hrs+ to even have a shot at passing).

I responded by giving some organization tips as someone who also has ADHD. We then exchanged jokes about how common ADHD is in our profession. Totally nice.

Some other redditor then piped up to say that ADHD is a spectrum and that any symptom at all could be attributed to it. That a symptom and its opposite are both called ADHD. I responded to say that is objectively false, and that while misinformed people on the internet might attribute everything to ADHD, clinicians certainly don’t. They responded to say that if I “read about ADHD” I would see that it’s symptoms are basically anything and that “it’s difficult to diagnose imo.” I then responded again saying that this is also objectively false and that they should familiarize themselves with the DSM-5’s diagnostic criteria for ADHD rather than trying to undermine the mental health diagnosis of a person they’ve never met. They just responded again saying that’s not what they did and calling me a clown.

I had ADHD since childhood. I often lost things and made a lot of mistakes, but I was never officially diagnosed. 

Still, I did quite well academically through high school and dreamed of becoming someone extraordinary.

But once I entered university, I lost all motivation because nobody told me what to do. On top of that, I failed in my first relationship because I was too into him and that experience left me emotionally scarred.

After that, I realized I probably had ADHD. I got diagnosed and tried medication, but it didn’t help much. In my country, Adderall and Vyvanse are both illegal so Concerta and Atomoxetine were my only options. I struggled with executive dysfunction, binge eating, and obsessive thoughts.

Even so, I somehow managed to graduate from college. Then I joined a tough company, made a lot of mistakes, got scolded by my boss, felt defeated, and eventually quit. 

After that, I gained a lot of weight and have only been working part-time jobs for the past two years.

So far, I’ve loved adderal. I love doing homework again, I’m able to get out of the house, I’m able to clean, etc.

The issue I’m coming to you guys with is that I’ve always had this problem of my brain talking way too much. When I started anti-depressants a few years ago, that started to die down. However, I’ve noticed these last few days that my brain just doesn’t shut up. Of course, brains aren’t meant to be quiet since you’re always thinking about something, but it’s seriously running its own little podcast up there. I’ve been worried that my friends think I’m annoying since I’ve started talking a lot more since starting adderall, but genuinely I think I’m just annoyed with all the sound I’ve caused myself. This much energy has its pros and cons, but it’s almost more distracting than the ADHD itself.

For reference, I wanted to be tested for ADHD or ADDD because I’ve always struggled with…for lack of a better phrase…being lazy and forgetful. It was starting to be a real problem in my personal life as someone also diagnosed with chronic depression. I have also since realized that adderall doesn’t make you get up and want to do chores, it just helps you focus. You have to choose to focus on chores if adderall is going to help you. So the fact that my brain is riddled with other thoughts that I choose to focus on instead, some problems are being left unsolved. I do have trouble sleeping, but that’s by choice not necessarily the medication.

2025-11-07 22:31:23;Finally got formally diagnosed with ADHD — medication costs $300 🙃;"I was diagnosed with ADHD at 7 years old and was recently formally diagnosed again by my psychiatrist and prescribed Vyvanse.

I got diagnosed with ADHD about three years ago (I’m 31), and it was a huge eye opener for me. I’ve been working really hard on routines that work with my ADHD, setting up spaces in my apartment that are more functional, etc. and it’s been amazing…. but there are still things I’m struggling to adapt that I just can’t seem to get consistent with. I was going to therapy for about a year and that was very helpful, but I had to take a pause there for some financial reasons, though I do intend to go back as soon as I can reasonably afford it again. 

As I’m sure so many of you can relate, I feel really trapped in this cycle with food and fitness where I do great for a couple of days and feel amazing, and then one moment of emotional dysregulation shoves me right back into bad habits that I feel very powerless to control. Every time I look for tips on this… I feel like I’m getting either a neurotypical perspective of “just have more discipline” or “just stick to a routine” and I feel like I’ve tried that a million different times. 

So in the spirit of being an ADHD girl who loves lists……. here are the things I’ve noticed for me that are barriers, and I’m wondering what you’ve all done to overcome similar things, or what practical routines / visual cues / strategies are working for you. 

For Food: 
- I don’t really love to cook, so all parts of that feel so overwhelming to me. What do you mean I have to plan a recipe and then buy the stuff and then actively take time to cook it (which in my mind always feels like hours)…. I’ll just doordash instead. 
- “Healthy” eating can sometimes feel very restrictive to me. I struggle with healthy food feeling boring so when I am on a healthy eating kick or trying to lose weight, I find myself feeling like I’m missing out or losing something, which just leads to me feeling worse about it
- I forget to eat, which I know is common with ADHD, but when the day ends and my meds wear off…. suddenly I’m in a adderall crash, my emotions are all over the place, and the first sign of hunger = fuck it I have to order food. But because I haven’t eaten all day and i’m feeling bad, I over order, I over eat, I choose things that are objectively unhealthy for me, and then I shame spiral after it.

For Fitness: 
- Prior to this past year, I was pretty much completely sedentary except for the fact that I live in a walkable city. A string of bad things combined with covid left me indoors for a long time, and now I work from home. In February I forced myself over the hurdle of being afraid of the gym for the first time in my life and started going. I’m taking that as a huge win, but even still…. I struggle with consistency
- I go to a fitness class twice a week, but when I’m feeling overwhelmed or struggling with time, I get the sudden urge to cancel and often find myself acting on it. 
- I feel like I can’t commit to a good schedule or even be semi consistent, so what’s ended up happening is in a month I’ll have one week where I’m amazing and crushing it, one week where I skip entirely, one week where I go once, etc. and it’s just limiting my ability to see real improvements in myself
- i feel very trapped my fear when it comes to trying new things. I’m not sure if this is an ADHD thing or a me thing, but I’m curious if anyone else feels this way? I often think about picking up something like running, or going to a yoga class, etc., but the barriers to that feel so incredibly, overwhelmingly high. and at the end of the day, I’m always worried about my interactions with other people. i really find myself struggling with being out of the house, being social, etc., but that’s just not what I want for myself.  

Any advice would be so helpful here. I know these things are not unique to my experience with ADHD, but I feel like I’m really playing catch up being diagnosed later in life, and I don’t want to miss out on more time. 

Also… one last side question because I’ve seen it raised in conversations around regulation and eating, if anyone has experience with somatic therapy or incorporating any similar practices and found it beneficial, I’d love to know! I’ve been researching, but just curious. 

tl;dr: struggling with consistency, finding enjoyment in things my brain perceives as chores (like cooking), and always feel very trapped by the cycle of searching for motivation for something, failing, and then being impulsive. any advice welcome!";r/adhdwomen;6;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oqv8s3/how_are_we_managing_our_diets_and_exercise_im/
2025-11-07 21:48:45;No clue if this is a symptom, but it's putting a strain on my relationship. :(;"Just some background, I already am diagnosed with OCD and am on a 150mg of Zoloft. 

I have the hardest time remembering to do simple tasks. This has been causing a lot of irritation and strain in my relationship. I have to constantly remind my husband that I am not doing it maliciously, but he understandably is very frustrated.

He works from home and does the majority of chores and cleaning up around the house. I am a teacher, so when I get home I am usually exhausted but I cook dinner and try to clean.

My husband is also diagnosed ADD and he has been medicated for a long time. He is always very task-oriented and has no problem getting things done.

  
Things I struggle with

\-Remembering to put dishes away

\-Remembering small tasks he has asked me to do

\-Forgetting dates constantly

\-Setting alarms and them forgetting about them

\-Cleaning up after myself ie. puttting a dish away after I've used it

\-Hanging up towels after giving my daughter a bath and putting her to bed

  
It almost feels like I'm blind to it. It's so frustrating for me and him.

2025-11-07 21:16:14;Have I been diagnosed?;"So I had my ADHD assessment and he has put me on the Titration waiting list, also said I fit the criteria for ADHD etc. Is this a formal diagnosis then? I don't know if I needed him to flat out say 'you have inattentive ADHD' to actually believe it.

Also, is there a way to just get medication as a sample early while on the waiting list? All along I've really just wanted to try it and see how it affects me, if it isn't good for me then I don't even want to have it long term and will find other ways to cope.

2025-11-07 21:14:07;Not so supportive husband;I was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager but nothing was ever done about it. I’ve never wanted medication because I had a really bad experience with an antidepressant trial and it completely turned me off from all psych meds. I recently decided I might finally want to try something so I started seeing a new psychiatrist and she told me that in order to prescribe me something I need to take the test her office gives to verify a diagnosis. I took it a couple of weeks ago and have my appointment today to go over it and it’s been making me anxious. My husband has always seemed supportive of me and my issues so last night I was telling him about my anxiety and that I’m afraid she’s going to tell me that it’s all a lie and I don’t actually have ADHD which to me would mean I just suck as a person. His response was that it sounds like I just want the diagnosis so that I can use it as an excuse to act l the way I do. I was shocked speechless and am not sure how I kept myself from bursting into tears. With one careless response it’s like he somehow validated all my worst thoughts. I’m lazy and terrible and just looking for an excuse to suck as a human and get away with it. He really thinks that little of me and he doesn’t support me at all.

2025-11-07 20:22:09;Your experience with adhd;"I got my diagnosis yesterday and am now having some thoughts about it. I'm not asking for medical advice, I'm just trying to scope out other peoples experiences as I don't know a lot about this diagnoses nor any people who have it. 

Basically, I was diagnosed with low adhd. What I understand this means is that it doesn't affect me in a major way or disable me majorly in my day to day life. Why I mainly got the diagnosis was because I, as well as my psychologist, believed that it hindered my education to the point where it needs to be addressed. (I am an adult but, because of my adhd, could not finish school as a minor). 

Now, what I'm thinking about is that I think my life does get very affected by this diagnosis. I haven't thought about it that much before, not before my psychologist did affirm that my issues that I spoke to her about probably was adhd. But these problems do seem to be more major than minor. 

What I would like to ask is if someone with a higher adhd diagnosis could perhaps explain their level of disability in their day to day life.

I won't use this to diagnose myself, I just want to learn more and see if I do relate to anything in which case I will speak about it with my psychologist. 

Thanks, from someone trying to learn!

He also uses a shit ton of shampoo. Half my bottle was gone yesterday after his one shower. I asked him, casually, if he thinks his long showers are OCD or ADHD related. He said no, and explained that he likes long showers because they ""help him move time forward"".  I asked him to explain what that means, and he tried for a second and gave up. I didn't push it, I don't want to overwhelm him.

2025-11-07 19:05:45;"Coping with ""Justice Sensitivity?""";"Hi again everyone. 

I'm an adult newly diagnosed with ADHD. And, I'm writing about one issue that I've noticed which is apparently a symptom of ADHD: ""justice sensitivity."" 

It's something that I think can be a strength at time, but is also definitely a weakness as well that creates issues in my life. 

On one hand, it gives me a strong desire to be fair, and practice fairness. Although admittedly I'm not perfect at it, I am someone who cares a lot about endeavoring to do so. 

But on the other hand, when I perceive/experience injustice I can become absolutely indignant. Heightened emotion. Rumination. Difficulty to compromise or let it go. And overall impulsive responses that---while principled---could certainly benefit from some basic tact. 

I'm wondering if any have experienced this, and had success with accentuating the positives and eliminating the negatives? ";r/ADHD;12;6;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqrizi/coping_with_justice_sensitivity/

- I get overwhelmed by everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, paying bills, or keeping appointments, and sometimes end up doing nothing.
- At work, I have trouble planning, prioritizing, and getting started on tasks; I get distracted easily and feel behind.
- I procrastinate tasks that are boring or mentally draining.
- I zone out in conversations, have trouble listening, or let others finish speaking.
- I can’t finish books, re-read sentences multiple times, and had trouble completing university (started my final exams multiple times, never finished).
- I make impulsive purchases and struggle with money.
- I hyperfocus intensely on new hobbies, buy so much stuff (photography, diamond painting, aquariums, games) and forget everything else.
- I constantly seek new stimulation (frequent job changes, changing friends in childhood...).
- I forget important things (appointments, keys, shopping items...).
- My mind is always racing – thought spirals, overanalyzing conversations, worst-case scenarios.
- I experience strong emotions, am highly sensitive to criticism or rejection, and need time alone to recharge.
- Stress management often involves eating sweets and also alcohol feels way too good when I drink it and I am pretty drawn to it but avoid it as much as possible due to family history.

2025-11-07 18:14:31;Advice;"My daughter, who is 17, has been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD (I have combined ADHD, and am currently unmedicated because of health issues). We’ve finally had her accepted for medication (12 hour extended release methyfenidate - Xaggitin XL) which I hope will help her, because she has really been struggling with focus and concentration in school.

The medication is arriving today, but I am going to be away all weekend for work, returning on Sunday evening. She is adamant that she wants to try it over the weekend, because she has been on the waiting list for years and years and finally this is something that might help. However, I have said that she can’t take it until Monday when I am around because I am worried that she could have unexpected side-effects and not have someone there to support her. Am I right in this or am I being too rigid? She will be around other people she knows and is comfortable with over the weekend, but not close family.

2025-11-07 16:34:33;ADHD- the most visible hidden illness;"Everyone I speak to knows within 5 minutes that I have ADHD. When I got diagnosed most people were shocked that I didn’t already know I had it. Honestly I love other people with ADHD and I love the traits that make up my personality.

But unfortunately I feel like so many people see ADHD as more of like, a personality type than an actual disorder. Sitting here at 1am with my thoughts racing wildly is driving me crazy. Hyper focused on several things I’m jumping between and can’t actually get anything done. Can’t focus at work, making mistakes. Struggling with addiction and the need for a constant *something*.

I guess I just wish people understood more. Having ADHD is more than just the obvious symptoms that, to be honest can be funny and even endearing. It goes way deeper and the struggle is so real.

2025-11-07 15:58:56;I think I am about to lose my job and don't know what to do. Please help.;"Hi everyone. I am very anxious and don't know what to do.

I was diagnosed back in Sept and since then I feel like my life has fallen apart. Obviously I have had ADHD my whole life but it is like I have become unable to do anything since I got confirmation of my diagnosis, and I haven't been unmasking on purpose. I am also waiting to be contacted by my GP to start titration.

I work in admin. When I started the job back in August, I did not tell them I thought I had ADHD because I did not have a diagnosis, I was anxious about potential ableism in the workplace, and in previous jobs, I was able to mask my ADHD enough in order to get through the day (much to my detriment but still). This time it is different. I haven't done a job that is solely admin before. Most of my roles previously have been hospitality and retail, however due to having POTS and being at the beginning of a symptom management plan for that, I struggle to do physically demanding jobs without flare ups or fainting spells. I thought I would be better at this job than I am.

  
Most of my job is answering emails and processing orders, and at first I thought this was pretty simple. But as time has gone on, I have found it more and more overwhelming. And over the past 3 months, I have made more and more mistakes. This is both confusing and frustrating to me, as I feel like the job isn't hard, just busy. Before I notified my boss of my diagnosis, I had had a few meetings regarding forgetfulness and not reading emails properly which has led to a lot of msitakes. I said I would work on this, as I do rush unintentionally, and made myself a visual note to slow down and double check everything. I also use a note organising software which helps me with remembering processes. These don't seem to be working. And after I told my boss about my diagnosis, he seems to be more irritated with me and my mistakes, especially as nothing seems to be helping. In fact, the way he responsed to my telling him was extremely hurtful and unprofessional, and since then any niceties around it has felt fake due to legal obligation. But I digress. 

  
Yesterday, myself, my supervisor and my boss sat down to discuss reasonable adjustments. I had a couple I thought might be useful but when I started to read them out, my boss interrupted me and started to rattle off every mistake I have made, emphasising how much my mistakes have cost the company. He said the adjustments I was suggesting wouldn't prevent me from misreading emails or mishearing people on the phone, and he was concerned that the ADHD traits I struggle with in these situations were going to be a ""continued problem."" He then asked me whether I think I'm capable of doing this job, saying that he doesn't want to put measures in place if I'm not going to improve within a month or two. The whole time he kept insinuating that I was incapable and that I should probably look for something ""easier.""

  
I need this job. It took me months to get hired after I lost my last one back in March. I need to pay my rent, Universal Credit is not enough and I was almost made homeless back in June. But I don't know what I can do to keep these mistakes from happening. I feel like I am working double time to ensure I am going over every single piece of work, every email, I am re-reading everything, and still I am making mistakes. At this point, I don't even know how. I don't even know what other kind of job I could feasibly do thanks to my physical issues.

2025-11-07 14:26:50;Taking ritalin and xanax with severe anxiety;"Hi. I got my ADHD diagnosis a couple of years ago but due to several issues I was only able to be on medication for about 6 months (I was taking concerta 27 mg at the time).
Fast forward to today and I'm at the lowest low I've ever been but also I finally have access to medication again. 

When I was taking concerta I did get mild anxiety but it was very managable and in general the medication helped a lot, however now on top of my ADHD I have very severe anxiety due to recent trauma. 

I'm attempting to finish collage in my current condition because I kinda don't have any other option and for that my psychiatrist prescribed me medikinet 20mg and I've been taking that for about two months, however after the meds only made my anxiety worse my psychiatrist just switched me to ritalin 10mg for just when I have to do schoolwork (he told me I could take it at most twice a day).

Today I tried taking the ritalin after a few days of not taking any ADHD meds to cool off, but again I returned to the crippling anxiety. My psychiatrist also prescribed me xanax drops (0.75mg/ml) as a ""rescue"" medication but I try not to take it when I take the ADHD meds because I'm afraid it might ""cancel out"" and leave me without being able to focus even thought my psychiatrist said it should be fine to take them at the same time. 

The thing is, my anxiety also leaves me unable to focus so I was wondering if anyone has experience mixing this two medications and has had any success getting over the anxiety while still being able to focus";r/ADHD;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqn38g/taking_ritalin_and_xanax_with_severe_anxiety/

2025-11-07 13:52:43;Diagnostic process and overthinking;"Hi dear community

(I translated this text from german to english since it's quite early here and my brain is mush)

‐-----

I’m currently in the process of getting assessed for ADHD. So far, I’ve had two long sessions with the psychotherapist (about 2.5 hours in total), plus I’ve filled out questionnaires about self- and external perception.

The therapist is very kind, professional, and I really feel taken seriously as a woman who suspects she might have ADHD. Our conversations were very open and honest, she asked good questions, and I think she’s got a pretty good understanding of my situation.

At the end, she said something like, “You definitely meet several/many criteria — of course I still have to evaluate everything properly, but on the spectrum…” and then she trailed off. So I’m assuming she’s quite certain that I’m neurodivergent, but she just wants to finish the assessment properly before saying anything definitive.
(Note: The AI didn't translate my sentence very well from german to english here. The ""trailing off"" part sounds much better and makes more sence in german because the sentence steucture is very different!"")

But why the hell am I overthinking all of this now?! My mind keeps spinning with questions... I keep worrying that I either exaggerated or downplayed things. I’m scared she might overlook my (well-compensated but still quite numerous) symptoms and not diagnose me correctly… OR that I overdid it and she’ll give me a diagnosis even though I don’t actually have ADHD. Help!

Then again, I think — girl, you struggle so much with impulsivity, emotions, and distractibility; you constantly lose or forget things, you’ve never been able to listen properly, you couldn’t organize your own studying, you’ve always felt different, had trouble connecting with others (especially women), swing between unbearable boredom and hyperfocus, and your son is also being evaluated for ADHD… how can you not see it???

2025-11-07 13:51:26;Late diagnosis of ADHD;"I’m from a country where ADHD isn’t even recognized as a real diagnosis. Any energetic kid was just called “hyperactive,” and that was it. No testing, no support — just “they’ll grow out of it.” A couple of years ago, after moving abroad, I finally went through proper testing and found out why life always felt a bit harder for me. Turns out, I have ADHD and depression (luckily the second one goes into remission sometimes).

For most of my life, teachers and parents told me I just wasn’t trying hard enough. That’s why I made “careless” mistakes when writing, reading, or taking notes. I constantly lost things and my train of thought.

I really believed (and still sometimes do) that it was all my fault. That I didn’t study enough, didn’t double-check enough, wasn’t good enough. I was always that girl who’s “smart but not hardworking” and tbh this kind of comments made me feel useless and stupid? Like, knowing how much effort I input, how hard it was hearing that it’s not enough… uh.  But whenever the homework overlapped with something I was actually passionate about, I could produce really detailed and creative work. Finally getting the diagnosis helped me stop blaming myself for everything and start learning how to use some of my ADHD traits instead of fighting them.

I wanted to share my story — and I’d love to hear yours. How did you first learn about your ADHD? Any videos, books, or articles that helped you understand it better?

This post was inspired by one of my professors. I believe this disclosure maybe already did helped me accept myself a bit more.

At the beginning of today’s appt with my psych nurse practitioner, she said she was going to make a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, because although my observer assessments came in very low scoring, she felt like she observed enough of me to determine that she could make that diagnosis.

But then she started going through a questionnaire, and she got to a question about whether I have procrastinated my whole life on things because I found the task boring, challenging, or repetitive. I agreed that I procrastinate, but I can’t seem to realize a motivation for that procrastination. I don’t have strong feelings one way or another about these tasks. It’s not that I don’t like doing them, I just don’t.

So that caused her to pause and decide that we’ll keep digging deeper before diagnosis. In the next two weeks I need to observe my procrastination and try to figure out why I’m procrastinating on the thing.

My question for you is: why do you put off doing the things you need to do? Especially if it’s for a reason other than it’s boring, challenging, or repetitive. What makes it hard to just do the neutral task?

2025-11-07 12:26:16;How do I change this bad mentality?;"Well to start things off, I consider myself to have undiagnosed ADHD, mainly because I see a lot of trends that I have that people with ADHD seem to have and I don’t have to money rn for a diagnosis (also because my mom disagrees with the idea of ADHD existing). Well I am mainly just trying to live life, but one thing that really bothers me is my negative mindset that I always have.

Basically, I get easily depressed after each failure I have and I do not recover for a long while. Idk if that just has to do with emotional strength but it is something that keeps bothering me because I really want to change it, but part of me either just forgets or ignores it. It also leads to my next part that I hate, which is how I somehow ignore changes that would be beneficial to me, especially mentally. I just have the urge to not do what I am thinking for some reason. If I think “Maybe I should try to learn after every mistake”, it won’t happen and I will still crash out after every mistake. That is what I think is wrong so far, I don’t know if anything else truly bothers me rn.

Not only do I want to change my mindset, I want to keep it as well. I don’t want it to ever change back to how it is rn. Also I am wondering if there are strategies to actually keep this mentality that isn’t only to think about it and it will happen (because it won’t happen if I just think about it)

Well anyways, sorry for the rant that I made but I hope I can get some helpful advice because I want a better future but I just don’t know how with ADHD existing. Thanks.";r/ADHD;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqkxbx/how_do_i_change_this_bad_mentality/
2025-11-07 12:04:48;Can’t get out of bed. Recently diagnosed with ADHD/Depression;"Hi. 30y/female. Recently found out that I have ADHD - inattentive type. Apparently I’ve had it most of my life. It was a tough thing to learn about myself. It was good because now I know my problem and I can start treating it to get better, and it was bad because I’ve gone my whole life starting and never finishing things and constantly quitting. I feel like I’ve wasted 30 years of my life. So I feel like that’s adding onto my depression if that makes sense.

I started adderall a week ago. It helps me stay focused and awake/aware, but that’s about it. It doesn’t help me get up in the morning and get to work. I was naively thinking it would help me with that. I wish I could be like normal people and just start the day, but that alone is a huge task for me. I wake up in a weird mood everyday. I don’t want to get up and start the day, I just want to stay in bed and sleep more. Sometimes I tell myself that I just want to sleep until I’m not sleepy anymore, but maybe that’s not possible. I slept about 14hrs yesterday, kind of using sleep as an excuse to avoid life. But I’m also very confused about it because I don’t understand how the hell I’m so sleepy all the time. I recently got labs done and have mildly low iron. Everything else seems fine. I did multiple evals and they diagnosed me with depression and ADHD. I just have a fear of starting antidepressants and not being able to get off of them when I need it or even the possibility of them making me a “zombie” like I hear a lot of people talking about. But I also have a fear of not being able to change and fix this problem. I’m already a zombie.

I just can’t get out of bed and it’s ruining my life. I’m ruining my life. So upset with myself.
Have any of you experienced this and had success with any meds? I’m not asking for medical advice or anything.. I hope this post follows all the rules. I would just love to know if anyone else has gone through this.";r/ADHD;13;38;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqkic4/cant_get_out_of_bed_recently_diagnosed_with/

2025-11-07 11:49:32;I'm lost and confused with life.;"I'm nearly 40 years old. I threw away my career 10 years ago after a bad breakup and tried to start a different career path. 
The study I'm doing is a 5 year uni degree full time. I want to do it but I've spent nearly 8 years on it and can't focus and now I'm getting older I feel like it's too late so I've enrolled in an adv. dimploma for next year which goes for 2 years and is something I'm really interested in and have been for a long time. It's a course to do with the building industry which in Australia hopefully should see me with a good career. 

I've had jobs here and there over the past 10 years but nothing I've stuck with. I've spent almost the last four years unemployed and on a student payment but obviously it's minimal to help paying the bills etc (my partner owns our house with a mortgage). I'm trying so hard to find a job but there's no one getting back to me and it's getting me really down and putting strain on our relationship as she works full-time and brings in 4k aud a fortnight and although she's been to rehab numerous times she still struggles with alcohol abuse and drinks every night. 

We had a massive argument a few weeks ago because when she gets drunk she's nasty and verbally abusive but she told me her friends and family don't like me because I have no job. They have have always been so nice to me and always said how much I do for her. Because I really do, support wise and being there for her through family deaths, rehab, etc

I have a phone interview for a job next week that sounds  promising. I've met the recruiters at a meet and greet event and fingers crossed it all goes well and I get a job.

My doc referred me to see a psych for adhd diagnosis and meds. I was diagnosed by a psychologist that the same psych referred me to a few years ago and I was supposed to go back to see the psych to get meds but I didn't (No money, procrastinating, laziness, I don't know why.)  About a month ago I called the psych - I needed a new referral and start the process again. I've done the referral and had most tests done. Need to do the drug test and ECG and then I can go back to the psych but at $1,100 aud for a diagnosis (The clinic said I won't get a medicare rebate because I've seen a psych this year for depression)
I can't afford to go yet but I know not being medicated isn't helping my life in the slightest. My partner has been angry so many times and told me to get medicated because of how I am. I try my hardest to focus and do the things I think need to be done but I know I'm failing miserably. 

This morning my partner got angry at me because while she was away working I hadn't cleaned the house enough. I started crying and told her that I've been struggling and don't want to be here (in the world) lately. She followed that up by telling me all the things that I do wrong, that she does bulk of the work and I'm not doing enough and her friends and family don't like me because I'm not working and bringing in enough money. 

I'm tired. I feel like I have nothing left in my tank. I feel like no matter how hard I try it's just never enough. I want to succeed and do things and go places and be amazing and I don't even know what I'm doing but I'm failing. When I put my mind to something I'm amazing but I feel like I need guidance  and I don't know what to do or how to get it. I feel alone and useless. 

I don't even know what advice I need but I need something, I need help - just someone to tell me what to do.

2025-11-07 11:43:42;How was your initial diagnosis?;"I saw a psychiatrist today, and he asked very few basic questions before diagnosing me with ADHD. It seemed like he based his judgment mostly on my self-reported patient intake form. Then he immediately prescribed medication. I've suspected for a while that I might have ADHD, but the whole experience didn't feel right. I thought it would be more sophisticated and thorough.

2025-11-07 11:42:51;Mom has an obsession with trying to prove I was misdiagnosed or I'm some druggie...;"Ok context  
When I was a kid I was very hyper and couldn't keep up with my classes and i was weird I couldn't really make friends. Everyone I've ever known has had the same complaint about me as a child, I was HYPER and WOULDN'T LISTEN. My teachers were also concerned about me so they told my mom to get me a diagnosis. She's crazy religious, and she noticed I couldnt stop moving in prayer and wouldnt pay attention (probably cuz idgaf) so she was concerned about it for a second. Also I'd get kicked out alot because I was distracting since I'd move alot. I ALMOST got help, my pediatrician said I has a lot of symptoms and I should get full testing to get accommodated and possibly put on medication. My parents were like HELL NAH WE CANT HAVE HER ON THESE DRUGS (they're brown they don't believe in medicine/doctors/treatment) so no treatment.  
  
I got diagnosed at 17. After months and months of appointments, and also going to my physician who's specialized in ADHD.  
When I would go to the physician, my mom would try undermining a lot of my symptoms. THE SYMPTOMS SHE WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT DAILY???? ""Like she struggles SOMETIMESS to clean her room but she's okay! we even help her"" NONE of that is true. Its never clean and quite literally been a mess for a whole month. I have more examples but I want advice. Im probably gonna go back to therapy or not speak to her. She also kept saying ""well i think she has a MILDDDD ADHD I dont see her struggling that much"" over and over, just kept saying it was mild. ITS NOT.  
Prior to that, I was struggling a lot. In my senior year of high school I was straight up suicidal. I couldn't do any of my work I was straight up done with life I would also cut on the daily. I had A LOT to hide from my mom. I fully believe she knows nothing about me. I don't like her company either she's really annoying and tries to rage bait me so it sucks being around her and her stupid shit on the daily.  
My mom DROPPED OUT her first year of college because it was ""too much"" then just got married at 19. My guess is that I got ADHD FROM her because she has A LOT  of symptoms : impulsive and excessive spending, hyper fixating, pooooor attention span, poor listening skills, talks tm and deliberately annoying, EXTREMELYYY EXTREMELYYY (I cant emphasize this enough) FORGETFUL. ALLLLL HER ITEMS HAVE AIRTAGS. IM NOT EXAGGERATING. Sometimes I really do think she's far worse then me and has ADHD. but maybe my dad a little js from the mood stuff.  
She just started taking college courses, on ECE, RIGHT when I started uni, one of them is psych. 

In her course, she's learning about children with ADHD and she used this against me... ""Kids with ADHD are not dumb, just behind! everyone has a different pace in learning. You don't have ADHD! You just learn at a different pace.""   
dawg i struggle with SO MUCH MORE THEN LEARNING AT A DIFFERENT PACE ARE U SERIOUS? She also just has an issue with me having it as a whole I think...? ""Don't label yourself that! You being ADHD means you're thinking of yourself as uncapable!"" I don't go around telling people I am or using it as an excuse?? She also hates that people are getting accommodated for whatever reason... like you go to basically a community college.   
She also sends me tiktoks that are like ""How I cured my ADHD!-- Its all in your head!! Change the way you think""  
I'm on meds and they've REALLY helped me and I can feel the difference but she keeps telling me shit like ""Oh you are I didnt even notice"" while people around me all do. Including my sister, my mood/focus has greatly improved now that I'm on the right dose.   
I tried counselling through school and I didn't like it... Felt like she wasn't really listening to what I would have to say. I'd go again just not to her.   
Also because I'm on my meds, I started losing a little weight because I'm not impulsively eating yk? I don't say anything about it but I guess she's noticed. She's really fat. EVERYDAY she complains about it. So she takes it out on me I SWEAR. I said oolong tea sped up my metabolism and she went ""Yea better than drugs"" like ok...  
She told my dad today ""no way she has ADHD! its all bs. I learned in psych today that its genetic... so just because I need to work somewhere with no noise means I have it?"" and my dad went ""ugh ya so that means I have it just because I get annoyed too? such bs""  
She's been taunting me with this shit for the past 3 years. I am sick of it. I was properly diagnosed bruh, my teachers, doctors and even she confirmed it.  
My life now that I'm in uni, have friends, getting all the help i need and medicated is great, my high school environment was stressful and I was at my breaking point so Idk why shes being such a ... piece of work.

2025-11-07 11:21:26;Likely ADHD in University/College - unsure whether to re-enroll or drop out entirely;"Hey I need some serious advice from anyone here who is in the same situation that I'm in. It's a little oddly specific but I'm hoping someone relates.   
I've wanted to go to university my entire life, so I started studying straight out of high school (I was 17 years old, first mistake). I was studying criminology and psychology, and ended up taking a year long leave of absence because I just wasn't enjoying it anymore, plus I was failing. My intention has been to drop out officially since then. Here is the first conundrum. I can't figure out if I wasn't enjoying it because I was failing, or whether I was failing because I wasn't enjoying it.   
Second conundrum is that my university texted me reminding me that my leave of absence is nearly over, and if I want to re-enroll I need to do in in the next month. Now I'm reconsidering dropping out because I **do** genuinely want to study and get qualifications, especially with the current job market.   
Third conundrum is that if I was to go back to university, which right now is seeming like my favourite option, I have no idea what to do. I have hobbies, but no interest in making a career out of those hobbies. The only job I've ever had that I've enjoyed is in politics, but I know from friends that a politics degree is tough, and idk if my probable (non-diagnosed) ADHD will be able to handle that.   
My fourth conundrum is that probable but non-diagnosed ADHD. I know there are good support systems at my university because I made use of them when I was studying the first time, but they didn't work for me then. So I'm not really sure if I can keep up non-failing grades, and even moreso I'm not sure how I'll handle it if I start to fail again.   
I've booked a student advisor appointment but would love to know if there are people here in similar or the same situation.";r/ADHD;2;4;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqjnfq/likely_adhd_in_universitycollege_unsure_whether/

Even on my regular Dr visits, they always check my blood pressure which is high since I started taking  ADHD meds(I’m on BP meds but I’m terrible at remembering to take them) but they never advise me to get an ECG done.

2025-11-07 10:43:38;Recently diagnosed - How do I start doing things?;"Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with adhd and slowly moved up to 50mg of Vyvanse. I know the meds are finally helping slightly and I do see some behaviour change, but for the life of me I cannot start anything. Even if I want to or don’t want to do it. I will be on bed, super anxious practically begging myself to just get up and do not, but I cannot.

I look at advice online, people say download this app and that app. It requires so much effort to even open the apps, let alone stick with it. A pet app where the pet gets sad if I don’t work doesn’t work on me. Or when people say oh I pretend this and that so I get my work done. I cant lie to myself and pretend.
I feel like the only thing that has worked is body doubling, but I don’t have access to a person all the time. 

All my life I have built terrible habits due to my adhd and now that I have some sort of support, the bad habits are still there and I think that’s what’s stopping me. When I start working I am fine, but that doesn’t matter if I simply cannot get up to start.

2025-11-07 10:02:05;Might have Autism after all...;"I went into my ADHD diagnosis sessions quite sure I didn't have Autism (not understanding how much of a spectrum it *really* is), and the psychiatrist diagnosing me agreed based on my questionnaire results that I just had ADHD and not autism.

Since then though, I've of course been learning a lot about neurodivergence and been seeing **some** autistic traits in myself, but hey I don't have *all* of the traits, and it wouldn't change anything to know anyway, so I never thought too hard about it.

But I've met with a Mental Health Social Worker a couple of times now through EAP at work, who specialises in ADHD and Autism (with her own personal experience), and she has been an absolute GODSEND in understanding myself, and the ""why"" of the way I think and act. Today as I was explaining a certain incident with someone at work, she commented that the way I was feeling and reacting was ""soooo ADHD"" and casually added somewhere along the way that I sounded like I had ""a bit of autism"". And it was *so insanely validating* to hear someone else say these things the way that she did... she was just stating a fact. I NEVER suggested along the way that I thought I had some traits, she just recognised it and said it. Someone I'm not paying an insane amount of money, to say what I want they think I want to hear. Even 2 years on, knowing in my heart that my behavior alone *proves* I'm neurodivergent, I still have lingering Imposter Syndrome from being diagnosed via Telehealth, within a single 1-2hr session, after answering some lengthy quizzes and having a chat about why I thought I had ADHD. You hear all sorts of horror stories with these types of diagnosis', and so I always had the lingering doubt that I was.

But to have someone hear big parts of my life story, listen to me try to explain how I feel towards certain types of people, and to be able to point out not only *why* I feel this way but also delve deeper and confirm with a simple throw-away comment the thing that I always kinda-secretly suspected about myself (the 'tism)... I just feel such a weight off my shoulders today, and I just had to tell someone. Even if it's just some random Reddit strangers.

2025-11-07 09:24:23;Is it normal to get chest discomfort/tightness and migraine headaches, and still feel really wired from Vyvanse in the night (even though I took it at 8 AM)?;"Hey guys, I (25F) took my first ever dose of Vyvanse (10 mg) this morning at 8 AM. I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 16 years old, but I was always hesitant to get medicated because I feel really weird on just regular coffee too (anxious, jittery, chest discomfort, etc.). I have recently found it increasingly harder to get out of bed or focus on anything, and the ADHD paralysis and procrastination has been bad enough that I might lose my job, so I decided to finally get medicated. I took my first dose this morning at 8 AM. I definitely felt like I could concentrate better, and got a lot of work done which is very unusual for me. I was able to work for 12 hours straight. I do have chronic migraines, but I rarely get 1 a month these days. However, I started getting a horrible migraine around 12 pm, and it kept getting worse so I had to take my migraine meds too, which for some reason didn't work (I don't know if its a regular headache instead of a migraine, or Vyvanse just gave me a horrible one?) I also started having chest discomfort, heart palpitations in the afternoon which I'm still feeling at 10 PM. I still feel really wired like I've had way too much coffee, and I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight. I thought this medication was supposed to start wearing off by now? Is something wrong with me? I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight!

Other Info: I take PPI (pantoprazole) everyday for gastritis, monthly injection for migraines (Aimovig), and iron and vitamin D pills as I'm severely deficient. I also took half a Tums today since my stomach was burning from the gastritis.

2025-11-07 08:57:27;High sensitivity to caffeine ?;"I got my ADHD diagnosis last month and now I've been reflecting on a lot of things that could be linked to my ADHD. Caffeine in ADHD people seems to either do nothing or simply make them more tired, but it's kinda the opposite for me ? 

Sometimes I get more tired if I already was, but for example the other day I drank two cups of white tea and even though it's supposed to be lower in caffeine than green tea, it made me super jittery and hyperactive for the entire day. Felt like I could run a whole ass marathon by myself and I absolutely could not sleep that night. It happens with either tea and coffee (which I tend to avoid for this reason). 

I have the same type of low tolerance for alcohol and cannabis too, the former gives me some sort of sinking feeling in my body that I absolutely hate, even the smallest quantity of it. And the latter juste gives me panic attacks.

Or simply when you hit a wall how can you bring yourself to keep working on your projects?

I tried this route but failed miserably and it was a tough failure as I always justified my scholastic and professional failures to not being interested in the topic.. I ended up failing the very same way on my personal goals (which is what prompted me to get my adhd diagnosis).

One problem I faced, *aside from being unable to tackle the most boring stuff and having all of my projects decently made up to 70% and the rest hastily put together in the cheapest unflattering way*, is that I procrastinate a lot, and in an environment without tangible consequences as the self employed one I end up postponing and postponing and I lose all the momentum. 

To be honest I also fail to retain information and when I finally find the strength to get back at it I have to google for the simplest things, I feel like the movie Memento's protagonist

As an aside the only way I seem to manage to achieve something is if I dont work forward something and instead act with no plan and think about every step as I go.

2025-11-07 08:29:27;I've been working with an ADHD coach, and it's really been helping!!;"I've been to several therapists pre diagnosis and always struggled! For whatever reason all the therapists i try to talk to feel so intense, they want to help RIGHT NOW and i totally get that, but my mind is often jumbled and i don't really like the way therapies are typically structured. 

On top of that it takes me a while to feel comfortable opening up in the first place, and therapists often try to ""dig"" into my emotions and it ends up feeling invasive. Ive tried telling the therapist that i really just appreciate the space to verbally process information and that's often all i need. Just a space to express and feel heard without someone being confused as to why i do things or forcing me to explain my actions or thoughts. Even though i explain this, it doesn't seem to matter, they still seem to feel like their job isn't done until they know exactly how to help me in a concrete way. 

But this coach is different! There's never an agenda for our sessions. I can show up and yap about whatever i want, and she validates my feelings and experiences, and she always finds a way to keep things uplifting! It's been exactly what i needed this whole time! I always feel better after i talk things out but people often try to jump in and tell me exactly how my problems could be solved or ask me why im doing things a certain way (im good at self accommodating but of course the way i do things is different), or they just generally don't understand what im feeling or experiencing (i live with my mom and she has NEVER understood me, i always get caught in an explanation loop and then i get upset and end up feeling worse).

2025-11-07 08:06:19;If you have ADHD and anxiety, and are on stimulants, do you sleep?;"For context, I am 40, just got diagnosed in the wake of perimenopause. I was diagnosed at 15 with anxiety, which I now understand is a coping mechanism for the ADHD. Because of never being treated for ADHD, the anxiety seems to be hardwired into my system and I have to be medicated to sleep. I’ve taken 2 non-stimulants and sleep was non-existent on one (Strattera) and has not been good on the current one (guanfacine). Stimulants seem to be the route we will take next and I’m nervous that I won’t sleep. 

I’ve seen the post about if your anxiety goes away after starting ADHD meds, then it was never anxiety and I will say Strattera killed my anxiety, but I’m still nervous about stimulants affecting my sleep.

I’m the type to truly enjoy being hyper productive/ almost always having something to do, and because of this l find it difficult to engage in self-care. Recently I’ve really noticed whenever I have unstructured free time I feel stuck. I want to relax, but nothing even sounds remotely enjoyable.

2025-11-07 07:57:35;Help focusing and working in a classroom environment;"I have recently started my first year of university (uk) and am studying a creative subject. It took a while but I've finally worked out a method to focus and work well enough to get my assignments and essential reading done outside of class. However, one of my modules has begun using class time to do writing exercises where we all have 10 minutes in silence to write something. I simply cannot do this. Everyone else around me gets straight to work and then has something to share when the time is up, but I cannot manage anything in those conditions. 

When I am on my own I use music playing through my headphones next to me, but not actually wearing them because after a while that feels oppressive or overwhelming, and I fidget excessively. I cannot do that in a seminar because it is silent conditions, and my fidgeting would be disruptive.

I need some advice for how to get work done in this setting because I am not able to engage in the class otherwise, and my class size is also small enough that I am noticeable to the lecturer. 

Disclaimer that I do not have an ADHD diagnosis, and therefore do not use the label. However, I am in the process of getting an assessment, and have overall found that ADHD techniques are the most effective way for me to manage my lifestyle and my day. That is why I've chosen to ask my question here.

TL;DR I need advice to do writing in a silent classroom setting, where I cannot fidget or create background noise.";r/ADHD;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqf7lt/help_focusing_and_working_in_a_classroom/

2025-11-07 07:00:10;Food just got wasted, but for the other reasons completely.;"I am 34M, just got diagnosed around 3 months ago and while going through breakup at the same time, burnout, unemployment as well, I’m trying to be positive and kind to myself. Well, until today.

Just recently I found a new job which I actually enjoy, I think I’m good at it and generally, things go well. I massively cut down on substances, trying to get to bed early, take supplements, eat better, got a massive health check up etc. So I was on a positive side of things, but we all sometimes trip. And oh boy, did I faceplant today.

I wake up in the morning, go to shower, hit that light switch and there it is. Darkness. I don’t think much of it, because my heating and hot water is separate, so I take my shower, get out, check my fuses, all in order. I get dressed and leave.

I go to work but that no electricity bugs me. So I keep pinging my Wi-Fi appliances, they’re dead. I ping my ex, she goes and checks, no power. 

I send email to my management company, in the meantime I dodge from work and go home. And yeah, I stand there in front of my house and read the response - your electricity meter has been disconnected. I try to sort out possible reasons in my head in a rapid fire mode.

Turns out, a year ago when I moved here, I forgot to register the meter with electricity supplier under my name. So they didn’t know who is responsible and nobody paid so they just switched it off. 

I felt hopeless, angry and just genuinely stupid about this. How such a small mistake could carry so much consequences. 

My window blinds are down, and yeah, they are electric… Wasted food from the fridge is why.";r/ADHD;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqdttj/food_just_got_wasted_but_for_the_other_reasons/
2025-11-07 06:50:49;Methylphenidate;"Hi everyone just a bit of a backstory I got diagnosed with adhd about 3 months ago and I started my medication journey about 2 months ago. I first tried Elvanse however is wasn’t reacting the best to it as the crashes where just awful and they would happen far to early in my day. 
I quickly got switched over to methylphenidate which I have reacted to better. I started off on 5mg which didn’t seem to have much effect on me so after 2 weeks I was put on 10mg. I’ve been on 10mg for about a week and a half now and it definitely has more of an effect and seems to help with some of my adhd symptoms however I’m still struggling with quite a few symptoms with adhd which I hoped the medication would help. I’m not sure weather to stay on methylphenidate as it helps me a little bit or weather to try a different medication. Maybe someone out there has some advice or recommendations that could help me out. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

2025-11-07 06:50:38;What free (or low cost) things give you dopamine? Trying to kick a spending habit!;"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and i'm medicated. I am technically getting enough dopamine now but for years I wasn't, so I developed an impulsive spending habit as a coping mechanism. Now **every time something good happens or I want to reward myself, I spend money. When i'm bored? Spend money. When i'm sad...you guessed it. Spend money!**

It's getting a bit out of control. I'm thankfully not in debt but my finances aren't in great shape either. 

**So what ways can I reward myself or get dopamine that don't involve spending (a lot or any) money? Bonus points if they're easy, quick, and relatively low effort.**

I know the underlying issue is a lack of emotional regulation skills. I'm thankfully in therapy, but that takes time to develop. I want quick easy wins in the meantime. 

Some things I do so far: 

* Go on walks
* Pet the neighbourhood cat
* Playing games on the NYTimes app (it's a subscription but it's VERY affordable) 
* Watching comfort shows
* Knitting/Crocheting
* Listening to music

EDIT: **Y'all I love libraries too BUT i'm from a third world country and well-stocked/easily accesible/online public libraries aren't a thing where I live.** 😭😭😭 ";r/adhdwomen;299;204;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oqdlml/what_free_or_low_cost_things_give_you_dopamine/

2025-11-07 06:37:29;Depression? Crippling anxiety(take your pick on GAD or SAD)? Constant guilt ? Severe under-stimulation?;"I’m 29yrs old and I’ve seen counselors my entire school career, had 2 therapists outside of school, all before ever becoming an adult, but somehow never got clocked for the obvious signs 🪧 that I seriously need help/ a diagnosis. Grew up to then have 2 girls (6yrs & 3yrs) of my own, just to be confronted with the reality that we are all somewhere on the co-morbid spectrum. SAHM who also homeschools (no we aren’t religious, though if anything- you could say we focus on Buddhist like principles), and holy freaking cow do we NOT have a community, seriously it’s just my husband and I these last 8 years tackling this life together with our crazy and goofy girls. 

Here’s what I have worked on so far, 

         Have self implemented CBT on my own years ago to help with the controllable thoughts and feelings that worked against me. 

         Read lots of books. Self-help, psychology, Buddhist books, writing improvement books. 

         Been continuously keeping up my exercise routine for the last 2 years CONSISTENTLY. 

         Aiming for twice a day, but maintaining at least 1-2 times brushing my teeth daily as a habit for the last 2 years as well. (It has always been a struggle for me)

       I have hobbies (too many interests if you ask me) I write, I write poetry, I draw, read books & manga, I play video games 🎮, and started tarot. Good luck juggling them in a balanced way tho- am I right? 

        I maintain a healthy, balanced, and decently well rounded diet. 

         I have a very loving relationship with my husband, and we still always make time for intimacy. 

          I don’t have a lot of friends, but I do snap/ video-snap daily and chat on the phone with my best friend regularly. (She and her family moved to a state quite far away from us a few years ago) 


I just don’t get what the fuck is wrong with my brain anymore or what I should be tackling first. The actual feelings?… I am just so tired, I get plenty of rest, but I just don’t got the energy in me. I am losing the ability to take joy and feel pleasure in all the things that I felt like mattered most to me. Drowning in worries about many different things that I can’t shake daily. I feel I am letting everyone down due to my own limitations and hang-ups that I’ve been experiencing my whole life. And the lack of self worth/self confidence hasn’t improved despite all my efforts. Things that have been exacerbated due to lack of using what skills I had acquired for a while now.

Since I’m not diagnosed I can’t say for sure what is going on, but I have found myself to be most aligned with ASD/ADHD, previously a severe people pleaser (CPTSD), a past tendency to be pure O with the excessive ruminating I’ve done over the years (now I’ve just deadened my brain so badly to not hardly be able to think at all when trying to avoid it), and a past of constantly chasing dopamine in various very unhealthy ways. 

I’ve never been a career woman, so I don’t have any hang-ups about that sort of thing. If anything it’s a good thing I have my husband who is so willing to support me even if I didn’t ever want to go back to work. Though I did take pride and joy in the simple jobs I did before with waiting tables and bartending, I’m truly not suited for much else. 

I just feel so directionless in life. For the majority of my life I struggled with suicide ideation, but am one of those people who could never self harm or actually kill myself. I just logic’d my way out of why I shouldn’t even try. Still I had just wished everyday that I hadn’t of woken up. Now it’s not near as bad, but still experience unwanted thoughts of not waking up anymore.  I am lacking the conviction to be present for everyone in my life and be truly appreciative of them- no matter how hard I try to be grateful daily. I feel so disconnected from myself as a person, my hobbies have been slowly slipping away from me. The ADHD guilt/paralysis cycle has been taking root more than not again. It’s even wearing my husband down, who just wants to see me make decisions for myself and be happy enjoying things I love. I used to think I could be funny and bubbly, weird of course due to not really understanding of how to people correctly, but nonetheless endearing and personable. Now… I’m just an annoying, micro-managing, on-edge, and always schedule sticking to parent. Painfully aware of hard it is for me to connect with people superficially or deeply in the wild, especially the other parents I interact with daily. 

We are a one income household; the government handles the girls’ health insurance, but we all know that the US economy is ass, both my husband and I cannot afford it for ourselves. Nor will the government cover us because somehow we are right at the cusp that they think we got this 🙃?? We don’t even make 50,000 a year. 

I’m not sure what the point of this is…. I’m just unsure of if I should be trying to get on a SSRI’s (tho I’m terrified of it making me gain weight or ruining my sex life), if I should be trying to treat the ADHD, just get a formal diagnosis(which the math ain’t mathing or how to make any of that happen), get out of the house for a hobby, or get a part-time job so at least I am making money AND out of the house. 
Or something else I’m missing altogether.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time and I hope you have a peaceful day. ";r/adhdwomen;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oqda6n/depression_crippling_anxietytake_your_pick_on_gad/
2025-11-07 06:28:03;A bit of advice;"Hi there. 

I am 48 and have had a life consumed with eating disorders, depression, imposter syndrome, fear of failure, low self esteem etc. I just don’t enjoy life. My dad died in a road traffic accident a few years from our house when I was 10 and my mum didn’t give me and my brothers the opportunity to grieve before moving on with my step dad. 

My older brother was diagnosed with ADHD a couple of years ago and has said to me that he feels I too could have ADHD. 

I feel like it would be beneficial to be tested for ADHD but I am worried that I will be wasting peoples time and will be a fraud if I go and I am not diagnosed. 

I have a very well paid job, a lovely family and supportive husband but just don’t enjoy myself. I never relax, i constantly fidget, my brain is always going at a million miles an hour, I exercise myself into the ground and nothing I do is ever good enough. 

I have been on anti depressants in the past but do not take them currently as didn’t feel they helped. I am wondering if ADHD meds might. 

I’d be interested to know whether anyone else felt similar to me and then had a diagnosis of ADHD and improved their life when they started taking medication. 

Thanks

2025-11-07 06:12:15;Quick question about Elvanse?;"**TLTR** I’m worried my tablets have already stopped working after a few days? Has this happened for anyone else and been fine?** 

Hi, so I started Elvanse 30mg on Sunday. I was diagnosed just over a week ago, and I am about 5 days in to taking Elvanse 30mg. 

The current plan is to start on 30mg for a week, two weeks on 50mg then review to tweak the dosage if needed. 

At first I was like ‘the 30mg is great, I feel amazing, the anxiety feels like it’s gone. I wish I had always felt like this!’ 

Every day I’ve had a tired crash around 7-8pm, but yesterday it was around 4pm and the overthinking started. I’m not sure if the overthinking feels bad because I haven’t had any anxiety with the medication, so when it’s wearing off it just feels bad in comparison. But wow it’s been bad. 

Today the crash started at like 3pm. 

There are a few things I can think it is, but I started to overthink that the tablets aren’t going to work for me and I’m just going to burn through them quickly, even if I up the dose. (Again, this is probably overthinking related to the adhd when the meds have worn off.) 

I think it’s 
a) tiredness from the poor sleep from the earlier days of the meds
b) adjusting to the dose

Part of it is lack of sleep and side effects, ironically the tablets work better when you have good diet and sleep, which the side effects stop you from doing. I have been having high protein breakfasts and making sure I have lunch and dinner, even if it’s something small to eat. 

I’m just worried that the tablets have stopped working for me already. Has anyone else experienced this, but then turned out fine? ";r/adhdwomen;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oqcnun/quick_question_about_elvanse/
2025-11-07 05:42:38;Need help with my 24F partner 27M with ADHD managing impulse control/medication;"We have been together for 2 years. My partner has been diagnosed with ADHD when he was in his early 20s and was on medication for this briefly. He said it helped but didn’t think he needed it beyond getting through university. He has serious issues with impulse control and it’s getting to a point where it’s getting out of hand. 

He recently got into a car crash where the impulse control/fixation of ideas is tied to the cause. He didn’t get hurt and no one else was involved but his car (which he had again bought on impulse) has been completely written off. I don’t really know how to go about discussing this topic. 

We are currently long distance but he’s coming to see me for a week in 3 days time. He is living in my country at the moment and I don’t think he will be able to get meds with his travel insurance but he will be going back to his country for 6 weeks in January. From what I’ve heard, it doesn’t sound like his family is super supportive of him getting on meds/don’t think he needs it but from what me and my family have observed (we are all health professionals with some of us being in psychology/psychiatry) we think he needs more tools to help him cope with his ADHD. I’ve spoken to him in bits and pieces about managing better but he brushes it off/takes it as an attack. He’s got bad RSD and can be very combative/stubborn.

How can I go about broaching this topic to him without coming across as too harsh? I unfortunately have a tendency of coming across as harsh/ unempathetic. I want the best for him and us as we move forward especially since we are looking to move in together and gain permanent visa status for him next year.";r/ADHD;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oqbwlg/need_help_with_my_24f_partner_27m_with_adhd/
2025-11-07 05:15:07;Sometimes I’m sad that my partner doesn’t educate himself on ADHD;"Hey guys, I want to start by saying, my partner is a wonderful human being and I love him very much.
This is complaining on a very high level haha. He supports me a lot and he’s my safe space. He’s NT and we’ve been together for 7 years. I just got my diagnosis a few months ago but have been looking into it for around 4 years now. 

My issue is that he listens to me telling him about my newest revelations, break-throughs in therapy or the podcast I’m listening to right now about ADHD in women. He just doesn’t seem to be interested in educating himself on the subject. Sometimes I get so tired of advocating for myself, always having to explain and teaching him basically.

I get that ADHD is my responsibility first and foremost. And that I have to tell him what’s going on in my brain. I think what I mean is: there are so many aspects of how ADHD affects relationships and how we can learn to understand each other as ADHD and NT. I want him to educate himself on that aspect. He brings his own issues and old baggage into this relationship too and I don’t feel like he takes accountability for that. His neurotypical-ness is unfamiliar for me too. I think he just assumes that because I am the one with the disability, it’s my responsibility to figure out a way to make this relationship work. And I don’t mean that in a malicious way, more in a „I am unaware I am doing that“ way.

I’m just tired sometimes. Every day I have to advocate for myself in this world and I just wish, I wouldn’t need to do it at home too. We talked about all the above many times before. I just feel like, he doesn’t understand how important it would be for me. 

I’m so conflicted because he works full time and the last few months weren’t easy for us both. My diagnosis is a challenge we both face everyday. I don’t know if I’m asking too much and am being unreasonable. What do you think? I’d love to hear your opinions, experiences and advice!

2025-11-07 05:12:22;Emotions after diagnosis and medication use;"
I 28f was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago. I currently take 30mg Vyvanse and I have recently noticed that I enjoy a lot of the things I used to find almost impossible to keep up with (organization,cleaning,self care).. at times it makes me sad for my past self that craved those things but thought I wasn’t motivated or disciplined enough to do them. I also noticed that I am able to say “actually I’m not hungry for that/I don’t actually want that right now” when I’m bored and go to reach for something not super nutritious/a quick dopamine food. 

Has this been your experience too? 

I find I’m constantly trying to tell myself that “maybe I’m just faking this” when at the same time I know that when I started my medication it felt like the “white noise got turned down” if that makes any sense… 

Also, did anyone else experience getting actual “chills/shiver” when brushing your teeth or seeing someone brush their teeth previously but not have that after starting medication? I think maybe I had a physical sensory aversion to it that made it hard to do in the past?

I have been working print type jobs for a while it is a lot of repetitive work so you would think it would be quick and easy but I have come to find out I can’t do things fast without making stupid mistakes or forgetting important steps I have already been let go from a previous job similar to my current one where I was operating printing machinery and now I more so focus on processing orders for print etc. But when it came to those jobs the goal was to complete as much work as possible in the shortest amount of time. Unfortunately it seems to me like all jobs are like that but that kind of structure is so hard for me to thrive in and I can’t even be sure that if I -was- medicated I would be employee of the month. 

Does anyone else feel this way?

I was diagnosed with ADHD last year. I kinda self-medicate with caffeine and that helps me focus in social situations. I’ve also been on Lexapro for the past 10 years for anxiety and depression, I have been feeling a lot better lately and I sometimes wonder if I don’t need it anymore but I’m afraid to go off it since I’ve been taking it for so long. I tried guanfacine but it didn’t seem to do anything except I thought I was more depressed while on it (although my psych said it doesn’t cause depression so idk) so my psych recommended a stimulant, but I’ve been hesitant to try it because I’m worried about potential side effects and whether they’d be worth it. I’d like to hear from both medicated and unmedicated people. If you are medicated, what has been your experience? And if you’re unmedicated, why do you choose not to take medication and do you have any coping mechanisms/strategies to help with your symptoms?

I have a trip this month and I would like my normal medication where I feel good on. Not the generic where I feel shitty. Is there something I can say or do to get my proper medication for my trip even though the month with the generic prescription is not up? I can’t seem to find another neurologist or prescriber that is so lenient. I only have to go in for an appointment every two months. I went to her, hoping that I would be evaluated though I do know I have ADHD inattentive type and have been informally diagnosed by psychiatrist and school evaluations. She’s never asked me one question and only talks about herself. She’s never been able to answer any of my questions that I’ve had about the medication and the diet that corresponds with it. ;r/ADHD;2;5;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oq8pso/please_help_me_navigate_this_medication_mixup/

2025-11-07 03:31:20;I need advice on managing my ADHD with medication better.;"So I am 24f. I got my diagnosis earlier this year. I always knew I am somewhere on the neurodivergent spectrum. But did not see this coming. 

My psychiatrist has started me on 10-20mg of methylphenidate (Inspiral). Now I can take 10mg if that works or take 20 once or split it. 

On some days 10mg seem fine, and on some it does nothing. Then on 20mg I was so productive. 

I try to keep a track of everything. Its going to be over a month since I would be on medication. It is definitely working for me. But I can’t figure out what dose is working for me. 

I usually crash around 5 or 7/8ish pm. I take my dose around 9:30/10 am in the morning. 

I am doing everything I can. Eating well, staying hydrated. Following dopamine menu, I meet my therapist twice a month. Yet on random days the crash would hit me out of nowhere. I would be in the gym and struggling to move. I literally have to sit in the locker room for a while before leaving. And then on the way back (15 mins walk) bribe myself with food. 

I honestly would appreciate all the advice I can get with what works out for you. 

I am struggling with the following things the most: 
1. Random crash in the evening. 
2. Dosage (I don’t know how to figure out what works) 
3. Do you also feel extra hungry on meds? ( I sometimes get a terrible reflux in the night or day, since I started the medication) 
4. Emotional regulations. I get so upset when things don’t go my way. It could be as simple as the store did not have what I wanted. This would make me extremely upset and then I can’t get anything done. 
5. I also feel like I am a product of my adhd and my whole life is a result of it. Eg. impulsive purchases, hobbies that I would disappear in and then loose interest. (I make  beautiful crochet stuff and other craftsy things. But once I am done, nothing feels exciting, until i move on to my next obsession which could be reading, games, binge watching). I hope you get the gist. 

I would love to hear from you.

2025-11-07 02:40:07;Well, what now??;"I was recently diagnosed with inattentive type and I've been really grappling with how to best handle the coming steps. I have been an extremely anxious person my whole life, but I've always been able to externally present that I've got my life together. Internally, I've been on the brink for years. 

I want to talk about it with friends and family, but I've seemingly held things together on the outside for so long, that one of the two people I've told have already really questioned me. When discussing just the testing process with another friend, they asked, ""You don't think you need medication, do you?"". That combined with my own self doubt, I'm questioning if I even am in the right place... But the psychologist that did my testing stated both before and after the assessment that her methods are rigorous and she only diagnoses people if she is absolutely certain. I've been stuck on this loop and I'm having a hard time thinking about literally anything else. I talk to people in a regular capacity and everything they say goes in one ear and out the other because my mind is so preoccupied. I feel like a bad friend, I feel like I'm making things seem worse than they are, but mostly, I am frozen and don't know where to turn. 

Medication is intimidating. I've tried two different SSRIs and anxiety medicine in the past with little to no benefit - the SSRIs were most definitely making me worse and the anxiety medicine took the sting out. I've been working with a therapist for a long time and have worked through A LOT, but there are things I still struggle with no matter what I do. Executive function, RSD, overthinking, emotional processing, working memory issues. So I want to try stimulants to see if that can help with the daily struggles. Then I spiral and worry that my doctor is going to ask me what I struggle with and I won't be able to verbalize what I'm feeling or I'll downplay it and I'll leave with nothing or the wrong medication. 

I'm thankful for this community because I'm seeing every single day other people struggling with similar issues, but I also don't know how to communicate this with my friends and family. I suppose I want some advice, but I don't even know what to ask for? 

Any support from strangers who have been through this would be helpful.

i feel really disappointment in myself for some reason. i know medication is only a tool and that you also have to put in the work but im still not putting in the work. im still arguing with myself in my brain about small tasks and end up unable to complete them. i want so badly to be better, to feel normal, to not struggle to brush my teeth for weeks at a time or to just do the dishes. it’s so simple, you get up and do the dishes. but i cant. i’m so upset that i cant. 

anyways, i know its just week one. i need to be patient and give myself grace but also i really want to be better all at once and im very mad at myself that im not pushing hard to achieve this

Started having more issues with focus, brain fog, prioritizing etc so I sought some help. Quickly got diagnosed and put on Vyvanse. The Vyvanse did not agree with me at all, had serious brain fog and literally made everything 10X worse, plus horrible headaches.

Switched to Adderall recently and I'm not getting much improvement? I feel spaced out when I take it, some days I feel like I didn't take anything, other days it makes me anxious, some days I get sleepy.  And overall when I take it I feel way too toned down. I'm usually upbeat and happy, on meds I'm just 😐 there.

I was hoping just for some clarity, focus and energy, I'm extremely burnt out, but I'm not getting any of the things I'm looking for, only side effects I didn't have before or worsening effects.

I'm still early on in my treatment but I honestly just feel like not even pursuing it any further, and just deal with the issues like I have been for years.

Plus the risks worry me, cardiovascular risks, medication induced psychosis, worsening depression/anxiety etc. My resting heart rate is up 35-40bpm per day since taking this.

I still stay in Dade county, but now im a lot closer to the city. Anyways, I was able to confidently get my prescription monthly with little to no issues, but now that I moved, I havent been able to find any pharmacies that carry it. I understand that its scarce but everywhere I look they cant give me a time frame of how long it would take to arrive. The most info I received was from Costco, and since im a new patient there they said it would realistically take 1-2 months for me to get my prescription. I just want to know that I cant be the only one thats going through this. I havent been medicated since March 2025 and now I have to start all over from 10mg to work my way back up to 30mg.

2025-11-07 01:26:35;struggling in college & with medication;"Hi all, 

This is my first post on reddit. I'm 20f junior in undergrad (envi sci major), and I've been struggling much more than is typical for me lately. I've been diagnosed with ADHD for a while now, and more recently I've also been diagnosed with GAD, and I've tried a few different medications for both. 

Lately, though, my brain fog and executive paralysis has been so bad. Much worse than typical. I've just come off of 450mg of wellbutrin, which made me loose so much time and threw me into an executive dysfunction pit, so maybe this is leftover from that? I stopped taking that dose about a week ago, and I'm back at 300mg (I'm eventually going to switch and try vyvanse but I can't be unmedicated during the semester). I'm going to class etc, but doing literally any work outside of class is so exhausting, and often I just don't. I find that I don't have the energy to stress about grades, most of my anxiety is social in nature. 

I think this is in part to a very, very stressful semester, but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this before and has advice!";r/ADHD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oq537x/struggling_in_college_with_medication/
2025-11-07 01:24:43;Executive Dysfunction tips;"Hi all, I'm really looking for helpful tips to deal with, or at least start to deal with, executive dysfunction. 

I'm 21 now, got diagnosed at a pretty young age, and began taking medication then as well. I went to uni in 2023. At that point, my grandmother was helping me manage my medication. But she got sick and I dropped the ball. I got off all my medications and have been off them since. Being off my medications was disastrous, I actually left my uni and am now at a community college. The same things are happening and I dont know how to fix anything. 

I'm so anxious all the time, even thinking about opening my emails makes me want to throw up. I can barely will myself to go to class on time. I used to love school. 

I recently got a psychiatrist, and she started me on an antidepressant. She wants me to be level before starting me on anything else. I understand but the antidepressant really isnt helping with motivation like she said, and i have zero skills on how to deal with any of this. Are there any tips to help me until then?

2025-11-07 01:14:42;Feeling isolated sucks;"Im not sure if this is the perfect place to vent about this but im you guys would relate somehow.

It sucks that in the normal world people on default will not put an exception that some people have difficulty in the social scene. Why? Because thats rare and people are attracted toward familiarity.

I for instance have a horrible difficult unwanted issue that for the love of me haven't found either a clear diagnosis or something related maybe the closest is the adhd aspect.

I would be in a scene for instance two people joking around and talking about anything random. I will have a hard time decoding what i have heard and relating it to each other, and 99% id fail and will stumble when the conversation continue and new information has already occurred and i cant make sense of the first part so i try to forget it and continue but its repetead again with different topics.

Can someone tell me why my brain is like this? I tried to look for answers and i hoped that auditory processing disorder would be the hint for what im going's through but it wasn't sadly because my issue isnt ""mishearing words"" or its jumbled i can hear the words but i cant make sense of it.

Its like there is an input > (stuck in processing) > no output yet.

I feel very down and angry because people would either not get what im coming from or find people with the exact issue so i can feel relatable and secured that im not alone

But as crazy as it sounds i legit feel like im having an undiagnosed, rare condition that medical institutions never recognize it.

It sucks let me tell you that everyone can understand each other be quick and you are seen as a quiet introvert who is actually WANTING TO SOCIALIZE SO BAD but cant understand what people say so i just fake reactions because i dont want to be seen as dumb and stupid.

2025-11-07 01:14:32;Just got diagnosed;"I’m 27, and just got diagnosed today “with flying colors.” It’s something i’ve suspected for most of my life, but I was always brushed aside.
My mom, for example, would always say “you don’t have ADHD, you just didn’t try.”😮‍💨 Inna OFTEN got compared to my brother, who was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, and how “he really struggled.” 

Now I have so much relief, but there’s also …grief? for time lost? Years of cheating my way through elementary, middle, and high school because I never did my homework. Years of abusing substances to self medicate. Gaining weight and losing it repeatedly from binge eating. Time spent in the psychiatry unit in the ER, or in the psych ward.

I’m happy to be diagnosed. I’m proud to be neurodivergent. But I can’t help but wonder if things would have been different. I guess it’s not worth ruminating on.

My next appointment is in 2 weeks, and after that is my appointment for medication. Right now, i’m just laying in bed. It’s been so hard for me to be motivated to do anything.";r/adhdwomen;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oq4rqt/just_got_diagnosed/
2025-11-07 00:39:43;focalin vs other medications;so i (23F) got diagnosed with ADHD last month, and my psychiatrist put me on 5mg of focalin. she said if i feel no side affects to bump it up to 10mg. i ended up taking 10mg for 3 days and having increased anxiety and even a panic attack so i went back to five. in our meeting i had today she said to continue with the 5mg and see how it goes til our meeting next week. im wondering if any one had a similar experience and at what point does your psychiatrist switch to a whole other stimulant? im not saying that i think i need to switch, i probably just need to get used to it. but how bad does it have to get to be put on another stimulant? she told me there are a lot but im wondering how they choose which one u need. im on focalin because she said its less intense and a better introduction to stimulant medication. i asked her this question but i dont think i was specific enough and she was telling me about other medications i can take with the focalin for ocd and anxiety but didnt talk about stimulants other than focalin.  ;r/ADHD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oq3u4m/focalin_vs_other_medications/
2025-11-07 00:36:29;medication making me more social?;"Okay, so basically I am a 20 year old female who just started taking 30mg of Adderall IR once a day because I was diagnosed with ADHD recently. I have started to notice that I really enjoy engaging in conversations that I wouldn't really engage in otherwise during the time that my meds are in affect. 

Basically, I have a three hour gap in my workday and I sit in our hospitality room (I work at a community center) and do schoolwork. There are almost always this group of older guys (like grandfather ages) there at the same time as me and I really enjoy talking to them (part of it is me missing that grandpa conversation as one of my grandpas passed away in the spring of 24 and my other two live far away/aren't super talkative like my late grandpa was). It is always about stuff that I am also interested in and sometimes the guys ask me questions and I get sucked into conversation. Before taking meds, I did enjoy long conversations with people I know well and rambling/discussing topics that we all enjoy, but I didn't really like to start the conversation or engage much if it was people I don't know well. Because I started adding to these conversations with these guys before I started taking Adderall, I thought it possibly that I was just getting comfortable talking to them. However, today, I started up a conversation with one of the student teachers at work today who I have met in passing three or four times and never said much to. We ended up having a decent conversation though I had started with asking her some questions and then it was kinda a basic talk about college, early education, and the kids at work (because she's in the preschool room I used to be in). 

I'm just mainly concerned that Adderall is not right for me to take. 

On the other hand, I have seen the immense position effect that it has on me. I have always struggled with procrastination and changing tasks, however I have been able to focus and get so much more work done bc my brain quiets and I am not thinking of the million other things that I am interested in or want to think about and I am truly interested in the productive things that I want and need to get done. It even has helped my focus in the evenings after the dose has worn off because I don't feel the impending sense of doom I used to when I wasted all my time during the day and the impending doom caused me to push my work under the rug and just procrastinate to the point I just straight up didn't do it. I am actually passing my classes pretty easily now and that is a huge improvement considering I flunked out of college because I wasn't doing my work even though I knew the material (I also hate being a burnt out gifted kid with undiagnosed ADHD because why is life so hard). 

I think that being so concerned about it shows that I'm not abusing it but I also just want some advice and am wondering if this happens to anyone else. I did do a little bit of research and other people have said that they are more engaged in conversations when they take it so that might be it but I just wanted 

TLDR - Started taking Adderall and I want to have meaningful conversations with other way more than I used to so I want to know if this happens to anyone else because I'm worried being too talkative on Adderall is a sign that it's not right for me. (Important notes, I loved to talk before, I just had to warm up first and the conversations I've been having are all about things that I am passionate about, plus I have had a ton of good affects from the meds)";r/adhdwomen;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oq3r1d/medication_making_me_more_social/
2025-11-07 00:12:40;Good book recommendations?;"Hi everyone, 

I was diagnosed with ADHD this year which came as a bit of a shock. In hindsight, it makes total sense as I have always struggled with things which seemed to come naturally to others (organisation, attentiveness, finishing tasks etc). I recently started medication which has made a difference but I am still finding it difficult to keep on top of some of my more detail-oriented and time sensitive tasks at work. I have been quite hard on myself. Today I found myself asking 'am I broken? Why can't I
I do this one simple thing?' and got quite upset. Once I snapped out of it I realised the reason I am being so hard on myself is that I've spent my entire life trying to fit an expected mould and I actually don't understand how my ADHD brain works. 

Does anyone have any good books or other media recommendations so I can start learning more about ADHD? I know basic stuff but I think i need to do a real deep dive and get acquainted with my brain.

2025-11-06 23:25:30;Tonight We Cry Tears of Joy!;"Mannnnn where do I even begin?

I’m so relieved, I’m so happy and I’m so grateful. 

It’s been 15+ years of depression and anxiety, feeling worthless, mentally ill and like I was an imposter the whole time. Since I was a little boy I knew something was “different” about me. It’s been 3 years since one of my tutors at Uni told me “you ever thought about looking into ADHD?”. 

Took me 2 years to hand in that damn symptoms questionnaire. 

Just finished an MSc in psychology no less, with a 2:1 while finally beginning to piece together my symptoms and my onion of a brain. So many layers of trauma, masking, emotional dysregulation and pain 🧅.

But call me the motherfucking iron chef today because WE have finally cut through the bullshit to gain clarity. 

For months I suspected combined ADHD, with giftedness and possibly some mild autism. I was bang on the money; the autism is a possibility still but likely mild. 

It feels like I’ve won the lottery, I am no longer “mentally ill” and officially just a square peg in a round hole. Meaning there’s nothing wrong with me and there never was. It’s not our fault society can’t understand or accomodate for us. 

So hand me my fucking ADHD-C flair and let’s celebrate! Today is the first day of a new journey where I get to love myself, work with myself and stop trying to “cure” something that was never an ailment in the first place! 



PS:

I’m gonna make the best of my life now with acceptance, gratitude and love. I am gonna achieve every fucking goal. Topple every fucking obstacle. Not just for me. 

For all the people who lived and died being treated like an outcast for being different. Who never understood they were gifted. 

And for all the people yet to get a diagnosis, yet to educate themselves and yet to be their best selves - I salute you.

I only remember childhood trauma which was from year5/year 6 primary school up till high school. But again I only remember the trauma parts and nothing else. Like I can’t tell you my school teachers names and stuff like that.

I’m 23 years old and I thought it’s completely normal not to remember your childhood?? Like I was shocked when I heard people saying ‘oh yeah when I was 5 years old…’ LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 5??? Like you couldn’t even speak properly bro how do u remember stuff im so amazed. I’ve spoken to others who can only remember 10 years old and above etc. So I guess it does differ from each person? I can’t even tell you where I remember from like what age etc. I don’t even think I can remember being 18/19 years old, maybe just parts of it idk HELP😩🤣 and like someone may tell me something (most common example what job they do/how many kids they have) and then a few months later I’ll find myself re asking the question and people do get quite offended because they say they’ve already reminded me and then my response is ‘OMG I’M SO SORRY I DONT REMEMBER YOU TELLING ME OR REMINDING ME’ 😩😩but then I’m so weird because sometimes I remember things too like a specific conversation from 4 years ago I can repeat word for word. (Maybe i can only remember stuff that impacted me in a positive or negative way etc?)

Anyways, when I was getting my ADHD diagnosis (combined) and the clinician said I am displaying cognitive/memory issues and need to book another GP appointment for some tests. This conversation was 8 months ago and I still haven’t even been to doctors LMAOO typical adhd’er, however I think I deserve points for at least remembering its still outstanding, (not that I’m going to complete it anytime soon😭🙈)

So yeah my question is those with ADHD do you experience any similar issues around memory loss/forgetfulness? I know we all have the forgot this forgot that on a daily basis but I mean more of a deeper memories/childhood etc. If a few people reply and say no it’s not linked to ADHD/and they remember their childhood then I better run to the doctors because this is defo a serious dementia problem or something then idk😭💀";r/adhdwomen;7;7;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oq0m9l/do_you_remember_your_childhood/
2025-11-06 22:13:48;Post-burn out, I'm stuck and need help;"Hi there :)

I'm 33 and got diagnosed about 2 months ago. I went through burnout about 1,5 years ago and since my diagnosis, I hit a sort of slump. I had to move back to my parents because we separated with my live-in partner (29, diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago). The burnout was partly work, partly compensating for my partner. 

But since I got diagnosed, it's like I understand that everything I could do before led me to burnout and I can't seem to find a way to function at all. 
I used to be quite functional (on the outside), I had a job, my appartement was always clean (when I had people over at least), the area I always struggled was paperwork, but even that, I could manage.
Today, sending an email takes me hours, I can't manage to find a job (one application just drains me to the core). I feel like I'm not capable of existing as a human person anymore. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple weeks. I hope medication might help, but I haven't had it yet. I also have therapy every other week, but that doesn't seem to help, I just end up crying in my car for like an hour after each session.
I don't know what to do.

Did any of you experience a time like this after your diagnosis?
Do you have any tips to navigate and feel like a person again?

I got prescribed on Medikinet and take 30mg in the morning with a banana, then another 30mg at midday when eating.   
The effects are nice on a social aspect, I have a lot of  speech quirks that dim down, such as starting a sentence by the end of the sentence. Actually being able to translate my ideas into words clearly has been a blessing.   
Unfortunately I'm not sure if I'm really setting myself up right in terms of studying. I can't seem to channel myself to work on my classes (which is becoming kind of a problems as a lot of are approaching).   
I doodle on the pages, start cleaning my nails, sharpening pencils...just about anything but working  
Studying things that bore me is still pretty hard and I can't get much work done :/

Is it a medication thing or really just a lack of willpower ? any advice is really appreciated ! ";r/ADHD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1opy3pl/medication_tips/
2025-11-06 20:22:18;How do you manage intimacy and se*xual relations?;"The diagnosis helped me shed light on a lot of things, obviously, and just this week I wondered how ADHD impacts sex life and intimacy. Well, quite a lot, it turns out.

How do you experience this, and what's your advice, if any? Because this thing can absolutely *destroy* relationships. I know it has many of mine.

The TLDR of this here piece - [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-esteem/202210/how-adhd-influences-your-sex-life-and-intimate-relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-esteem/202210/how-adhd-influences-your-sex-life-and-intimate-relationships) \- hit home:

* New partner = sex is fun for a while but then becomes more repetitive = boring = death knell for the ADHD mind
* Wandering mind: doesn't matter if its work, going out, watching movies, etc., the mind wanders between the sheets too
* Thus the partner noticing that you're 'not present' (""not there"")
* Thus partner starting to feel insecure, thinking he/she is not enough -> detachment

I gotta say, really not looking forward to go out dating again and then having to give whoever I'm dating the low-down and the manual. I'd really understand if people would be like ""yeah that's too much hassle, I'm moving on"", which then translates to why bother trying to date anyone?

2025-11-06 19:48:48;Adderall vs Vyvanse Experiences;"Hi you all!!! I would love to hear your experiences on Adderall and/or Vyvanse. 

I have been on adderall since 2022. Starting adderall was LIFE CHANGING. I couldn't believe I was paying attention (lol), but little by little it has stopped working. I started on 10mg XR and then increase to 15mg XR. I haven't increased it because it was working well and I'm now working night shift and when I get home in the AM I want to be able to sleep and not be wired.

 I take my adderall before my shift start (I make sure it is not with anything citrus and no vitamin C) and is like if I dont take it. I'm even more distracted and daydreaming than before getting diagnosed and on medication and if we talk about productivity I can only say I have 0 productivity in my day to day. I feel like I'm taking it for taking it because it really is doing nothing. 

I have been researching about Vyvanse and it seems like it works for some and it doesn't work for others (like everything in ADHD lol) I know I have to talk to my provider, but since I lost previous coverage I lost my psychiatrist and with this new insurance have been really hard to get a psychiatrist, so the switch from adderall to vyvanse will have to be with my PCP and even though he is qualify I also want to hear other women's experiences. 

Thank you in advance for your responses :) <3";r/adhdwomen;2;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opwt2y/adderall_vs_vyvanse_experiences/
2025-11-06 19:29:45;New to Ritalin IR;"Hi everyone! So I just got diagnosed with ADHD and started meds. Started with extended release, but it's expensive, so 2 weeks later I switched to try the IR instead.   
  
It's been maybe 5 or so days on 10 + 10 mg of Ritalin IR 4 hrs apart. In the beginning I was getting bad anxiety symptoms at different times, but in all fairness, I'm in a stressful period of life and also neglected proper nutrition. Medikinet gave me similar side effects, which are mostly diminished now. Just slightly jittery for a second and my body temp feels warmer. But I have been eating well, sleeping well, going outside, my blood pressure and heart rate are normal.  
  
But I don't feel too much improvement? I struggle as many here with executive dysfunction and energy levels. And if I am completely honest, I am not sure how the titration with IR works. So my psych said that I should never take more than 10mg at once and she told me to not take it with less than 4 hours in between. Though I know some other psychiatrists tell people to take 15-20 and with smaller breaks if one metabolises it quickly.   
  
But my question is... if 10mg don't work, then I take 10 more mg that don't really work. How will it help to take 10 more 4 hours later if it won't do much? Where I live only Medikinet and Ritalin are prescribed. ";r/adhdwomen;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opwgt2/new_to_ritalin_ir/

I feel like my ADHD affects me as much as other people I know on PIP. 

I think I’ve largely been rejected due to my age. I’m 41 and was diagnosed at 39. I have read that older applicants find it harder to get awarded PIP.

I also think a factor is the UK cracking down on benefits in an effort to save money.

2025-11-06 17:57:59;New here - opinions and comments wanted :);"I apologise in advance for a super long post - I've been on this sub for the past few days, as over the last few months I've been wondering whether I might have ADHD. 

I've read some recent posts on here and do think ""that is exactly like me"" so I started to write a list of things that I do/feel that I wonder are they traits of someone with ADHD?

I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for by posting this - just some reassurance maybe? I appreciate that only a medical professional can give me a diagnosis but I think for me, writing this post will help me eventually go to speak to a doctor. 

For any context, I'm 32yrs old, married with a 2yr old son. I live in the UK and work part time for the emergency services.

Main issue -
My mind feels like its constantly going a million miles an hour. I cannot switch it off.  I often use the analogy that I've got 100's of tabs open, and they're all running something different at the same time. I cannot close them, I really want to but I just can't. I will joke with my husband that inside my head is chaos and his is like the toy monkey with symbols. 

These things do often come out of my head and I make constant ""to do"" lists on phone, but they rarely get completed. They can be really small insignificant things, but to me I need to keep them on a list so I will EVENTUALLY get round to doing it otherwise it will just bug me. But can also be bigger things that I would LOVE to get done, but somehow I just can't get round to doing them. For example, I really want to put some wedding photos on the wall in our house but still haven't done this. My husband and I have been married for 6 years now... I did get one step closer last year by buying some frames, but they've just sat on the table still in the wrapping for months and months. 

I always feel like there's something that needs doing round the house, something that needs buying, fixing, sorting, tidying, cleaning etc. and the idea of all of these things going round my head sometimes make me feel like I want to explode. I have no trouble getting on with things, but it's a constant battle of feeling like everything needs to happen all the time all at once. 


Hobbies;
I've always been very conscious of the fact that I don't really have a hobbie. I imagine being in an awkward work situation where someone asks me ""what do you do outside of work for fun"" and I literally don't know what to say. My husband has tried to help me start things but I never seem to pick them up and run with them, or I start them and never go back to them. A few years ago, I started some cross stitch but it's half finished in a cupboard somewhere. I started a jigsaw a few weeks ago, but I spent one evening doing it and haven't gone back. I would really love to!! But I always feel like there are other things that need doing first and take priority. 


Social;
I've never been the most extravert person or someone who has enjoyed social situations. I HATE making small talk, particularly with people I don't know very well and I hate having to meet new people. I just assume everyone is always judging me and they won't like me. I don't have a large friendship circle and majority of my closest friends now are people I've met through my husband. I didn't keep in touch with anyone from school or university and feel like a failure because of this. I had one close friend from school who completly ghosted me back in April and I have no idea why. (That's another whole story!) But of course I assume it's because I've done something wrong. 


Lastly, I've never felt like these issues have effected my work. I work in a high pressured busy environment (largely computer/tech based) and I consider myself to be highly organised and efficient. I always meet deadlines and get tasks completed quickly and to a high standard. I suppose I feel like a different person at work in a way. 


If you've got to the end of this post, thank you!! All opinions and comments welcome :) ";r/adhdwomen;1;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opuwy9/new_here_opinions_and_comments_wanted/
2025-11-06 17:37:45;Am I just dumb? :/;"Sorry for my english, it‘s not my native Language (But I have diagnosed ADHD)

Lately I just feel dumb and empty. I‘m in school and i just won‘t run as it usually does. I would consider me as a smart Person and sometimes someone says that I am but nothing works. A lot of things are happening but mostly emotional topics. Even my english feels like I vomit english and autocorrect just doesn‘t help it just puts translates into my mother tongue (But that‘s not the Point). I just ask myself: Did I just turned dumb because I didn‘t took care of myself enough and didn‘t study enough (I got into a higher school but the subjects aren‘t the Problem). I just didn‘t and don‘t focus enough on school and that Shows in my grades.

The emotional subject are for example that i struggeled with Depression/ depressive Phase lately and my girlfriend broke up (she was the person who made my head quiet). And now everything feels empty and numb. And I don‘t really care about anything. And the emptiness is too much. I don‘t know what defines me as a Person. Everything is just so messed up. And I ask myself: How or why do others accept me because i often feel to be too much and too dumb

Sorry for my horrible structure and the jumping between the subjects. Things i‘ve wanted to write have I already forgotten. I try to it structure better: A lot is going on - i feel dumb - question: am i just dumb and unconsciously seek validation or is it normal?

I‘m sorry to write a whole bible. I Hope you can understand what I mean and can help  
Have a great day ;)

Edit: I remembered what i wanted to say: But this school year is important which regularly doesn‘t count but i will make an exchnage year and because of this school is important. Maybe im just a dumb guy who can‘t get his life under control.

2025-11-06 15:58:55;Can a more simple and less accomplishment-oriented life help with productivity?;"29 M

I was diagnosed 2 years ago, also with generalized/social anxiety 4 years ago. Maybe autism too, but never went for a test. 

I reached a point where I feel quite good at my job, I rent my own place, and I can handle my own things.

My problem is that after work I struggle to be consistent with the rest of my things. 

The ideal day looks like this:

Work.

Groceries - only when I need.

Exercise - every day (Short sessions only, and I do it for fun, like one day I do some rucking, other day I do some bouldering, third day I train core, some days I just go for a walk or I stretch, but I need it every day, it makes me feel good. Mornings are not gonna work).

Shower.

Cook dinner.

Eat.

Cook lunch for the next day (I eat it at work).



This is not so much, and yet I struggle with it. The part I absolutely hate is the cooking part, despite making simple stuff like omelettes, salads, frying meat... and other chores too, like laundry, washing dishes. When I start it, I have momentum, it's not that hard, but often I struggle to start.

And I am not even tired, I have the energy to do it, actually it would be good for me, since I sit a lot at my work, standing up when cooking feels good, and yet I fail consistently. That is one thing I am consistent with, failing.

2025-11-06 15:57:02;Work Failure;"(This post is automatically translated)
Hi everyone, m22 I discovered 4 months ago that I have ADHD and with the diagnosis the phrase that has always been repeated to me ""you start more than well, but you screw it all up in the end"", has taken on a meaning and also some relief let's say.
Beyond the lack of effectiveness in state care, due to lack of funds, I always find myself falling back into this problem. I am an electrical designer, I reached this role with a tenth of the required experience thanks to my ease and obsessive attention to detail, I have always been assigned very complex jobs to myself rather than to people with more experience, because I have always gotten away with it. My problem? I always make the same, endless, banal mistakes. We're not talking about serious errors from a technical or functional point of view, but in fine works, I hyper-perfect many things, others have stupid errors that don't influence the final work, but since there are many, they are a real pain in the ass. For this reason I find myself, once again, having my contract not renewed and having to look for a new job. I'm tired of my ""inattention"" always tarnishing my professionalism, of constantly coming into the office 5/10/15 minutes late nullifying the hours of overtime I work.

Ive been diagnosed recently and have been on rubifen for 2 weeks now.

Its been really good for keeping me motivated and focused and helping with my food noise.

However ive been making minor f ups at work. I have a beauty salon and ive been missing minor things i wouldnt have usually missed. Tint colors, brows not being perfectly even etc etc

The f ups have all fallen under this 2 week cycle and im worried because im not all over the show being more hyperaware and pedantic, that ive started to unconsciously become a bit careless? I dont believe thats the case but I dont know what else to put it down to.

2025-11-06 14:10:55;Being told not to cry...;"I've never understood why people will say, ""Don't cry,"" as if I have a choice! I guess maybe people without ADHD DO have a choice? I wasn't ""allowed"" to cry as a child, so, in turn, I run away & hide if I'm crying. It's my instinct. Now that I've been diagnosed, I'm trying to sort of deprogram myself in a way to allow myself to stop masking & just be. I know it's going to be a lot of work. 

I just realized that my husband has continued (unknowingly) to inflict the same pain that my mom inflicted growing up. As soon as he sees any tears, his first response is, ""No, don't cry!"" He has been reinforcing the idea of not being allowed to cry this entire time. It's a whole cycle. I try to be open with him about something going on with me, but he is very unresponsive. I feel rejected. I make a comment (in a somewhat snarky manner) about bothering or annoying him, he gets upset, I start to cry, he says ""don't cry,"" and then I can no longer cope with the situation.

Just a rant, don't really know why, other than I've locked myself in my office (without my phone) until I stop crying and my computer is in here. I just thought you all might understand I guess.

2025-11-06 13:46:35;I'm at my wits end;"Male, 20 yrs. 

Sem 1 of college, on paper, went well; good grades, I even made the Deans List. Went to parties, made friends, and I was pretty trim at 210 lbs. lovely. The cracks started to show at the end of the semester, when i stopped tracking my calories and began to rely on outside help or even outsourcing my work to friends because I couldn't be bothered.

I was a slug during my winter recess. Played video games all day into the early morning, slept as long as I was allowed, often into the early afternoon then do it all over again, save on workdays.

Things began crumbling in Sem 2. I attended my classes little more than half the time, but began relying on non-human sources to help pick up some of the academic slack. I stopped working on my physical health entirely and only went to one or two parties. My relationship with my mother got so strained because of my forgetfulness, 'laziness', irresponsibility, etc., that I realized I needed help, so I began to meet with a university counselor. By the end of the year, they were fairly certain I had ADHD, but couldn't diagnose me, so they advised I pursue diagnosis over the summer.

After 10 weeks of kicking my feet, getting blood work, and receiving recommendations, I finally took an online assessment and was officially diagnosed with ADHD and an unspecified depressive disorder, likely linked to the ADHD. Yay.

I began taking 30mg Vyvanse, but when my mom discovered it cost almost $200 a fill, we both agreed I'd switch to Adderall. I had one glorious day with Vyvanse, then the rest was meh. The 20mg Adderall has only ever really helped my brain fog. Not much else.

This semester is San Andreas. I do what I did during that winter recess, but skipping **most** of my classes. I barely take my Adderall and scarcely see my friends. I'm up 70lbs and I catch my shotgun and shells whispering about a two man every once in a while. I don't know what to do, hope tank is on E.

2025-11-06 12:42:58;"Mild ADHD + Social Anxiety ; From Meds to Supplements";"I'm a 26M diagnosed as a mild ADHD person. I was basically suffering majorly from executive distinction and severe anxiety.

after diagnosis, my doctor prescribed be ritalin 10mg at morning. Oh my gosh! such an incredible experience it was! but not for more that 5 days, at my day 5, i was listening to upbeat music and i clearly remember, at that very moment severe anxiety started. at last we have to calm it down by amitriptyline hydrochloride 5mg at night.

Ritalin went well for 3 months straight until it became so much intolerable due to severe anxiety.

my doctor changed it to Strattera 20mg. it totally was an weird drag to be honest. took long time to adjust. worked some on my rizz level but has so many weird functions on sex drive , functionality and libido. anyways, stopped it after 6 months

Then my doctor totally changed the ADHD category med. He prescribed me escitalopram oxalate 5 mg at morning. It totally vanished all my social anxieties tbh. became so social and a rizz farmer tbh xD. but it also had a saturation point on me within 6 months. so i had to leave it as well.

Then tried Ashwagandha. it has almost similar kind of impact as escitalopram on me. but it also needs cycling on me so that it doesn't get saturated. if i don't cycle it, it gets saturated by 2 months.

One important thing is if i become socially good, it takes my task initiation and ability to work for longer periods away. it i get the other things, it takes my ability to become social away.
I also tried Saffron extract 30mg. it's not worth trying.

Currently on L-tyrosin 500mg. I take it eventually. works good for me. but it's not an everyday tool to be honest.

Besides all these, I hit gym 3-5 days a week. try to maintain schedule everyday.

I wish i could get my first 7 days back with ritalin 10mg for life. That was so miraculous.

Im in an advanced school and this is my senior year, i can see the results of all those years i crammed; i've never failed an exam before but now im failing ALL THE QUIZZES, idk how to study bcs i never really did that, adding to it that i lack the foundation from past years bcs i almost remember nothing from that material, im trying to not stress myself much bcs i cant afford to get depressed again.

Im pressured by my own dreams and everyone’s expectations. I feel like im supposed to be more mature, yet I still need my mom to remind me to brush my hair or do simple stuff. Staying in dorm and seeing everybody study 24/7 just makes me feel worse about myself, i feel like im just a messy chaotic irresponsible kid compared to them, idk how my parents think its nothing, looking at my 10yo sister and looking at me, the difference cant be overlooked.

It feels like the harder i try the more im proven its helpless, like this just wont ever change. I've started thinking about simply giving up bcs im no longer that ""smart"" girl i used to be.. dude i cant even balance a SIMPLE chem equation like a 9th grader thats ridiculous

And could not grasp why exactly I dont feel like ADHD impairs my life to a significant degree, even though, symptomatically, it seems my impairment would be on high-end of ADHD and considered devastating by many.   
  
I dont take any medications. So cant be quality of medicated management.   
  
And then a little theory hit me, I have spent years since teen years studying professional and medical grade psychiatry and perhaps I could attribute some of my approach to life-related challenges to that.

So I'm curious:

2025-11-06 11:51:29;Has getting on medication ever made you “too productive” at work?;"I’ve had ADHD my whole life, diagnosed in 7th grade. I took medication in middle school to the start of high school but have been off of it until the last couple weeks - I’m 33 now. 

I’m a software developer and I work from home. I work for my state’s government so there aren’t really deadlines and work can be slow sometimes. I’ve had the same job for 3 years and I’ve done fine at work but not exceptional. My contract always gets renewed but I’m definitely not an overachiever. 

In the last couple weeks that I’ve started taking medication again I’ve been locked in. I complete tasks quickly and move on to the next one right away. Before I would sometimes milk tasks since I knew there wouldn’t be any more work if I finished too quickly. 

Anyways, I feel like my production recently has been too much, more than what the job requires. Am I overthinking this or has anyone ever became “too productive” for their own good at work?

2025-11-06 11:36:52;The real dark side.;"So for a couple of years now I have been diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, and this post is about the really dark side of it all.

When I was about 15, before i was diagnosed when I was 18, I used to get thoughts about hurting people around me. It didnt matter who you were or how close you were to me, I'd still get these thoughts... these thoughts sometimes could be incredibly graphic sometimes and it would scare the sh*t out of me.

Annoyingly now 6 - 7 years later, they're back. They still scare me the same way, and I just keep telling myself it's my mind running away like a virus.

The fact my own thoughts scare me is a good thing I think. 

When I went for my therapy before I was diagnosed I was told that this is a normal thing with ADHD and ASD but I don't belive it myself

2025-11-06 11:36:02;3-4 hour evaluation for diagnosis?;"I don't have any official diagnosis but my GP has been treating my ADHD and depression for the last 5ish years. My husband got a new job and because my GP's office was a health clinic tied to that insurance/employer I have to find a new provider. New job has a similar health clinic model. The new Dr/NP told me that I would have to get a formal diagnosis for her to continue to prescribe my Vyvanse. She said she'd send in a referral and to be aware that the evaluation is very long. She said something like half a day and the nurse came in and said something like 3-4 hours.

Does this sound familiar to anyone for their formal diagnosis? I'm wondering what to expect and although I am very confident I'm ADHD Im having serious imposter syndrome and a little freaked at the possibility of being booted from my meds that I have come to depend on.

2025-11-06 11:13:19;Problems focusing and following conversations;"I have ADHD and have a question

I was recently ""diagnosed"" with ADHD - history of cognitive issues and complaints that the voices/noise/music/bells in my head were very annoying and making current issues even more difficult. My roommate suggested that *might* be ADHD so I took a few questionaires on psychology websites (ADHD Self Report Score) and it matched with ADHD-I

I took this info to my family doctor started me on Vyvanse which had no positive effects after 3 weeks, so we swapped to Methylphenidate HCL.

I recently had an increase to the medication and the voices/noise/music/bells channels that were constantly playing and swapping out are almost gone (wow it is soo quiet it in here), but now I have a different problem.

It is soo quiet (which is amazing, never been this quiet - I am 55 and it has always been loud, but I thought **all** brains were like this), I am noticing not a lot is going on. I still find concentrating difficult, following topics difficult (including normal conversations), not noticing things I should that are right in front of me and very obvious and even reading (has been a problem for a while - my brain starts to blur after too many words). 

Does this mean I am on the right track for meds, but not quite? Sadly with my family doctor I have to be a very active participant in my treatment plans.";r/ADHD;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1opny8s/problems_focusing_and_following_conversations/
2025-11-06 11:06:12;Is it true that some people don’t have a constant inner monologue;"I don’t have an official ADHD diagnosis because I was a high achiever in high school, but in my opinion I have a lot of symptoms. The two that impede most with my life is 1) rarely feeling the satisfaction of doing something to completion, like never being able to have the house fully clean because I can never finish one task to the point where all the cleaning equipment is put away etc and then move onto the next one, I kind of do everything to 80% but theres like mess from the unfinished tasks 😅 at first I thought it was laziness but even when I am really trying I still manage to somehow either do two at once or alternate between tasks and it just creates more mess 

2) probably the worst symptom that I find to be embarrassing is my inability to say a clear linear sentence or be able to communicate something clearly even though in my head it feels like a very clear and coherent idea. Like at university I felt so dumb because people would look at me like I was speaking in Klingon but I had no clue what was so unclear about my speech. I am very grateful to have friends who understand what I am saying though. 

 Anyway I just saw on a YouTube short from an ADHD account that it’s a symptom of ADHD to always have a constant internal monologue and that not everyone has this? I never knew that some people actually think about nothing. Even if I’m focused on something I’m doing with my hands, I’ll likely be counting my hand movements or something like that. It doesn’t ever really turn off even if I’m focused on what’s happening externally. Is this a symptom of ADHD?

2025-11-06 10:47:44;Feeling like I’ve lived in the context of ADHD for too long.;"As eye-opening as it was to discover my lifelong struggle with productivity was ADHD all along, I can’t help but feel like this awareness has excused, normalized, or, ironically, enabled my difficulties further. Before knowing it was ADHD, I never liked to speak in terms of “my brain” (“**My brain** is keeping me from doing my homework,” “I know how to do it, but **my brain** won’t let me put words on the page,” etc.). Saying it like that always sounded to me like I wasn’t taking proper responsibility for my actions—positioning my brain as this separate entity who’s to blame for keeping me in chains—and I feared that by habitually phrasing it like that, I’d normalize my issues and never get over them.

Well, after discovering it *was* ADHD all along, I guess my brain really *was* a separate entity keeping me in chains.

I still try to maintain parts of the whole “responsible for my own actions” mindset, but it’s getting harder since I began living in the context of ADHD. Since my diagnosis, I find myself silently normalizing my ADHD-related problems. They’re still present (albeit sometimes mitigated thanks to meds), but I often catch myself before almost saying “I have ADHD, so I procrastinate a lot and have little to no regard for allotted time-lengths and due dates.” I feel like, instead of this audaciously acceptive voice, I should speak in a corrective voice, like “I know I shouldn’t have procrastinated this—that was poor time management on my part. I take full responsibility for my actions, and I am working to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”

…


hey so after writing that, i’m now wondering if I’ve been conditioned by parents and authority all my life to believe i have no excuse and no one to blame but myself for working slowly and falling behind.

at what point is ADHD no longer an excuse? at what point do we have to just suck it up and stop languishing in our symptoms? at what point is it “me” and not “my ADHD”?

2025-11-06 10:23:09;Weird feelings about my diagnosis;"Hi, 18f. 
I've been diagnosed with ADHD a while ago and I have weird feelings around the whole thing. Firstly neither me nor my doctor are 100% convinced. Diagnosis doesn't ring true for me. Like so much of the ADHD experience feels not like me. 
Im like really? ADHD? For a while I overthought everything and believed I could have it but I don't think so anymore. I worry I've downplayed or exaggerated something; reading over my report Im like how did I say that? Kinda inaccurate. Parents want to go down the supplements and therapy route. I seek validation that I display ADHD traits, because everything I do feels normal. I don't really believe I have it but Im dreading  my instincts being right. Note: my parents are not fully convinced either. I need to be out of dx limbo

2025-11-06 10:18:21;I think I did something really bad or really good- need advice;"I’ll try to make this short- and blur some details just in case someone from work is on this group.

Recently work has been trash. Lots of changes and uncertainty, lack of structure, lack of role clarity (3 managers in the last 5 months).

I’m usually very good at masking but with all this I’m finding it really hard to stay regulated (I suspect I may be ASD too, but haven’t seek a diagnosis for that).

Few things have happened, including me having to move desks and my desk being too bright and managers only paying attention after a meltdown. And then manager said in a team meeting that I get a different desk because I have special needs.

I’ve been getting comments that I speak out of turn or I’m too sharp on my feedback. And then I’m a senior in my team and I tried mentoring someone who is also ADHD and was accused of favouritism and my manager didn’t back me up.

Add to that the general expectation of showing up at work always cool as a cucumber and I’m always feeling called out and criticised for things I can’t help.

So, my boss - who is a nice person, just has no idea what to do- is on holiday and I spoke to the HR manager about this because she’s friendly with me. My goal was to ask for training for my manager and team, but I think the HR manager is freaking out a bit and talking about formal grievances.

What do I do know when my manager returns? I don’t want it to look like I went behind her back. But I also need her to understand that she can’t hold me to the same standards as everyone else because I just can’t do it. Extra info, I’ve been working here for years and have always been a great employee, it’s only in the last 6 months I’ve been struggling.

2025-11-06 09:31:18;How is Bipolar + ADHD treated?;"For context: I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 (recently), Anxiety, and OCD, but I've always suspected I could have ADHD.

Recently, my Therapist said she's starting to notice more symptoms than just Bipolar, OCD, and Anxiety, and that it seems to her I could maybe have ADHD. I got scared since all this time I thought my problems would be over once the Bipolar medication started having effect (started a mood stabilizer today, with nothing else to go along with for now - I've tried antipsychotics, but the side effects were horrible in my experience). As far as I know, people with Bipolar cannot be on Stimulants since it increases the risk of Mania/Hypomania.

So it got me questioning. In cases like this. What should a person with both ADHD and Bipolar do to treat themselves? I've heard there are medications other than Stimulants that can treat ADHD, is it true? and do those go well alongside Bipolar?

I'm followed by professionals, a therapist and a psychiatrist. I'm not requesting a diagnosis. Just hypothesizing out of curiosity, what could be done in a case like this (in which the person has the full diagnosis of Bipolar + ADHD), what questions should one bring up to their doctors, and what is known and has been studied by professionals about this matter.";r/ADHD;1;11;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oplqbv/how_is_bipolar_adhd_treated/

I am not diagnosed with ADHD, but I think my problem overlaps so I am hoping for advice. 

I do evening classes at my university in a language. I need the teacher to write a good reference for me to get a job next year. The other academic people in my life are not good options because I'm always late to things, whereas I've been relatively on time to this french class and it's more related to the job I'm applying for. 

I want to look professional. However, I get these bursts of like restless energy and the class is 2 hours long, so I find it hard to stay still for the whole thing. I can't help moving. Fidgeting with a pen, doodling, bouncing my leg, or literally just dancing in my seat. And it's ridiculous. I try not to bounce my leg because it drives me out of my mind when other people do it. 

Furthermore, the more restless I get, the more easily I show my frustration. Saying stuff like ""je n'en ai aucune idée"" and I know as a tutor that's really annoying for a teacher. And I lose control of my tone, so you can hear my frustration. 

I am typically someone with good control over how I express myself and these classes are important, but I'm struggling here. What do I do? How do I get rid of the feeling? ";r/adhdwomen;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opljo5/cant_stay_still_in_lessons_but_i_need_a_reference/

I’m very social  however I can also be reserved , especially under stress or on my pills. Usually when things are regulated in my life I have a neat and clean space , mostly organized.

2025-11-06 08:42:55;Social anxiety and rejection sensitivity have been worse - could it be Vyvanse?;"Hi all, 26F who finally got diagnosed with ADHD this year after a long process. It's been validating, I guess, but my main purpose for getting diagnosed was to try medication. I've always been extremely disorganised and forgetful, had poor time management, had trouble staying on task, finding motivation to do things, I've been very rejection sensitive, struggled with social anxiety and self-confidence, difficulty paying attention in conversations and when being instructed, constantly restless and fidgety ... etc. 

I got put on 20mg of Vyvanse about 3 months ago and when I first started to take it I felt a slight kick, but felt like it wore out so quickly, like 1.5 hours after I felt the kick. My psych then put me on 50mg and initially I liked that a lot more; I felt the rush when it kicked in, felt like I could handle rejection easily and became more outspoken; I could smash out work tasks and felt a mild euphoria. It's been about 2 months now and while I really have liked it, I've noticed a few issues for me: mainly sleep (which is a bit better with melatonin and magnesium glycinate), and I've noticed that I'm really awkward in conversations and overthink interactions a lot. I feel like I have less to say or almost less personality and I've become more avoidant with my interactions? Is this a known side effect of vyvanse? I have also started vaping again unfortunately so it could be attributed to that.

The reason I ask I guess is because I have my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow and I don't want to jump the gun with a new medication because initially I did really like vyvanse and I still like how I tend to remain focused and not overthink during the day, and the above issues could be attributed to other things but I'm just sick of feeling like I'm not myself and would appreciate any advice from people who have been in a similar situation.";r/ADHD;2;7;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1opknpm/social_anxiety_and_rejection_sensitivity_have/
2025-11-06 08:25:13;New Inattentive ADHD diagnosis, and 30 mg Vyvanse not working;"Hello, 

I am a 22 year old female newly diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. I was initially given a 30 day trial dose of Adderall 10 mg. I took the first dose before class, and was hit with a wave of fatigue. I was extremely tired and unable to stay awake in the classroom. It took me a while to find the courage to try the med again. I didn’t feel any different when reattempting the meds later on. I suspect I have a sleep disorder as I do suffer from chronic fatigue. I get plenty of sleep often 12 hours or more. I can wake up briefly in the morning and fall right back asleep until 1 pm and honestly keep sleeping. When I was diagnosed I was given a 30 mg Vyvanse prescription. It’s day 3, and I feel no changes. I have taken the med at 12:30 pm with 2 eggs and toast plenty of water, by 2 pm I’m yawning and ready to nap. I have taken the med at 2:30 pm same meal, and again I am yawning and actually took a nap. I have no problem sleeping at night taking it this late in the day as it doesn’t seem to do anything. I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and has suggestions outside of talking to my doctor.

2025-11-06 07:53:06;Medication;"Hi everyone,

I’m 19 and was diagnosed with ADHD (along with depression, anxiety, ODD, and RSD) when I was 15.

I’ve been on Vyvanse since my diagnosis, and I take Lexapro (previously Fluoxetine) for mood. Vyvanse works really well for me in most ways, focus, motivation, etc but I still really struggle with emotional regulation, especially anger. Whenever I feel sad, hurt, disappointed, tired, or overstimulated, it all comes out as anger. RSD honestly feels unbearable at times, and I just wish I could react like a normal person.

It’s made friendships, especially with other girls my age, really difficult because I get confused and overwhelmed so easily. I’ve worked really hard to manage it and have made some progress, but it still massively affects my relationships with my family and my boyfriend. I feel like such a mean person sometimes, even though I know I’m not trying to be. 

I’m hoping someone out there can relate and maybe share if any medications have helped with emotional regulation or anger. I’ve done therapy, grounding techniques, and try to remove myself from triggering situations, but it’s getting really hard, and the people I care about are the ones who end up hurt.

I see my psychiatrist twice a year (coming up soon), and I’d love to go in with some ideas to discuss. He’s great, but he doesn’t have a lot of experience with girls who have ADHD and anger/RSD issues. So if anyone can share what’s worked for them especially meds that helped “take the edge off” emotionally — I’d really appreciate it.

I'm not a textbook case and have always done well in school but now that I am in college I'm really struggling sitting through long lectures and not zoning out in subjects I'm not interested in.

Then I started using 30 mg of Vyvanse. 

Though my life has been chaotic as I'm an RA this semester (Free Housing) and did the process of recently joining Greek Life this semester. Even, with that I went to a 4-week ADHD and Executive Functioning workshop by my university (before being officially diagnosed) and have started getting set up with accommodations and been using a university academic coach. I've been trying wearing watches and doing to-do lists and trying to study with others and I keep being told I'm doing the right thing but I'm still struggling and this semester. 

I keep missing classes being distracted on my phone in the morning (due to Reddit, YouTube, and News Apps which I keep deleting and redownloading), also that I keep feeling shame for a messy room and a buildup of laundry, while being consistently late as an RA who's supposed to be a role model. 

I just keep getting distracted and my life just sucks I'm behind on so many assignments and papers and I keep letting my professors down. On top of it with 3 weeks left in the semester I feel screwed because my grades are probably so bad (at this point I'm too scared to do the math and check). Plus, if I get below a 3.0, I lose my scholarship which makes my school affordable. 

I just feel like I'm getting so many chances and wasting them :(

Anyone have any advice to turn my life around in the next few weeks and if things go okay prepare for next semester?

I was diagnosed in my late 20s and have been medicated for about 5 years, but my life feels just as out of control as it always has. And I feel just as demotivated and unable to make change, despite trying numerous medications and being in therapy. I know all the things I should be doing- setting timers, making lists, breaking it down into smaller chucks, etc. but my brain just can’t do it… my brain constantly shuts down at the thought of even trying to do something aside from being totally checked out. It feels overwhelmingly exhausting just to think half the time. I just feel ashamed that I have put so much into therapy and psychiatric visits and everything just to feel like I haven’t changed at all.;r/ADHD;3;8;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1opfwf5/feeling_defeated/

2025-11-06 04:57:08;(Probable) ADHD and hypothyroidism - suddenly way too much energy;"Hi everybody! I'm experiencing something kind of strange and looking for some insight in case anyone here has experienced anything similar. I tried to speak to my doctor but he blew me off saying everything is fine. 

So, background: I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a couple of years ago and was told I had likely had it for a long time before I got checked out. I got medication, but really struggled to remember to take it. I'm currently being assessed for ADHD and based on my symptoms and traits and the conversations with the psychologist, it seems pretty likely that I have it (I'd think probably inattentive type). We're evaluating autism afterwards which it also seems fairly like that I might have, though I obviously don't know yet. I've had mild depression pretty much my whole life, with some periods being much worse. 

What's been happening in the last week or so is that I suddenly have lots more energy, so much so that it's worrying me. I've been more depressed than usual over the past couple of years and have had very little energy and drive. Now it's totally shifted. 

Some examples: 

* A lot more energy in general, feel like I have to do things all the time, struggling to sit still. I've had some heart palpitations too but not much
* Feeling restless and wired, getting more done than usual, cleaning a lot. I never related to the ADHD symptom of feeling like you have an internal motor and have to just keep going but now I get it
* Feeling lighter and in a much better mood in general (this part is good obvs, but weird out of the blue)
* I do way more in the gym without really trying (I usually do about 250-300 kcal on the elliptical, now I'm suddenly doing 600-700)
* I feel like my ADHD symptoms are worse than normal - like forgetting things, having lots of thoughts/things I want to do at once, being impulsive etc
* This part is kind of TMI so I'm hiding it: >!suddenly very high libido. Generally I'm pretty normal but sometimes can go weeks or even a couple of months without having an interest in sex, now I'm suddenly insatiable!<
* I've always struggled with insomnia but now it's worse, but I feel like I'm able to survive much better on little sleep now than I usually do

I recently figured out a system for taking my Levaxin so that I've remembered it almost every single day for about the past 2-3 months. I googled a bit and figured out that some of the symptoms above could be explained by the thyroid dose being too high, but when I brought it up with my doctor he just said I'm fine and there's no need to worry. 

Has anyone experienced similar? Is it the thyroid dose that should be lowered, or is this something else? Could it be that my hormone levels now being better is just such a shock to my system that I suddenly feel super energised by comparison, but it's actually normal? Maybe the hormonal imbalance and depression contributed to my ADHD symptoms being lessened? Or could it be that I actually have BPD (I've wondered before) and this is some kind of mild manic period? 

I'm just so confused and would really appreciate thoughts or input from anyone that knows what might be going on. ";r/adhdwomen;3;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opeyzi/probable_adhd_and_hypothyroidism_suddenly_way_too/
2025-11-06 04:30:12;Immediate VS Extended Release;I was diagnosed with ADD during my first year in college. Starting out my psychiatrist only wanted to prescribe extended release meds. It was horrible! I couldn't sleep at night & woke up very tired in the morning, it would cause blurred vision, also a tingling dizzy feeling like I was going to pass out & did on some occasions, neasua/vomiting, nightmares, etc. Eventually I got a new doctor and explained my situation and I've been on immediate release every since. I take 60mg a day of immediate release generic Adderall. For me, immediate release is effective for about 2-4hrs a dose. I break up two 30mg pills to make four 15mgs & take one every 2-4hrs. It does not cause any of the issues I mentioned above. At least thats my experience with extended vs immediate release. Idk if its just a me thing or if others have had similar issues.

2025-11-06 04:23:42;How long did it take for you to find a medication that works?;"I (35f) was recently diagnosed with primary inattentive ADHD in January, after suspecting I have it for at least a decade.

I tried increasing the dose, but it only made me feel flat and tired with a dry mouth, and now I think I need to try something else yet again.

How long did it take for you to find the medication that worked best for you, and how did you know it was working optimally? I don’t think the dose I’m on is *not* working, but I also am not sure. I know that I’m doing better than I was, but my brain is still noisy, the next dose up was too much, and I really don’t have a frame of reference for how I’m supposed to feel on medication.

2025-11-06 04:18:47;DAE smoke 🍃 instead of taking stimulants?;hi girlies. i (25F) tried taking stimulants when i first got diagnosed a few years back, but at that time i was going through some bad family stuff and dealing with dissociative symptoms. the meds made it worse so i stopped. i’ve been smoking weed a loooong time, sometimes problematically sometimes not, and find that it can help me to focus and relax. it’s almost like it helps me modulate my sensory experience so im not under or over stimulated. one downside though is i can get too comfortable being bored and doing nothing. but for me that’s better than sensory overload and burnout. i’m curious if anyone else who’s unmedicated has a similar experience where cannabis helps (or at least masks) adhd struggles.;r/adhdwomen;17;43;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opdxku/dae_smoke_instead_of_taking_stimulants/
2025-11-06 04:13:53;Sleepiness + ADHD;"Hi everyone, 

I’m currently going through the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD in the UK, which is taking super long because of the insane wait times. While I wait, I’ve noticed myself struggling more with what I believe are symptoms? One thing that’s been particularly difficult is sleeping by that I mean I literally fall asleep anywhere I find boring. This happens in bus, church and even class. I think it's due to me not being to keep my brain awake? I feel like this might be linked to ADHD, but I’m not totally sure. I’m also not sure what I can do to manage it while I wait for my diagnosis, especially in situations where I can’t exactly leave or take a break when I get bored.

2025-11-06 03:55:15;Recently diagnosed and trying to figure out my medication;" First off, congratulations to me for finally getting diagnosed. It took a lot of mistakes, money, talking to the wrong people, and time because I accidentally booked my psychiatrist three weeks out instead of the next day. But here I am! 35 and finally diagnosed with adhd inattentive type. It feels like a key fitting into a lock. On one hand, it’s weird because I feel like everything that makes me unique and weird that I couldn’t explain to normal people, ended up being almost stereotypical adhd symptoms. So I’m wrapping head around this diagnosis and feeling so unseen for my entire childhood. I wasn’t lazy! I didn’t just “love procrastination” like my mother said. I have had to learn a million ways to do things, which I’ve cobbled together over the years, so that my brain which is unable to remember and keep tasks in order, can work. 

I am excited and scared about having medication to help me with my executive dysfunction. It’s my biggest hurdle at work. I know how to do my job and how to break it down into manageable tasks in a best order to get things done. I can juggle the team meetings I need to schedule and create internal deadlines so the final product has time for review before delivery to the client. But sometimes (a lot of the time!!!!) I would procrastinate to the last minute to start my tasks and make it so hard on myself for no reason. Like, I couldn’t get myself to work through my todo list until I was sufficiently stressed out to get it done and then I would have to put in a bunch of unnecessary overtime all because I didn’t start hyper focusing until 2:00 pm. 

ANYWAY, I’m on a generic brand of adderall, 10mg extended release. I’ve been taking it for four days and the side effects have been taking their toll on me. I take it early in the morning (8-9am) but have been getting headaches, my insomnia is acting up, occasionally experiencing diarrhea (eek). It doesn’t make me feel “up” at all and my focus is a little better but not much Should I keep trucking through and request a higher dose at the end of the 30 days to actually help with motivation and focus? Or do those experienced out there enjoy a different medication with less side effects that they could share their experience with me. Maybe if I had the standard one, I could take it in the morning and have it wear off in time for me to sleep through the night but I’m not sure! Any help would be great.

My boss actually told me that I should consider being evaluated. They're fairly sure I'm somewhere on the spectrum because we're very similar and they have been diagnosed.

Do you feel like you know your strengths?

I do think I can objectively identify some, but I also feel like it took so long to get diagnosed that I internalized a lot of my ADHD struggles as moral/internal failures or weaknesses. I *believe* in my weaknesses, but I can only objectively see my strengths.

  
Update: well I did it. I did not find it helpful in thinking about my strengths. Like some of you said in the comments, I recognize a lot of these behaviors in myself and don't see them as strengths or positives.  The bottom part asks you to identify which of these overlap with ""creative"" resources. Escaping into books made me an avid reader and a skillful writer. That's all I got.

Recently got diagnosed with depression partly due to school. Used to do really well in school, until I started uni (something something gifted child to burnout pipeline). I'm now in my second year and the thought of doing schoolwork/going to school/ exams literally makes me sick. 

I can't really tell if I hate the subject I'm studying (economics), or if it's a problem I have with going to school in general. Do I hate what I do, or do I just hate where I'm at right now? Would pursuing something I enjoy as a hobby (like cooking) be better? Are any of you in ""normal"" office jobs? If so, how are you coping?

I also have this desire to move to another country, away from everything and everyone I know, and start over. I want to figure out who I am and create my own identity, but I feel like I can't really do that if I'm surrounded by people who already know and define me. Or would moving just fuck me up even more lol.

2025-11-06 02:49:27;Looking for help dealing with rejection sensitivity and understanding my brain;"I’m 31f and not formally diagnosed, but my partner has been diagnosed (combined type) since childhood and my mom was also diagnosed. I always thought of myself as very different from them—high achieving, efficient, organized. But a lot of reflection from my partner has made me realize that I just muscle through and mask very well, while struggling a LOT with executive functioning especially emotional regulation. 

For example, I have always found it completely impossible to stick to routines for exercise, meal planning, or mornings. I am very self reflective and a strong communicator but I get stuck in emotions, especially around rejection. And the worst part is that my rejection sensitivity is triggered by my partners ADHD behaviors (that mirror my moms when I was growing up). Not being able to hold his attention when there is a lull in the conversation without him going to his phone feels like this huge, horrible signal that he doesn’t care about me. And there are many other little things like this where I feel rejected multiple times per day. I just try to shove it down but eventually it comes out in anger or sadness. Meanwhile, he feels like I can’t accommodate him or let him be himself. Because I truly can’t accept that his inattentiveness doesn’t mean he doesn’t care. And while I have very different things that give me motivation and dopamine (like deep convos), I can still be inattentive, and I realize I’m holding a double standard. 

This has also been impacting me in friendships and work lately. My fight or flight is triggered by small (or big) things and I can’t let it go. I have done plenty of therapy and I do have some mindfulness tools that have been helping. I’m looking for an ADHD specialized therapist now. 

I guess I’m looking for understanding and advice for how to get through this. I want to the people around me be themselves without feeling deeply hurt all the time. ";r/adhdwomen;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1opbhim/looking_for_help_dealing_with_rejection/
2025-11-06 02:47:32;Postpartum anxiety is unreal;"It's been a wild ride so far. I am 15 weeks postpartum, and I've been diagnosed with PPD and dealing with PPA.  
  
My anxiety was already not great, but I had coping skills that helped me push through it most of the time. My partner is always there for me as well, and helps ground me when I can't ground myself. But since giving birth, between the lack of sleep, family stress, and being on alert almost 24/7 because of the baby and my maternal instincts going into overdrive, my anxiety has been unreal.  
  
For instance, I had a stressful day between some drama happening with my landlady and a tenant that's renting a shop behind our house (long story), and my parents getting drunk and trying to give advice and come up with grand schemes as they are so infamous for. They are emotionally immature, and since the baby has been born they've been more pushy to come and visit. Meanwhile, I've been living 2 hours away from them because I couldn't live in my hometown anymore, and they rarely visited up until this point.  
I was feeling overwhelmed by all of that, and then this morning feeling anxious about not seeing my baby's chest rising with her breaths, but barely moves as it is. Then panicking that she slept for almost 13 hours, thinking something must be wrong.  
  
The most frustrating part of all of this is the logical part of my brain is telling me everything is fine, which it is. My baby is having a contact nap on me right now, and I'm just not answering my mom at the moment. But my mind still spirals into that anxiety loops. And my partner has always been fantastic, but he finds himself getting frustrated when the baby fusses and he doesn't know why, or when he's trying to do something and she needs attention. And having shorter patience with people, including myself. With the amount of times I tell him I'm anxious, he gets frustrated. He never used to, but he also doesn't know how exactly he can help, and he feels bad when he can't.  
  
Even though my baby sleeps through the night, I still wake up multiple times through the night. I'm not sure if it's because I pick up on a noise the baby is making, or if it's just my body alarm going off, but it makes for rough sleep. Sometimes I struggle to fall back to sleep.

2025-11-06 01:48:44;Adult children with ADHD and parenting guilt;"I was diagnosed with ADHD at 52, my now adult children were diagnosed at 16 and 23. 

I feel guilty that I was not aware of how ADHD impacts life. I was not aware that there were medications and strategies that could be helpful. I was unaware if untreated ADHD could be diblitating. I thought that it was common like being left handed and you just had to cope. 

The kids are the same age (twins) the one diagnosed at 16 received care a medication from her PCP. The treatment plan was never discussed with the parents. I have given our family PCP instructions that she was to treat the children as adults and that care didn't need to be approved by me. This was to give my kids a safe space to seek reproductive care. 

As she grew older she was open about being on ADHD medication and we assisted with support as she went to college. But, honestly I didn't ask too many questions and figured it was handled. She did not finish college, but is successful and happy. 

The other daughter just was diagnosed this week at 23. She showed no sign of ADHD and was extremely successful in school and graduated college. After graduation she suffered from major depression and we assisted with treatment. The psychologist that diagnosed her also mentioned that she is extremely intelligent and asked if she was ever in advance placement class. This is where the guilt comes in. In elementary school I opted out of advanced placement because the kids and parents participating were too intense and seemed to place too much pressure on their kids. It didn't feel like a good fit. Also, being twins I wanted them in separate classes but not to have different expectations. Well, the psychologist thinks I made a poor choice. 

Are there ways I can now support each of my unique children more. I feel like I failed.";r/ADHD;16;25;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1op9rkt/adult_children_with_adhd_and_parenting_guilt/
2025-11-06 01:46:40;I want to quit… should I listen to my restlessness?;"So I’ve just moved back to my old job (IT manager) after making a break for it in a different direction (sailboat captain).  My old boss was glad to have me back and I was welcomed with open arms from the whole team. 

I’m only two days back into my new role and it already feels like torture. The money is amazing (literally 5x/6x what I could earn as a sailboat captain) and offers early retirement, but it’s so easy and boring I feel totally understimulated. 

I only got a formally diagnosed with ADHD a month ago and am awaiting the start of my medication pathway. Should I wait to see how I get on with that before making any decisions? Has anyone else experienced similar and the medication helped? Has anyone got any advice on how to manage the restlessness? 

Worth noting that I didn’t feel at all like this when being a captain. But it was overstimulating in a lot of ways too which is why I came back. 

I really would be silly to walk away from a job that will see me retiring in circa 8/10 years (I’m 31 at the moment). Everyone tells me how lucky I am with what I’ve got. But my restlessness is telling me to bail out again.

Feels like my ADHD is being a big spoon stirring the soup that is my brain!

2025-11-06 01:39:46;How to manage mathematics as an adult who was recently diagnosed?;"Hi!

I have always had difficulty with math since I was about 10 and never was diagnosed for adhd until a few months ago(I'm now 25). I was always doing good in other classes as long as not too much math was included. My self-esteem really dropped since I was 10 because of this. I was able to get to a master's in biology through years of crying and anxiety for classes involving math (failing 2 math classes and 1 physics class in cegep\*pre university\*), which I'm proud of (the getting to a master's level part), but i feel like I am missing so much information that I was not able to retain even though I put so much time on my math classes, which I barely passed. I felt more relieved than ecstatic when I graduated, which I really hate since I love learning. I am doing a statistics class which I am struggling to understand (as usual) even if I am medicated. I really want to understand everything and take my time to learn since I love learning, but I have 4 classes, work and am doing preparation for my thesis, which I will focus on next session. During classes I am able to focus more because of meds and by reading the material beforehand but when I don't understand 1 thing I start panicking and stop listening to the teacher who gives us really important informations that do help me understand later on.

I don't really feel like asking my teacher for help as if he starts talking about some concepts I should have known from earlier classes I will just not understant his response. I do discuss with some classmates but I feel like I used classmates through my school years as crutches to pass classes and really want to avoid that. 

Anyway, I feel bad for feeling eager to finish school only because I find math hard, I do find joy with my classes but all of it is sucked by the anxiety brought by my math problems. It's like I wasted these years because of my unmedicated adhd. Also, I am not sure how my school's ressources could help.

So yeah I feel like I need some help...";r/ADHD;1;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1op9i93/how_to_manage_mathematics_as_an_adult_who_was/
2025-11-06 01:11:47;Help: Executive Dysfunction is ruining my life.;"I was diagnosed last year at 31, after many, MANY, years of thinking I had ADHD, and have since started adderall which has overall been a major help.

HOWEVER, I've noticed as I've gotten older that executive dysfunction has become a massive barrier in pretty much everything I do. It's always been a thing and I've always identified as a ""procrastinator,"" but the older I get the worse it's gotten. 

Right now, it's ruining my life in 2 main buckets:

* **Exercise:** I work from home and live a very sedimentary life overall. While I was hyperactive as a kid, I was never one for ""traditional"" or structured exercise. As I'm in my 30s and have a few different health things come up, I have become incredibly out of shape. I have a dream of being a runner; I did couch to 5K in my 20s and really enjoyed it. But then had knee surgery, life happened, the usual. But starting now feels exhausting and overwhelming. I kept telling myself all summer that I'd start when the weather got better, but now that it's here I just can't start. It's like my brain has thrown up a massive mental block and keeps making excuses. I keep telling myself I'll start when X happens or I do Y, but those things come and go and still I'm not starting.
* **Getting out of bed:** This sort of goes hand-in-hand with (lack of) exercise. Again, due to working from home and being overall sedentary, I'm exhausted all. the. time. This causes me to have a MASSIVELY hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I'll just lay there, usually on my phone, for anywhere from 20-30 minutes to over an hour on the weekends. It gets to a point where I feel like I'm wasting my whole day, I might as well give up. I hate it, and I don't find it restful or helpful in any way, but I just can't get it together. I yearn for a day when I wake up, feel rested, and jump out of bed, ready to greet the day. Maybe those days ended when I entered my 30s, but I have a hard time believing that's true. There has to be another way.

  
It feels like a tall ask, but truly if anyone has any tips to get my executive dysfunction in check in either category I'd so appreciate it. I want to have more energy, feel better about myself, and set a good example for the family I hope to have in the future. But this executive dysfunction makes me feel so stuck.";r/adhdwomen;14;15;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1op8pp1/help_executive_dysfunction_is_ruining_my_life/

2025-11-06 00:21:59;When did you know you were on the right medication (dosage)? I feel like taking mine are useless;"TLDR: I feel like my meds are doing exactly the opposite of what I need. My psychiatrist has been telling me for months to just up the dosage until I’m satisfied. So I’m in need of positive medication stories - how and when did you notice you were taking the right meds? Did you ever feel like giving up on the medication you were taking but pushed through and it ended up being the right one?

- 

I now feel like deleting this next paragraph after typing the TLDR but I just wasted 15 mins on it so if anyone wants to read it, thanks :)

I’ve (F28) been on methylphenidate on and off for a year now (I took it in middle school as well for about a year, which was 14 years ago. Then I quit meds and went back to it last year). 
I’ve tried different kinds, different dosages and I even tried antidepressants because methylphenidate gives me really bad anxiety.

Anyway, I’m currently taking 3x30mg a day, but the dosage might vary depending on what my day looks like. I’d say I mostly take 2x30 a day or 2x30 + 1x20.

I still get really bad anxiety from it, especially after my first dosage of the day. Its always about an hour after taking it and lasts for about an hour. It really, really sucks especially when I’m not at home but I’ve kind of learned to accept it and I just keep reminding myself that everything is fine and it’s just the medication and it’ll be temporary. And this week was the first time where it also made me feel like I was on coke, right before the anxiety kicks in lol. 

But I dont feel like the medication really does what it’s supposed to be doing… like I can’t stay focused, I’m still constantly ruminating which causes me to be way more on my phone than I used to be bc lets be honest, it’s an easy distraction.

I’m still in counseling with my psychiatrist (the one who re-diagnosed me last year) and whenever I tell him I don’t think it’s working he just tells me to keep on upping the dosage until I’m satisfied - he calculated the maximum amount of mg I can take a day to be 150mg, which sounds insanely high imo but he’s the specialist so whatever.

But its starting to feel useless. Especially now that it’s making me feel like I’m on coke, I just feel like I’m drugging myself for no reason at all.

I just want to be able to read my books without rereading every single sentence and without my thoughts drifting off, without getting triggered by a random word.
I want to stop hyperfixating on things and have ruminating thoughts about it non stop. 
I want to be able to get off the couch and just fucking do whatever the hell I’m supposed to be doing.

The past few weeks I’ve also started noticing I’m way less excited about things I used to enjoy. Like I just cant find joy in things and I dont care and I just want to lay down and be on my phone so I dont have to think of anything else.

I feel like this is just not the right medication for me but like I said: whenever I tell my psychiatrist I feel that way he just tells me to keep upping the dosage.

2025-11-06 00:00:52;My medication seemingly stopped working except for when it comes to sleeping...;"I was diagnosed with ADHD a little over 3 months ago. My doctor prescribed 20mg of D-Amphetamine and in the first month I was in bliss. My mind suddenly became uncluttered and I was actually focused, getting work done on time, and felt much more proactive in general. I almost cried because of how different I felt. It was like I was a functioning human for the first time in my life.

After the first month and a new refill it seemed like the effects were wearing off 2 weeks in. I started noticing myself procrastinate, didn't have the drive to do anything really, and my head felt loud, if that makes sense. I assumed I got used to the dosage so I talked to my doctor about possibly upping the dosage and he agreed. I was moved up to 30mg and nothing changed. That drive and focus that I had the first month is nowhere to be found. I'm letting things slip through the cracks at work, missed deadlines and forgetting to respond to messages/emails. 

I would assume the medicine isn't working at all except for the fact that I'm wide awake when it's time for bed. I've been getting about 4-6 hours of sleep for the last two weeks now unless I take melatonin before bed. I've tried not eating 2 hours before bed, no screen time an hour before bed, taking a warm shower but for whatever reason I'm wide awake until like 2/3 in the morning.

To make matters worse, I'm leaving for a week long business trip and my doctor is out until next week (when I'll be gone already) and the doctors office doesn't have any appointments available for me to speak with a different physician. 

I was reading some older threads here where people have mentioned similar issues as far as the effectiveness of their prescription wearing off and saw that a lot of commenters pointed out that it's a trial and error process and I might have to switch brands until I find something right for me.

I guess I'm just ranting but I was really optimistic about all this medication when I first started taking it. I'm feeling pretty frustrated now because I thought I finally found a solution to my problems.";r/ADHD;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1op6qwk/my_medication_seemingly_stopped_working_except/

I’d suspected it for years so wasn’t too much of a shock however, I’m still coming to terms with my diagnosis and growing to learn more and more about myself and ADHD. My biggest issue at the moment, which at this point I would genuinely say is ruining my life, is my sleeping patterns. I find it extremely hard to switch off at night and fall asleep, and extremely hard to wake up in the mornings. It’s been a running joke from family and friends my whole life that I “sleep like I’m dead” and could “sleep through a tornado”, but it’s really true! Once I’m asleep, NOTHING wakes me up and it’s honestly quite scary. Every night I set 25+ alarms and I end up sleeping through every single one of them because I literally don’t hear them. I wake up dazed, confused, sluggish, and tired every morning despite having 10+ hours. I need a way to wake up in the mornings because I have uni classes and appointments that I’m missing because I physically can’t wake up in the mornings.

2025-11-05 23:13:03;Memorizing lines while on meds;"Hey all, 
I don’t know if there are any other here, but I’m an actor and I got diagnosed with pretty severe adhd about a year ago. While I have access to meds (Ritalin in my case), I rarely take em cause I try not to be reliant on it. And also because I found that in a particular case, they’re not really helpful. 

Here it is : due to the nature of my job (auditioning very frequently), I often have to learn lines. And while it’s the most boring part of the job for most, it’s the most difficult one for me. I know that. Literally today, my only task is to learn a scene. It’s 4pm and I didn’t start yet. That’s when you come in and tell me “but just take your meds, they’ll help you focus” and that’s what I thought until I tried it ! 

A few months ago I was preparing a very intense workshop in Paris for which I had to learn a lot of different scenes. I started learning them a week or two in advance, so I wouldn’t do everything last minute as always. So for about a week I took Ritalin every day and the funniest thing happened : I had no problem getting to work, but actually learning the lines was so much harder. The exact opposite of when I’m off meds, which is : hard to get to it, but once I do I’m pretty efficient. Anybody in my case ? Any other actors with adhd here ? Tips on how to work with it ?

2025-11-05 22:49:07;How do you cope with “ADHD impostor syndrome”?;"I was diagnosed with ADHD about a couple years ago, and in many ways it felt like suddenly everything made sense. All these “personal flaws” I carried around forever suddenly had context: struggling to stay focused when people talk to me, jumping in because my brain thinks it already knows where the conversation is going, feeling mentally overloaded with more than two or three tasks in a day, getting paralyzed by “simple” chores, always feeling like I’m dropping the ball.

For years I thought I was just lazy, rude, forgetful, or “bad at being an adult.” My self-esteem was low as fuck. The diagnosis was honestly a relief. It explained patterns I’d been beating myself up over my whole life.

But then I started telling friends and family… and a lot of the responses were things like:

“Everyone has trouble focusing.”
“I do that too and I don’t have ADHD.”
“That’s just being stressed.”

It really messed with my head. I’ve since learned that ADHD doesn’t usually mean symptoms nobody else experiences, it means experiencing them with an intensity, frequency, and impact that actually interferes with functioning. Still, those comments planted doubt.

Now that I’ve started medication, the impostor syndrome is hitting hard. I keep having intrusive thoughts like “What if I don’t really have ADHD and I’m getting shit in my body for nothing?”. This kind of thoughts (mixed with a very bad start on meds) make me feel a heavy anxiety, I feel irresponsible somehow.

Even though the diagnosis was from a professional, even though it fits my lifelong behavior patterns… there's this anxiety that maybe I’m “faking it” without meaning to. And it’s exhausting.

So I guess I'm wondering:

Does anyone else struggle with this “ADHD impostor syndrome” feeling?
How did you deal with the doubt? Did it get better? How do you cope with it?

Not trying to self-invalidate, I just want to know I’m not the only one who spirals like this.

2025-11-05 19:27:28;I feel like my therapist isn't right for me;"Hi, I have already made a publication earlier about my experience with the same psychologist, but I think I'm really reaching the conclusion that we just don't match, despite trying to keep an open mind. 

Essentially, I started therapy about a year ago, and I've since gotten diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist, after just going out of my way to get diagnosed because the symptoms were just too much to deal with after starting my job. Since then, I have been doing quite better, I'm still in the titration phase and don't feel like I've reached the appropriate dose yet, but it has been fantastic help already, and I feel my life turning around.

I see my therapist to help treat my anxiety, negative thinking patterns and move past my trauma. The issue with my psychologist, since the beginning, has been that they make me feel invalidated about my ADHD. I have a hard time asserting myself so I don't immediately call them out when they say stuff that makes me feel invalidated (although the clearer mind is helping me with this), but the mood immediately shifts and I become defensive. 

In the latest session (a common theme) she centered the session around the fact that I have low self-esteem and should think about my achievements and not only where I am lacking, and that I am too focused all the time on being productive and not on ""living life to the fullest"". I agree somewhat, but the session started with me just talking about how the medication improved my quality of life dramatically, by helping me do boring stuff immediately that I was putting off to the last minute, and that I have lots more energy after work, for my hobbies, for my friends and family, how my thoughts are more organized and that I'm less reactive emotionally. I am focusing on these things and productivity because I was lacking in that specific area before and this is a big change for me that I am going through right now! Also when I'm talking to her I'm telling her about my problems mostly, for obvious reasons...

After focusing the conversation on why I feel the need to be productive and I explain that I was lacking there, for instance, I didn't pursue arts because it was hard to keep a routine of training for that and I didn't have much support for it, and I compared myself to a friend who pursued it because she persevered all by herself despite not having any support, she gives me this concerned/pitied face and says: ""you have done so much, you have a job, you have a degree, masters, not many have done that! You should focus on that more!"" and then she tells me I have cognitive distortions. I understand she is coming from a good place, but this does not help me, it just feels like she is telling me that my issues are not that ""real"" when she says that, and it also feels condescending... She also feels out of touch because she is always trying to tell me I can turn my life around and pursue things I like more, like arts, and then I wouldn't feel so bored and tired! when she is saying this it feels like it's so easy for her in her head, it feels like she just doesn't understand what ADHD is like, and the fact that it's not easy to just throw everything out the window like that, with all of the other ""adulting"" I have to do besides, these things require work and consistency which is where I struggle!

We are also not doing any specific therapy right now, it has just been talk therapy, which involves ""challenging"" me in this way all the time. She tried starting EMDR since I had some traumatic experiences, but we stopped because she ""needed to know me better and my traumas"" or smth like that, but she hasn't focused on that at all, just this subject of my low self-esteem, despite me giving her so many materials on the source of my traumas, so I am going to ask her again about that and see where it goes. She told me that I have somehow gotten the idea that she is trying to tell me my issues are not real and that it is not her intention, but I don't understand how she can't see that I would reach that conclusion, when she keeps insisting on this subject so much.

It also doesn't help that she has told me from the beginning, even after doing the dsm questionnaires on me, about adhd and other conditions, that it doesn't seem likely that I have it, or that it is significant enough, that it feels like there is something else there, even though she has no concrete idea of what it is 😅, and that I've since gone to this psychiatrist which has lots of knowledge on ADHD and immediately recognized it based on what I told her about my life and symptoms, so it just ends up feeling like the psychologist is forcing her ""view"" of me on me, based on her knowledge, and it feels like she doesn't have an open mind. Maybe it is me who doesn't have an open mind to ""understand"" what she really means, but it doesn't feel that way.

**TL;DR:** **therapist is invalidating my ADHD by insisting I just switch to a career (by snapping my fingers or smth) I like more so I don't feel so bored  and telling me I'm aLreAdY sUCcessFul sO whY aM I so FoCusED on ThIs 🙄**

2025-11-05 17:00:31;Dextroamphetamine meds and smoking weed;"Hi! I'm 25F diagnosed with ADHD. I've been on methylphenidate for +/- 2 years (on and off), and I've always been a big stoner. I used to smoke all day, but recently I started experiencing heart palpitations and nervousness during the day, especially after smoking weed and taking my meds. I stopped with cannabis, but the palpitations and nervousness did not go away completely. My doctor prescribed dextroamphetamine instead of methylphenidate to see if the issues would reduce.

What are your thoughts on combining dextroamphetamine and weed? Could the complications be worse or less compared to methylphenidate? I was told I shouldn't combine the two, but I love to smoke a j before working out and it really helps to get my appetite going (which is pretty much absent due to the meds). It also helps me fall asleep much more easily. 

I'm okay with quitting weed, but I would love to hear other people's experiences with this combination. Thanks! ";r/adhdwomen;0;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ooxyzd/dextroamphetamine_meds_and_smoking_weed/

And if its both, how the heck do you manage it??? 
For context, I'm medicated, but find managing symptoms and consequences exhausting, and I feel like I'm failing hard because nothing is working. Before being diagnosed, I was masking my symptoms with intense anxiety - then I had a period of acceptance, which led to my driving force diminishing, and the consequences of that has meant my anxiety has slowly returned as a coping mechanism (specifically for uni). I am on antidepressants too.

2025-11-05 13:20:07;Overwhelmed by Daily Maintenance as a Single Woman with ADHD;"So long story short, I’m 29, and was diagnosed at 27 after what was thought to be severe anxiety/depression ended up being ADHD (one vyvanse and literally no panic attacks since). From 22-26, after graduating college, I moved every year, sometimes even multiple times a year. This resulted in massive decluttering/“clean starts” yearly because when I’d get tired of packing, everything else would just get thrown in the dumpster (98% of that stuff being impulse buys or things sitting untouched that year in my closet).

Fast forward to today, I’m 29, and starting my THIRD year in the same apartment and I’m beginning to get really grossed out and disgusted with myself because of all of the things that needed maintenance cleaning that has been subsequently ignored because with how often I moved, I didn’t think about cleaning them (inside of oven, inside of washer and dishwasher, and all the random little crevices everywhere). And then, as I’m looking up how often people clean some of these things I’m realizing it’s way more than yearly (though to be fair, most videos I see are people with families and I’m single with a cat). 

And I struggle to keep on top of regular cleaning and like laundry or like preparing a real meal. How do people remember to clean everything that needs to be cleaned when it’s supposed to be cleaned?!?! On top of remembering to do fitness things and hobby things and self-care things and car maintenance things?!?! Like there are SO many things to keep track of! I feel like I need a massive yearly calendar so I can write down “March 22 and November 11 you have to clean your appliances. On September 7th you have to change the grease in your kitchenaid mixer”. 

The cleaning thing has set me in a spiral. I know my apartment is disgusting even though I just cleaned for my mom to come a few weeks ago. I can see all the random corners of buildup. It’s more than a deep clean service would do. And so much decluttering needs to occur. I was honestly just proud of myself earlier this week for remembering to renew my nursing license and car tag over a month before the deadline. If anyone has tips on how they keep track of everything they need to do without looking massively type A with the biggest jumbo planner ever, let me know.

2025-11-05 12:57:39;How do you deal with the fundamental issue of inattentive ADHD - impaired working memory?;"One of the fundamental issues of inattentive ADHD is impaired working memory. The issue is that an ADHD brain can't hold the information long enough in the working memory for it to be efficiently encoded and stored in long term memory. The consequence is that the information can't be retrieved for later use because it simply doesn't exist or exists in fragments which are not usable.

It can manifest in multiple ways. How it impacts me is that I have to start from scratch every time I deal with something novel.

Example - I am a software engineer. Often times I have to do things which I don't do on a daily basis and are not part of my core skill set. Every time I am in such a situation, I have to literally look at it like I have never done this before. It becomes time consuming and doesn't reflect good on me.

Another problem I face is that I ask same questions over and over again. Even about things which I have discussed in detail with someone. I simply can't hold information. It has gotten worse with time.

As a solution, conversations or information from others can be summarised and jotted down but the problem amplifies by orders of magnitude when it comes to my conversations with myself. Not just me, everyone has epiphanies or insights or small learnings every now and then that we want to save for future. There is no way to keep track of such pieces of information.

I want to understand from community how you are solving or mitigating this problem. A solution could be in any form, be it a software, a personal thought management system, or something else.

I am sure it will help a lot of people.

2025-11-05 12:03:38;Who else here is scared of the dentist?;"Teeth cleaning appointment Monday (for me the most anxiety-inducing of all dentist appts thus far in my life because of the unquantifiable probability of whether I will get bad news or not), and so naturally it’s time for me to start thoroughly falling into my anxiety-induced dentistry hyperfixation, which tonight has (so far) consisted of reading dentist-related posts on this sub.

There are legit non-ADHD trauma reasons for my fear. And I know dental fear/anxiety/phobia are common in general. However, I’m wondering whether it might be more common among ADHD/ND folks?

As I’ve explored the reasons for my own fear and how I experience and cope with it (more healthily now than in the past…thank God for good therapists), I definitely think ADHD plays a big part in why some of my experiences were as traumatic for me as they were. I felt a great deal of shame about my fear for a long time because my experiences seemed pretty benign/common (for example, having a bunch of cavities filled, without any pain that I remember, as a little kid, when my parents didn’t have insurance and it cost them a bunch of money), so I refused to acknowledge that I could have been traumatized by them and just told myself I needed to “grow up.” The big turning point for me in suffering less because of my fear was acknowledging that I am/was actually traumatized, which helps me remind myself, when I go to the dentist now, to try to be present in my competent adult self instead of being the scared and helpless 6 year old whose trauma is still encoded in my nervous system.

Anyway, I think pretty much the whole reason that (and other) pretty standard experiences at the dentist were perhaps unusually traumatic for me was because of RSD, plain and simple. I am a recovering perfectionist (also cause of RSD), which meant that having even one dental problem was a reflection on myself and my success and value as a human being. RSD somehow decided that recommendations to floss more were outright personal rejections. Add to this hyper-empathy/sensitivity that many of us know so well the lack of insurance and the super frugal money-sensitive way I was raised, and I could feel my parents’ disappointment in having to pay out of pocket to fill my childhood cavities and somehow knew it was all my fault and that I was an awful person. F*ed up my whole life and my teeth already and I’m just a kid.

I also think sensory sensitivities are big for me too. I had never considered until after my diagnosis how differently we all might experience the same thing. But the smells, the sounds, the bright lights, the weird materials, especially weird stuff in your mouth. Also the weird social interactions where they talk to you and you can’t  really answer. And just like being so…perceived and vulnerable (which for me this has to do with another unrelated trauma too…not just ADHD). And for me, more than anything, the damn water and spit running down your throat choking you all the time that you’re afraid to swallow cause you think you’ll mess them up. 

Guess what? I asked them last time about that. They said “Oh no of course it doesn’t mess us up, always swallow when you need to!” Yeah, well swallowing laying down isn’t so great anyways but good to know 😂";r/adhdwomen;8;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oot046/who_else_here_is_scared_of_the_dentist/

I don’t screw up often. Actually, I pride myself on being pretty on top of things. But the few times I do mess up? They are brutal. Like, “my stomach is in my throat, replay this moment on a loop until I die, why did I say that” level bad.

Quick background: diagnosed ADHD in 2nd grade. On meds most of my life, recently stopped Vyvanse. I’m a nurse going on 20 years, 7 into the current specialty and now in a management/clinical liaison role. Meaning… my words matter. A LOT. Legal stuff, medical stuff, patient safety, representing my company, all that fun high-stakes brain-pressure.

And 99% of the time, I handle it. I over-prep, double-check myself, stay professional, all good.

But then there will be that one conversation. The one time my brain switches to “fast-forward mouth mode” before the rational thoughts load. Either I say too much, say the wrong thing, or make a decision too fast. And suddenly my whole nervous system is like:

“You blew it. Everything is ruined. Time to mentally pack your belongings and move into a cave.”

It’s like childhood me shows back up. The kid who was always getting in trouble for blurting things out. The one constantly apologizing, misunderstood, or saying something I immediately regret. Except now it’s not a teacher being disappointed. It’s real-world consequences and an adult career.

And the shame spiral? Unreal. My brain won’t stop replaying it. I’ll redo the convo in my head a thousand times. It’s exhausting.

I genuinely love my job and I know I’m good at it. But moments like today make me question whether I should even be in this role. It’s like the ADHD gremlin crawls out just long enough to remind me “Hey, remember? You can mess everything up at any time.”

I hate it. And I feel so alone in it.

Like… does anyone else relate to this? The occasional impulsive communication slip that sends you into an existential panic about your entire career and life choices?

2025-11-05 10:18:27;Finally getting on the stimulant;"Hello my fellow ADHD besties.


Tell me your histories with Vyvanse. 


I’ve (33F) been diagnosed with adhd since I was about 10. I tried Ritalin when I was 10 and again at about 14. At the time Ritalin jacked my anxiety up to 7282828. I also have never been able to sleep, and the stimulant made me stay up for days. The doctor’s solution was to put me, a 14 year old, on ambien. Needless to say the whole ordeal left me scarred. 


I’ve just been largely raw dogging life since as far as adhd goes. I did however do so much work on my mental health in the nearly 2 decades since. Since going corporate, becoming a mom, getting promoted- my adhd has taken over my life. It’s absolutely EXHAUSTING being hyper vigilant all the time and STILL putting your wallet in the back seat pocket of an uber and leaving. 


My recent therapist gave me the biggest aha. Most of my current anxiety can be attributed to my adhd. I told her every time I open my purse a wave of anxiety just crushes me until I frantically locate my phone, keys, wallet to make sure they are there. The way I quadruple check every work email, spreadsheet- makes me go so much slower at work. My auditory processing is… none? I cannot retain spoken instructions and I absolutely CANNOT hear without subtitles. And as I try to sleep- the wheels of my brain won’t stop spinning trying to find anything I could have forgotten or did wrong until the wave of anxiety buries me and all I can do is lay there paralyzed. 


So a couple years ago I started non stimulants. Guanfacine? Gnarly dreams and too sleepy. Clonidine? Caused rebound blood pressures so bad I was ordered off of it. Straterra? Puke puke puke. I laid on the floor wretching. Wellbutrin? Great for appetite control. Did nothing to my ADHD. 


I’ve been hesitant on the stimulants for fear I go off the rails- but I don’t see a single other option. I’m excited, optimistic, apprehensive. 


I take it for the first time tomorrow so… whew. ";r/ADHD;2;5;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ooqtcc/finally_getting_on_the_stimulant/

i'm a bit hesitant to seek professional help because the thought of approaching a doctor and being wrong just makes me anxious. i don't really want to seem stupid or anything like that... and i'm a bit worried i'm just making up the symptoms, so when i actually try to get an evaluation, they're going to be like wow you are actually so dumb for even thinking you had this lmaoooo.

I know, real smart starting two new meds at once. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else had the same happen to them? Did it get better? 

I've heard that GLP1s can make ADHD meds less effective. Is that true? Can it get better, or should I ask about a different diabetes medication? I have no idea what to think, other than ""nap necessary.""

Any advice or explanations are greatly appreciated!

Worried I didn't quite say enough during the interview portion with the neuropsych, I forgot just about everything I wanted to talk about apart from executive dysfunction.

2025-11-05 07:31:28;Strange question on intake form;"I (24F) have struggled with what I suspect is ADHD for as long as I can remember. I grew up in a country without access to any kind of mental health care and so for the first time, as an adult living abroad, I am exploring my options for getting help. I was referred by my university’s counseling department to an outside practice and the first thing on the list was to fill out a very lengthy intake form. I’m a bit shocked at some of the questions on the form, I guess I just had no idea what to expect.
Is my dad and sister being left-handed really something that could have an impact on my diagnosis?
That being said, do any of you ladies have tips for getting your foot through the door and managing to fill out all the forms, etc. ? Getting a professional opinion scares me and I already feel so drained, without even completing the first step.";r/adhdwomen;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oon1rx/strange_question_on_intake_form/

It also got delayed a bit because they to get a second observer form because the first one seemed inconclusive and they said I could be “sub clinical.”

While I would consider myself to be high functioning (haven’t lost jobs, relationship, friends, etc) I still feel like I could benefit so much from the right medication and I’m desperate for something that would help. I’m going to be really disappointed if I don’t get the diagnosis.

ADHD symptoms got way worse in the past 2 or 3 years. Worse memory, horrible focus, disattachment, and strangely submissive !!!

It’s always tasks that are easier than the ones I actually can get myself to do.

2025-11-05 05:28:07;Is it worth switching from Wellbutrin to Strattera?;"I’m newly diagnosed with both adhd and autism, and I’m re-evaluating the meds I’ve been on for years for General Anxiety Disorder. I was on 300mg Effexor and 300mg Wellbutrin until recently. I dropped to 225mg Effexor last month and just decreased my Wellbutrin to 150mg starting last Friday. I was supposed to start taking 40mg Strattera at the same time, but I’m delaying it since there are some possible interactions with another med I’m taking (Wellbutrin has the same exact interaction listed, which I just realized, so maybe I shouldn’t worry too much about it). Also, my diastolic BP has been high (high 80s to low 90s), and I don’t know what I should be doing about that. 

Anyway, it’s been a few days with the lower dose and I can’t seem to focus on my work and I’m having melt downs. My brain just doesn’t seem to work the way I’m used to. Some of that could be that my social battery died from having guests over the weekend, but I’m wondering how much of this is from the Wellbutrin?  

I also see Wellbutrin is often used off label for ADHD. So my question is: does anyone have experience switching from one medication to the other?  Is it worth trying the Strattera or should I go back to Wellbutrin?  I mean it wasn’t perfect, but I hate feeling so useless at my job!  My diagnosis shows I’m mostly inattentive, but I have some borderline hyperactive tendencies (eg impulsive shopping, racing thoughts), if that helps.

2025-11-05 05:27:25;For those who chose testing/diagnosis—Any regrets?;"Recently had my first meeting with a provider I was referred to for testing. I am already starting to regret the decision, mainly because he didn’t seem particularly interested in the ADHD portion. I’m worried he’ll try to nail me with some stereotypically “female” disorder because he mentioned testing for “everything” including “personality disorders”. We spoke for just under an hour and had never met before. Now I’m afraid I didn’t advocate for myself enough or go into my symptoms enough. I just don’t want someone to dismiss me again or, like, throw a bullshit diagnosis at me and say “take an SSRI and go away.” He also sounds like he deals with a lot of heavy trauma which always makes me fear I won’t be taken seriously because frankly I consider my own traumas to be pretty run of the mill.

I was diagnosed in childhood with ADD, and was on Ritalin for years until age 13. I remember the medication helping me. Maybe my childhood diagnosis coupled with the assessment will mean he will actually help me.

I was on this same dose for yearssss prior to being pregnant with no issues and I recently had to stop taking it about a month ago because it made my anxiety terrible and I would end many days in a crash out burn out. 

My doctor put me on Zoloft after I stopped the Adderall, which helps with the anxiety but I feel depressed a lot of the days. Most days I can’t get anything done and the smallest tasks feel like climbing a mountain to me.

Long story short, I am tired of meds and them not managing my moods well. It’s hard postpartum and I’m looking for advice or recommendations from anyone who’s had similar experiences. I would love something holistic, naturopathic etc. but if you got a med that works I’ll give that a shot too.

That's when getting/starting the accommodations process came to mind. Problem is my college requires a whole report similar to ones you get for ASD or educational testing. 

I got diagnosed at 25 about 15 minutes after walking into my appointment lol. My NP said she could see it and going through the DSM confirmed her suspicions. Plus I tried meds with a previous doctor and they worked for me.

But I don't have anything to provide my school. They want background history and more.

Has anyone else run into this issue? I know I can just get testing ($1200 for the least costly place in my area) but I'd like to avoid the most expensive option unless necessary since I'm cash flowing through college now. 🥲

2025-11-05 04:05:48;I genuinely can’t stop feeling overstimulated why is everything so incredibly intense;"I feel like I‘m always giving 120% and I‘m constantly fighting to give my attention to the right thing. At work it’s focusing on my task instead of focusing on the random noise the machine makes. At home it’s focusing on my hobbies instead of my partner calling with friends and even tho I join him often, the calls and gaming sessions get overwhelming but I also get horrible FOMO so it’s hard for me to take breaks. I can’t do the things I wanna do because my brain decides it doesn’t get the dopamine the way it wants but IF YOU LET ME DO THE THING YOU WOULD GET DOPAMINE!!! I need a lot of silence but not too much silence or I get restless thoughts. I’m always chasing ideas and plans but I‘m chronically exhausted so I can’t finish them. 
When I first got diagnosed with adhd I was glad I had an explanation for my issues, but finding out that every quirk and trait i have is literally just adhd is a frustrating experience. The fact that there’s no cure to RSD is killing me. The fact that I constantly forget to reply to people makes me feel so guilty and embarrassed that I start replying even less because I don’t wanna be confronted with someone I hurt. I avoid all my problems until its too late and then do incredible maneuvers to fix them and tell myself next time I will work on them early on but next time is always worse. The fact that all my mental health professionals said it’s incredible I didn’t get diagnosed as a child because my issues were so obvious hurts. I feel let down by teachers, doctors and my parents, I feel like I didn’t get the support I needed and it hurts to know that things could be different. Most of the time I feel like I’m a normal human and I learned how to deal with most aspects of adhd but sometimes I talk to friends and family and realize I‘m fundamentally different in the way my brain works. Noone else I know notices the random noises things make all the time. Noone shuts down because they heard two sounds at once. Noone else cries because they got too many messages and feels overstimulated. I know there are other people like me out there but in my personal life I feel like I‘m alone. I have an incredibly supportive partner which is a big privilege but I still struggle so much. I rely so much on his comfort and acceptance and I won’t ever be able to return the favor because he just lives without breaking down when he hears too many noises and can decide when to do stuff instead of having to rely on your whims?? Sorry if I’m rambling but I need to hear from people who feel the same I need to be validated in my experience. 
How do you guys handle overstimulation? I feel like the only thing that works for me is a day of doing little to nothing but time is a limited resource. I wish the world was more accepting and accessible. I don’t even hate having adhd, I love my attention to detail and the ability to feel love and compassion in such an intense way and being an idea machine is amazing.

2025-11-05 04:04:24;Is it normal for your psych to make you get multiple EKG's for an Adderall script?;"I (36F) was diagnosed with ADHD at 19 years old, but have never really taken medication for it. 

The doctor who originally diagnosed me put me on Wellbutrin, because he deemed me depressed as well—which, I suspect that I also have ASD (and the ""depression"" he diagnosed me with was really just autistic burnout)—but, I only took it for about 2 weeks because it made me feel legitimately crazy. This kind of scared me away from taking meds, and I've been trying to manage on my own ever since.

But, within the past year, I've really been *struggling.* It feels like my symptoms have gotten worse with age. So, after going down a rabbit hole of how effective Adderall is in relieving ADHD symptoms, I've spent the past two months jumping through hoops trying to get a prescription—and it's really starting to aggravate me. 

I got re-diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist that appeared to be a genuinely nice person—not saying that he isn't, but I'm starting to regret being seen by him. He asked if I had any family history of a sudden cardiac event and, yes, my bad passed away from sudden cardiac arrest (I should've lied). 

So, the psych wanted me to get an EKG. Cool, I'd actually had one done the month prior because I had a panic attack, and drove myself to the ER, because I just had so much anxiety. The doctor at the ER ran an EKG (twice, just to cross t's/dot i's) and he said that the results came back perfectly normal both times. I told my psych I could have the results faxed over.

He alerted me that *he* found an anomaly in the findings that worried him and wanted to have me cleared by an actual cardiologist. 

Just had that second EKG done, by an actual cardiologist, who said everything came back normal. But, after the cardiologist found out about my dad's sudden cardiac arrest, they said they'd eventually want to get an ultrasound of my heart as well, ""just in case."" I had the results faxed over that showed my EKG came back normal.

He's now saying that because this EKG didn't show the anomaly (the anomaly that no one else is mentioning except for him, btw), he wants to wait for the ultrasound of my heart. And the clinic doesn't have any availability for this until December 31st.

I feel great and I feel like the meds help so much. I am organized at work and generally on task.

However, I am struggling a lot at home particularly in the evenings after work with cleaning and chores. I've spoken to my psychiatrist about possibly having another dose of Ritalin during the evening right when I get home.

I've tried every method possible that was recommended including caffeine, charts, etc and I'm struggling to stay on task to the point that my room and house and laundry is honestly a huge disaster and I'm just like awful with chores. My psychiatrist keeps ignoring my explanations and keeps telling me to try caffeine in the evening or to delay my dose during the work day because they don't want me to get addicted but I need the dose to work.

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this I genuinely am not looking to be an addict I'm just looking to be able to do the tasks I need to because it's interfering with my quality of life.

I have friends who are on much higher doses and I don't even want or need like a high dose. I feel like that's a generally reasonable ask but maybe I'm wrong I don't know.

2025-11-05 02:13:26;Advice about a job with no work;"Howdy,

Just got my official diagnosis papers today and am now navigating the world as a 33 year old with hyperactive and inattentive ADHD. I've got a doctor's appointment in a couple months to discuss medication.

I am fairly new at my job and the work is almost nonexistent. I go in office for 8 and a half hours and if I'm lucky I'll work an hour and day. Otherwise I am just scrolling on my phone, trying to look somewhat busy, but that is wearing heavily on my mental health. I have Libby and when the motivation strikes I sometimes find myself tearing through a book, but some days my brain is just moving too fast to read. The job is corporate so I can't do much on my computer. Podcasts would be nice but then I have nothing to do with my hands and nothing to look at so it's just this feeling of being lost to what can really make the day go by.

I am struggling harder than I ever have. I go home exhausted and just lose myself to this hopeless that I'm stuck at this job with nothing to do and no energy or hope to really look and try to apply to other jobs, especially in this job market.

2025-11-05 02:06:35;How to deal with extra pressure from family;"Ive been in a burnout/depressive phase the last year after getting diagnosed with ADHD while trying to finish my degree. More than me, my parents find my study the most important thing in my life (especially my father), so earlier this year when I broke down into depression my dad was very ‘demanding’ that i continue my degree even though i really needed a break then, which of course backfired on me since ive been in a burnout state since (even though i tried to force myself to work harder, i could not muster up the energy to finish my thesis until now). 
Anyways, everytime i have contact with my family (text, call, visit) he brings up uni and how far i progressed right away and nothing else in my life. Because of this i dread speaking to them or coming home from time to time even, since i know he will start about it and since i have not been progressing (as fast as i want) this gives me a dreadful/ashamed feeling to have to ‘disappoint’ everyone every time i talk to them/him, since he keeps going on and on about it and how this should be my number 1 priority. Ive been ignoring calls from home which makes me sad but as im already super overwhelmed lately, i cant take more shame and stress than i already have. Has anyone else dealt with pressure like this from loved ones when you’re already low/struggling, if so how did you deal with it?";r/ADHD;1;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ooegue/how_to_deal_with_extra_pressure_from_family/
2025-11-05 02:02:57;My suspicions were validated;"I've suspected that I have adhd since I was 12 years old and have been trying to get diagnosed since 2023 (age 24). whenever I mentioned it, I was told that it cannot be adhd as I and I am diagnosed with bpd and that I'm just trying to collect a diagnosis 🙄. This was usually said my male professionals, while female presenting ones later on changed their opinion since I'm apparently ""too organised at first glance"". My school reports were dismissed, while I was labelled as a lazy university student trying to get medication. I've also been seeing a therapist since 2024, who said that I might no have adhd and that we should focus on my bpd. I was ok with it, as I thought that I might be delusional with me potentially having ADHD the whole time. 

During today's session my therapist said that a specific struggle of mine is due to my ADHD. SHE VALIDATED ME YALL AND SHE THINKS THAT I HAVE IT. It's such a relief, that this woman who has been a great help, validated me and thinks that I am struggling!! I wasn't delusional, I was right. All the struggles at uni, at home, with dishes, overstimulation and me not being focussed enough - they were actually validated and with this I might be able to get medicated in the future.

Up until now, I was always told that I'm too organised to have ADHD, even if I was living in chaos. It's official and while I do feel sadness, frustration and anger, I also feel seen😭😭";r/adhdwomen;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ooed4v/my_suspicions_were_validated/

For a while now, I've been suspecting that I might have adhd. In my childhood I thought  I was just lazy weird, and oberly sensitive one of the tactics I used to get things done was stress, creating negative self dialogue, scaring myself into being desciplined, having emotionally enmeshed parents helped with it too, because a lot of things I did was to get their affection and approval. I started questioning myself when I moved out of my parents house, there was no structure anymore, I was free.Living in a capital tired me so much constant, noise, people, ..some symptoms that I noticed is trouble to cut out what is more important in noise and prioritising thigns to do, impulsivity especially when stressed or excited, not finishing things which leads to low self worth, constant fidgeting and feeling restless if I don't, doing a lot of things& searching for novelty and then suddenly feeling burnt out, not sticking to plans, fogetting things, hard to keep attention for long, multitasking,iterrupting others, being late due to hardly estimating how much time doing something would take me, being scared of eye contact.

Will be (hopefully) attending law school next fall at the ripe age of 32. I know it's not old, but just older than the average age.

I've been diagnosed for a few years, medicated, and have greater awareness of my strengths and weaknesses. But.....things are still a struggle.

So for those of you who have completed law school, especially if you were a bit older (though this matters less), what are your UNHINGED and unconventional tips.

Things you did that helped you that might not make sense to neurotypical. How did you get through your readings consistently? How did you help yourself get started? How about for sustained focus? Were you working really weird hours and that worked for you? It could be big or small, just would love to hear from you all.

2025-11-05 01:18:06;Ex thinks he's an ADHD expert and doesn't want our son medicated for his;"This is moreso of a rant than anything else, but I needed to get it off my chest because I'm beyond irritated. 

My son (9) finally got a formal ADHD diagnosis. I've known for years that he's had it and prior to the last two years, it wasn't really a huge issue because his grades were still good and he wasn't getting into much trouble at school. 

  
Last year is when he really started to struggle. Constantly in trouble for being distracting to his peers, out of his seat, off task, etc etc. Coming home with packets of unfinished work because he was too distracted to do it at school. We're running into the same issues this year. Both his teachers and I filled out his evaluation forms and he got his diagnosis. His pediatrician, who he's been seeing since he was a baby, prescribed him the lowest dose of Adderall. He just took his first dose today. I guess yesterday he told his father he was prescribed it before I could have the conversation with him. 

  
Some backstory - I left his father as soon as our son was born because he was abusive. To me, to the dogs, to his own mother. I could write an entire novel on that and it would sound like a Jerry Springer episode. But that aside, I've resorted to parallel parenting over the years because an attempt at coparenting, unless it went his way, resulted in our son being punished and spanked over at this house, cops called on me, etc etc. CPS has been involved multiple times over the years, but as there are only ""concerns of abuse"" on their end, nothing was ever done. 

  
Anyways - I call his father and explain that our son has been struggling in school socially and with staying on task. He acts like this is all new information, despite having the same ability to schedule parent/teacher conferences and being handed the sign up information for the parent portal. He claims he has ""a lot of experience"" with this and I should've told him so he could work on it. And that I need to give him time so he can ""figure something out"". What is there to figure out? Our son is struggling. He himself has expressed frustration that he can't focus. It's effecting his school, sports, and social life. He's been in therapy. His teachers all see it and can vouch for it. I've tried all the tricks with supplements and caffeine. He doesn't really eat junk food aside from ramen after football practice because I'm not making second dinner at 9pm. 

  
I'm just supremely irritated. This man is off in his own little world and outside of his scheduled visitations, has minimal involvement in our son's life. 40 years old, can't keep a job for more than a year, 10s of thousands in arrears with child support (that's just for our son, not including his other child and now he has a baby on the way). His idea of parenting is parking our son in front of the tv and letting him watch South Park, King of the Hill, and making fun of him for not liking boobs (yes, this is a real thing that happened. He is a CHILD.).



I have primary custody but we have joint legal. I'm just waiting for him to drag me back to court and make a fuss over this when all I'm doing is acting in the best interest of our son.  

  
If you read this far, thank you for reading my tangent. I also have ADHD but am unmedicated (not necessarily by choice, but because my insurance is a nightmare to deal with). ";r/adhdwomen;103;37;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ood4zo/ex_thinks_hes_an_adhd_expert_and_doesnt_want_our/

2025-11-05 00:45:00;(Advice Needed) RSD & Anxious Attachment;"Hello ADHD ladies! Please bear with this long post!

So, I'm in my early twenties, in college, and have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and adhd few months ago. 

I'm on medication for anxiety (sertraline) which has been working great, no adhd medication since it's extremely hard to get in my country. 

Usually, I can manage my focus problems more or less, I can get by enough to pass my classes and do my homework etc. 

Well 6 months ago I got into my first ever relationship, with a common friend from my college. It is also his first ever relationship and we are slowly navigating things as we are both similar ages (I'm 1.5 years older). 

Since we are both so new and clueless about this, we have miscommunications sometimes. For example during summer break we were so far from each other and it was difficult because we were both working and he has a busier schedule making it harder to text properly and I'd take it the wrong way. 

Now, we are back in uni, but we've had an ""argument"" about me pointing out how he was teasing me and he thought I was complaining about it so he got upset. In the moment, he wanted to take some time to think before talking to me bc he knew he wasn't being logical. But that period of ""silence"" completely triggers me because I have a bad history with the silent treatment. I spent a day crying my eyes out unable to do any work or anything meaningful, and another day doing the same because he hadn't talked to me on day 2 of the ""fight"" (turns out he was too sick to even get out of bed)

Few days back we had another miscommunication over which way we were taking, it was silly and we apologized to each other after and went on. However even so I kept thinking he's mad at me and he's planning on breaking up with me because I always bring too many problems (this is what I think, he never said this). Then, he's been texting me a bit dry after which I didn't appreciate so I asked about it and he said he's not upset at me so I was like okay it's not a me problem but I didn't understand why he was still being so dry?

Anyway, we talked about that too and I made sure to tell him that I have a very hard time reading tone over text. However, every single time I have to talk about how I feel I feel like I'm initiating conflict in the relationship and I feel like he's eventually gonna be sick of it. He's genuinely a sweet man and he always shows me that he cares with random acts of service, but I just can't help but have that voice in my head telling me one day I'll ruin everything and it's all going to be MY fault. 

Does this make sense? I looked into RSD especially among ppl in relationships and it was very similar to what I'm going through. 

Any solutions to this? To make me still live my life and be my own person without being worried 24/7 about being the doom of my relationship because lately I cannot even sleep properly and it's a lot, especially knowing he's probably not going through all this.

2025-11-05 00:09:01;Purchasing a new car- what are the best safety features to help with distracted driving;"I (36F) will be purchasing a new car soon. I am hoping for an SUV. I drove  a Jeep Liberty for 10 years and a Nissan Rogue for another 10 years. Here's the backstory and why I need advice.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 8 and have been on medication ever since. I've been on Vyvanse for the past 17 years (When it first came out in 2008). However, lately it feels like the generic is not working as well as the brand name. My executive functioning is non existent and now I take my Vyvanse about 90 minutes before I actually have to get up in hopes that it's ready to start working by then. I also drink an energy drink until it kicks in as well. I take 10 mg of Adderall after work to help with evening executive functioning and sometimes I can feel the medicine crash instead of slowly dip off.

Most recently I was backing out of my driveway, and backed into my neighbors truck and dented my bumper. I went to get it fixed and picked it up from the collision shop on a Wednesday. The next night, I hit a car in front of me when we were at a red light. The light had turned green and I took my foot off the break. I swear I did not accelerate. The next thing I know is that I hit the car in front of me. Despite how hard the crash felt, including the jolt forward, there was no damage (Even weirder). 

However, this totally freaked me out and now I'm to scared drive despite being a very confident driver. I was thinking about getting a new car and now I know that I need one with better features including apple Carplay (So that I'm not looking at the maps and zooming in on my phone while it hangs on a little mount (no where near as good as an infotainment would be), sensors and alerts behind me, in front of me, and to the side.

I know they say that manual transmissions are actually better for ADHD people, however, I am not in the market to learn to drive a stick shift.

2025-11-04 23:46:17;I'll get my ADHD evaluation tomorrow, how does it work?;"After years, i finally convinced my new Psychiatrist to refer me to a doctor who will evaluate me tomorrow for an ADHD diagnosis. I already went through an Autism assessment 3-4 years ago, but i don't know if the ADHD one is different. I know that i have to bring one of my parents with me, but he also said that ""if you can bring a parent to the appointment we will do everything in one day"", does it mean that the entire assessment lasts just one day? I ask because the Autism one took 4 different appointment between talking and various tests, so it sounds a bit strange to me. I should also point out that i'm doing this at my local CSM (Mental Health Center) which is not really famous for its professionality...so i'm a bit worried. Problem is that it was the only one avaliable and my i talked with psychiatrist in JUNE, and i received the call from this doctor only last week. There's free healthcare but waiting times are exruciatingly long and...the doctors are what they are. I didi my Autism appointments always with free healthcare but in a different clinic.

So, how does the ADHD assessment works? Does it really last just one day to do everything?

I already took a bunch of self-test to show my doctor because i want him to know that i'm not a total ignorant and i know what i feel and what i'm talking about, can this help?

The issue I’m having is with one of my major ADHD symptoms which is overstimulation. After a day where I’m physically at work around people I’m EXHAUSTED! So the next day I’m beat and don’t physically go into work. I have been struggling with guilt for staying home those 2x a week.

I feel lazy and ashamed. Like how dare I just take a slow day when so many people don’t get that option? Why can’t I be like my colleagues and do it every day?

I just feel so guilty even though I logically know that I’m not making this feeling up or the need for those days at home. I know our “gas tanks” work differently.

I also feel guilty that my parents and my friends have to show up every day. I would give them my days at home if I could. It just feels unfair even though they do not have ADHD or social fatigue.

2025-11-04 22:22:41;My life is a mess;"Hey everyone. I’m 19F and was just recently diagnosed with ADHD after struggling with symptoms my entire life. My parents didn’t pursue a diagnosis when I was younger because my seizure medication had ADHD-like side effects, so I’ve spent years trying to push through without understanding what was actually going on. Finally having a diagnosis feels like an important first step, but I’m still adjusting and honestly a little overwhelmed.

Academics have always been my biggest challenge. I’ve usually managed to do “fine,” but no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to reach the level I know I’m capable of. I’m currently a sophomore studying mechanical engineering, which is already a tough major, and ADHD definitely adds another layer of difficulty. My GPA is around a 2.9 right now. I need a specific GPA to get into my college’s engineering program, and I’m really struggling in Calculus II at the moment, mostly because it’s been hard to stay motivated and consistently practice. To make things tougher, I just found out the Calculus I class I took over the summer isn’t being counted, so I either have to retake it or take the CLEP exam.

Outside of classes, life has also felt like a lot lately. I live alone in a single dorm, and basic tasks like laundry, refilling my water filter, and taking care of myself have started to feel strangely difficult. I work about 15 hours a week and I’m involved in a club almost every day, so I’m constantly busy, but also very burnt out. Sometimes it feels like life is just piling up faster than I can handle it, and it’s hard not to feel like I’m losing my grip.

I just started Zoloft for generalized anxiety, and until I can meet with a provider about ADHD meds I’m staying on it, but honestly it feels like it might be making my ADHD symptoms worse. I don’t know if that’s real or if I’m imagining it, but everything feels louder and harder right now.

I would really appreciate any advice on improving academically, especially in math. I truly believe I can be good at it if I can just build consistency. I’d also love recommendations for ADHD resources geared toward college students or young adults, and advice on making everyday life feel less overwhelming and more manageable.

Thank you for reading. I’m trying my best, and I’m new to all of this, so please be kind. I really just want to learn how to live in a way that doesn’t feel so stressful and exhausting all the time.

TLDR: 19F, newly diagnosed with ADHD after years of struggling without knowing why. Mechanical engineering major, currently overwhelmed academically and emotionally. GPA ~2.9, struggling especially with Calc II, and found out my Calc I credit didn’t transfer. Living alone, working 15 hrs/week, involved in clubs, feeling burnt out and struggling with basic self-care. Just started Zoloft and feel like it might be making ADHD symptoms worse.

For years, doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 8 and have been on and off medications ever since, mostly Abilify throughout my teenage years up until recently. I didn’t graduate high school, almost entirely because I couldn’t get myself out of bed in the mornings. Since then, my life has felt like a spiral — starting new jobs only to inevitably quit. The external pressure from family and friends to “get my life together” grew stronger, which I knew I needed, but I always felt like a complete failure. After many attempts to figure out what was wrong, I came across the idea that I might have severe, undiagnosed ADHD. Since May when i started vyvanse I’ve been going to work every day. No more sleeping 12–16 hours, then waking up tired, sinking into depression, and shutting down. Vyvanse has fixed my chronic fatigue — something I didn’t even realize I had — and gives me a burst of energy and focus every morning to get through the day. I feel blessed to have found it and am trying not to dwell on how life “may have been” had I discovered it earlier. If you are struggling, stay strong and keep fighting. From my experience, a lot of mental health struggles can be managed or significantly improved with the right medication. I’d love to hear other people’s experiences with Vyvanse — the ups and downs — and I’m happy to answer anything I can help with.

2025-11-04 21:25:15;Is the insane sleep inertia normal?;I just got diagnosed 2 months ago and started meds. Started the first month on Ritalin IR 10mg, then switched to Concerta 18mg on the next month (currently taking). What i noticed is my sleep inertia being so strong and my sleep has never been the same compared to my undiagnosed days. Before meds, i can take a day even if i just sleep for 5 hours. After concerta, even with 8 hours of sleep, even 10, i feel so groggy and zapped with energy. Its so difficult to get up, like i didnt sleep at all. Is this normal?

Could I be expecting too much from my medication? I’m not feeling euphoric or energised (I’m just getting a buttload of indigestion). Am I expecting too much too soon? I’m diagnosed ADHD but could it be something else if meds aren’t working.

I had such high-quality interests, studied physics, but in reallity I never finished a book (maybe a few in 31 years of life). I have so many started projects and unfinished tasks. It finally got to me and I am in a rut - no hobbies no friends, I just walk around aimlessly or sit 24/7.

I went to see a psych and they said I have ""continuity"" problems in the first 2 minutes of talking to them. My lack of focus or abillity do actualy start/finnish something was obvious.

They are having me tested and put on meds - which I am kind of anxious about because I am 2 years deep into a freeze and it's my comfort zone - I do nothing but I also don't have to do anything. I'm a bit worried about being ""started"" that the emotional rush and thought avalanches are going to be too much to handle.

We only have Ritalin available, and as I gather it works differently from amphetamines/Aderall which at leas I have recreational experience with and I know they calm me down and shut off my (excess) of emotions.

2025-11-04 20:29:23;RSD, avoidance, and finding new friends;"Late diagnosed. Masked so hard that I ended up letting go of a bunch of friendships.. because every day I would decide that I didn't have enough energy to check or answer DMs. This went on for years before diagnosis when I was balancing on the edge of burnout from just doing the bare minimum.

Now I only have a few close friends left, all of them men who live far away. I recognize that I still have an avoidant attachment style even after years of working on it - that's the reason why I've felt more comfortable opening up to strangers online than people I know IRL. And those few people I have been genuine with have turned into longterm friendships.

Now, I'm trying to slowly unmask and be more open and genuine. And it feels like each time I try, RSD slaps me in the face. I decided to pitch in and share my opinion on a topic that was discussed during lunch today, and while I rationally know that people can disagree and it's no big deal, it still hit me like a ton of bricks. 

And it hit me that ""this is why I only have a few one-on-one friendships"". I don't feel like it's worthwhile to have relationships where I have to mask anymore, I hate rejection so much that I'd rather not talk to anyone.

I long so much for community, but I feel like I'm too broken to have friends or make new friends without masking too hard or being too fake. I want to get to know other women with ADHD IRL, but I have no idea where to find you!

2025-11-04 20:12:56;Does anyone know what the diagnostic rate is for women vs men that have actually been assessed?;"I'm a 32 y/o female and I've just had my assessment for ADHD and was not diagnosed. Despite this I still feel very strongly that I have it. 

She said that many of my adult symptoms are indicative of inattentive ADHD but there's not enough evidence of it in childhood. The problem is, I asked my mum to fill in the childhood form (there's no one else that could have) but she doesn't take it seriously and just brushes off so much of what I say even though she knows it's true. She is very likely to also have ADHD herself aswell as my sister. So she just doesn't remember stuff/forgotton/didn't notice which could partly be due to issues in my childhood and a very turbulent relationship with my father who had an addiction. The trouble is, I struggled with school quite alot even though I did well in the end because I repeated exams and went back to do an access course after a-level. My mum doesn't recognise any of that, and I can't remember much before my teens only that I struggled at school, and I don't know whether that was to do with daydreaming etc. And my mum just says 'I seemed a confident child'. I also have epilepsy and absense seizure so it would also be tricky to tell with the daydreaming/concentration etc. I was told by teachers in sixth form that I struggled to keep up, and they weren't sure if I was understanding (they were right - I understood alot more by self study taking it slowly). So feeling quite unheard and invalidated. The trouble is I just can't remember all these details. I feel terrible feeling so frustrated at her but she clearly doesn't think ADHD is real and she's not thought about the questions enough, and when I've mentioned things she's always had a ""but"" to it - meaning she does remember some things she just didn't note it!! I don't have any old school reports etc.

I felt so upset at the end of the assessment that I didn't really take in much of what she said. She said ""I can tell there's something running really deep here"". As far as I'm aware the main piece of advice was to offer me a dyslexia test. Something that I'm not very interesting in pursuing as it isn't going to help my deep depression, focus issues etc.

My assessor said I can still use what's in the report to inform my employers of how I need support but without a diagnosis I just don't feel comfortable saying that, or how I would handle that.

Can I ask for people who have been assessed:

-How much did the assessor ask about your grades at school? Mine just asked if I passed, which I did, scraping a pass. But I had to mention that. 
-Did they ask you about emotional dysregulation? This wasn't really asked.

Anyway, as an adult, she scored me the highest marks in all categories except for one where I was one mark off the max. My symptoms showed themselves in my late teens. I was a pretty normal kid playing Nintendo for most of my young life..

On the ""as a child"" part of the assessment, I was scored at basically zero and on that basis alone, she said it's ""other"" issues. She then said if it didn't manifest itself before you were 12, then it can't be ADHD, yet I'm at the highest end of the scale as an adult, which I am having a really hard time getting my head around.

2025-11-04 18:13:22;I never knew it affected me this much;I got diagnosed at 17 but never really cared to research since my ex told me ADHD was a label they used to ‘dull your spark’. We broke up, I went through crazy depression and at 19/20 finally realised how much adhd crippled my life. I didn’t start taking medication under supervision until roughly 2 months ago and I don’t know if its better or worse. I’ve been so emotionally unstable, I want to cry all the time but I don’t know if thats just seasonal depression. I’m at a pivotal moment in my life, I’m 22, in the last year of my undergrad and for once I feel totally inadequate. I compare myself to everyone, even the quality of my hobbies comes under scrutiny, I no longer feel hopeful about the future. I thought medication would fix me, or at least help me but instead it’s ruined me even more. I can’t seem to let go of bad habits or help myself. I don’t know what I want to do with my life and I’m terrified that I’ve wasted my potential constantly trying to self soothe and feel better in the moment - I have insane tunnel vision, the future feels far, the present is fleeting and I’m grasping for stability when I’m wired to be unstable. I know its my responsibility to fix myself, I know I could do more but I feel paralysed. The overwhelm leads to shut down more than action. How do I pull myself out of this rut? In a way I feel like learning more about adhd made me view myself negatively because I feel as though I’ve been automatically disadvantaged because of my brain. I do well academically, I believe I am capable if I put my all into it, but I don’t know how to make myself JUST DO IT. Ugh, I guess I just wanted to rant and see if anyone could relate or offer any guidance. The medication im on is lisdexamfetamine. Everyone talks about how life changing it is but all its done for me is break my skin out and make me emotionally unstable and somewhat focused (on the wrong things at times though like right now as I’m procrastinating doing my work through this post). ;r/adhdwomen;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oo3pjq/i_never_knew_it_affected_me_this_much/
2025-11-04 17:37:19;A weird habit of mine...?;"So, I have Adhd, but I have never been officially diagnosed, but at the same time I always knew that my brain works a bit differently than most of my friends (only ever had like 2 friends...?) or peers. But one of the many things that I do daily is that I run into things a lot, even if they are kept in front of me, my family always laughs at this, thinking that it's just me being reckless or clumsy (even tho I am a bit clumsy, but I don't think it's because of my clumsiness), my mother used to think that it's because of my eye sight issue as I wear spectacles, but my uncle who is an **Ophthalmologist** (in case if you are wondering why it's highligted because I GOOGLED it, Sorry I don't have enough barin cells to remember the spellings...lol...Sigh, I should probably get back to studying properly).... Anyway, he said that it cannot be because of my eyesight, as then I would be having trouble doing other things as well, and then all of them combined concluded that I am reckless. (what a great way of problem solving...tch), Now, here is the thing that they don't realise that my brain sometimes registers things a bit ""slowly"" (if that makes any sense?, idk how to explain it otherwise), even walking on the road is a huge task for me as my brain always gets confused about where to focus either walking, looking fowrad or looking down to see if I am not stepping on anything or to watch-out for vechials, I don't know if it'a an Adhd thing, thought to share it with y'all, (Thank you for reading my yap. :D)";r/ADHD;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oo35a3/a_weird_habit_of_mine/

I take 40 mg Ritalin Adult in the morning and 20 mg in the afternoon. The first weeks were great, I noticed my head was calmer, I didn’t move so much, and I could do the things I had to do. After a few months, I noticed that I’m overall feeling better. I don’t feel burnt out and bad all the time, I mostly feel fine.
The thing is, I’m somehow doing less than before. 
Before, I was always really hard on myself when I didn’t do the things I had to do. When I didn’t work out, I felt bad and punished myself. Now I’m not punishing myself so much anymore, which feels good but because of this, I don’t do as many things either. I stopped going to the gym. It’s okay for me, but I kind of want to go as well.
I could just sit in my room and play video games all day, now not full on shame but feeling good while doing it. And honestly, this is a bit confusing. Uni and my job are going alright, I just do the things that have to be done, and that’s it.

Now I feel a lot of bitterness and resentment towards it. 

When I got the diagnosis I was filled with hope and purpose. Thinking I finally knew how to just get ""me"" to do the work. Meds did help a bit, but its like 40-50% better  which still leaves a lot. I'm still working on it, but it is a slow process.

Recently I've felt a wave of bitterness overcoming me. Alot of how things maybe could've been different if I had found out earlier in life. But also just everyday annoyances have become bigger and bigger. Like every little adhd symptom that shows its face during the day, has just become a reminder of how much extra work I have to do. Just to reach the non-adhd baseline.

I was never really a stereotypical ADHD kid, so when I saw videos about adhd, I would have some of the symptoms, but not as extreme as in the videos, so I never thought I had it, and for some reason, I still don't, even with the official diagnosis.

2025-11-04 12:38:58;RSD BPD/adhd;"Hi -
As I write this I feel terrified and so very alone.
I am also, so, so angry and resentful.
You see, I feel angry at people with ADHD - I am unsure if I have it or I have become so very good at masking, until it all explodes.
It's the whole rejection sensitive dysphoria thing.
I got a diagnosis of Borderline 40 years ago. So 40 years of being blamed for what I felt was out of my control, 40 years of being blamed for my own sexual assaults and experience of DV.
I have experienced so much shame and stigma because of the bpd diagnosis: I have some traits, but only 2 of them that I can identify. So then it was Cptsd, except I don't have childhood trauma. I was teased and bullied, and I remember crying a lot because I just didn't fit in with others and got rejected a lot.
I 'taught' myself how to fit in by watching movies (how dumb is that?) and observing what the 'popular' girls did at school.
I can 'function' fairly normally, but it's only though intense discipline or notes/lists to avoid things going wrong. So I often 'appear' functional, but if I make a mistake, can't meet a deadline, or let people down...it's THEN that I collapse like I have been punched it the gut. And I can't deal with the 'strong emotions'..but there is always, always a trigger - they do not come out of nowhere.
All my life I haI feel l've been called a Dreamer, who can't stick at things (I can if I get a dopamine hit).- I get so easily bored and can't commit to things.
Then I see some 20 year old on tiktok talking about RSD and it's part of being ND, and how validated they feel.
So I guess I am just a jealous resentful old nobody.
I don't hate people with adhd - my daughter has it.
I just needed to vent about it as the diagnosis of BPD has ruined my life - and I just want it to be all over

2025-11-04 12:25:05;Can any 40 year old, working moms relate?;"Hey, 

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. But I am having a difficult time lately and I’m just curious if anyone else has noticed a shift in their moods/energy. 

I have noticed the last couple of days that I have been feeling really down, tired, irritable, cranky and finding it impossible to complete tasks or even to find the energy to start tasks especially around the house. Everyday things are a STRUGGLE lately, and all I want to do is sit on my couch. Not being productive or doing “house work” makes me feel like I’m letting someone down, not living up to expectations or being the best version of myself. I constantly feel the need to be doing something, complete a task or stay active. I fear that my kids will think I’m lazy, and when they grow up think of their childhood as “mom relaxing on the couch”. I also don’t want my hubby to think I’m lazy and don’t do anything around the house. 

I am a mom, I work as a bartender/server on the weekends, and I have a possible ADHD diagnosis; in the process of being evaluated. I have had two therapist recommend that I get evaluated for ADHD, but I have had a psychiatrist suggest either ADHD or Bipolar. I don’t think I’m bipolar, I think it’s ADHD. 

I am also on anxiety meds and depression meds. And I take vitamins that help with mood, energy, stress and motivation.  I’m not sure if seasonal depression is creeping up, the weather change is causing the shift in my mood and drive or if my dopamine is empty. 

Anyone else experiencing a shift in their mood, energy and overall just mental state?

2025-11-04 12:08:58;ADHD is ruining my life;"I’m an Asian woman about to turn 30, recently diagnosed with ADHD. Growing up, I was called “lazy” and “irresponsible” because I was always late and procrastinated. My parents don’t believe in ADHD—they think I just lack discipline.

Right now, I’m living with them, working part-time, and barely have any savings. I feel guilty depending on them when they’re getting older and deserve support from me instead. I want to make them proud, but I keep falling short.

The pressure to live up to the “hardworking, successful Asian” stereotype eats at me. Everyone around me seems to have stable careers, marriages, and homes, while I’m still struggling. ADHD makes everything harder—I’m late to work, distracted, forgetful, and rarely finish what I start. I feel ashamed, like I’m failing at being an adult.

Dating feels impossible. I’m scared no one would want me because I don’t feel like I have anything to offer. I want a family someday, but I can barely manage myself. I have only two close friends, and even with them, I struggle to keep in touch. I want to meet new people, but I’m afraid of being judged for where I am in life.

School has been another constant battle. I’ve switched majors multiple times—pre-nursing, general studies, graphic communications, web development—and now I’m pursuing an online computer science degree. It costs $4,200 a term, but I barely engage with the material. Deep down, I know it’s because I’m not truly interested and find it hard to focus.

After my ADHD diagnosis, I tried non-stimulant medications like bupropion and atomoxetine, but they didn’t help. I’ve been trying to get stimulant meds, but insurance issues keep delaying things. Even making the calls to fix it feels overwhelming.
I feel stuck in a cycle—wanting to get better but unable to take the steps I need. I’m tired of hating myself. I just want to feel capable, confident, and proud of who I am.";r/ADHD;459;56;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1onxsny/adhd_is_ruining_my_life/
2025-11-04 11:57:51;Questions about college accommodations;"I just finished my GED in my 20's, and school has always been extremely difficult for me. I was never given accommodations because I got diagnosed after dropping out of high school, so I'm a little lost as to what's out there and what could potentially help me. I have a few months to fully figure all this out but I'm very lost on where to even start with all this.

1. Does the college just get to decide what accommodations work for you and that's it? 

2. Is there things I could be doing on my own to accommodate myself other than medication and therapy? 

3. Will my doctor be the one to decide the accommodations in the note she writes to prove that I need accommodations? ";r/adhdwomen;4;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1onxkri/questions_about_college_accommodations/
2025-11-04 11:57:07;Living with others - I just can’t do it.;"I’ve been living alone for about 3 years now(my 17yo daughter comes over 1-2 times a week to hang out for a few hours)

Prior to that I was in a relationship for 19 years and at least 1 kid as well as ex at home for those 19 years.

I was only diagnosed with ADHD coming up 4 years ago, I’m 53.

I’ve been in a long distance relationship for about 3 years, catch up every 2 weeks or so.

As things progressed, she was keen to eventually move in together, I was adamant from the start though that I just don’t see myself living with anyone ever again as I just want too much me time.

The thought of living with anyone, partner, flatmates etc…just seems these days to be something I don’t want to do.

2025-11-04 11:47:04;I feel like the whole world has a group chat without me…;"What the title says,

I (19F) do not fit in. Growing up there were CLEAR signs of ADHD but didn’t get diagnosed until this year when college made it unavoidable.

I do (for the most part) get along with people. But I always feel like I’m putting on a performance. I have a handful of friends I feel genuinely comfortable around, that fill my cup, and let me be more myself, but no matter what it feels like I’m missing something. Like there’s a wavelength that everyone is on that I’m not. I never feel truly seen, I rarely fit in with girls my age, it’s very hard to find people that share my interests (they can be rather specific/niche). Even in my current friend group i feel as if im on the outside looking it behind a window. People tend to think I’m funny, I have a sense of humour and I know when and how to make a joke, that’s often how I try to connect with people.

Everyday interactions with strangers or people like my neighbours are insufferable. I hate small talk, I’m bad at it. All I can think about is what facial expressions to make, when to make eye contact and when to break it. When I see people on the walking trail I avoid eye contact and speed up so I don’t have to do the awkward smile thing. I also just find most people to be shallow and boring. I don’t say that to be mean, they haven’t done anything wrong, it’s just really difficult for me to connect or bond with most people. I’m always seen as weird or too much, People think I’m quirky, strange, out of pocket, etc. And for the select close friends I have, they accept me and I don’t feel like I have to try AS hard. But with most people, even though we “get along” I never really get close. Just to be clear: I’m not socially anxious so much as I’m clueless.

I don’t understand social rules, I feel like I do and say the wrong thing a lot. I just want to know if anyone else feels that’s any or if there’s any advice y’all have.

2025-11-04 11:24:56;Or lack thereof?;"I’m at a loss.

TLDR: I know that I have adhd. I’ve tried everything else. But I can’t get medicated. I don’t know what else to do. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health my entire adult life (F28). I had to take time off in college, have been on every anxiety/depression med there is, in and out of different therapists dozens of time (I don’t think talk therapy is for me, but I keep trying). I had a counselor in college suspect OCD. That seemed to fit with my symptoms, but never had an official diagnosis. Finally 2 years ago I had a counselor who suggested I get tested for adhd. It had never ever occurred to me that I might have it. I always did well in school, I’m historically super organized, etc etc etc UNTIL about 2 years ago. Idk what changed. I just cannot get my life together. I don’t know how else to describe it. more to come on that in p2.
I go through this insanely long process, wait 7 months for the appointment, there’s an initial talk therapy appointment, then a 3 hour test, then a third appointment for analysis etc. According to this guy who did my testing, u do have OCD, severe anxiety, some depression, and am “right on the line” for ADHD. So I’ve been medicated for ODC for about a year and it really has changed my life in those ways (fluvoxomene). But I feel like since I’ve gotten my OCD symptoms under control, ADHD symptoms have blown up.

First and foremost, I CANNOT get out of bed. I used to be such a morning person. Managed a bakery for years. Up at 3am happily. Now I set my alarm for 6 and snooze. And snooze. And snooze. For literally hours. It’s not that I can’t wake up. It’s not that I’m sitting in my bed on my phone. I just NEED to keep hitting snooze. It used to be until the last second, but recently now I’ll snooze until I’m an hour or 2 late for work. I love my morning routine. It’s entailed, I do yoga, breakfast, read, some chores, etc. and the few times I’ve been able to motivate myself to get up and do it (when I have something worth getting up for), I feel great. I KNOW that snoozing makes me angry, anxious, depressed. Yet I still do it every. single. day. And I’m SO tired, all day, no matter what. I go to bed at a decent time. Sure could be better, but I’m usually in bed by 10. 

There’s so many other things I could list but that’s really the main thing that’s truly ruining my life. I miss appointments constantly. I’m late for work. Even on weekends I’m rushing in the mornings getting to things I WANT to do. 

So. I’ve been seeing a new therapist who I really really like for about 3 months now. Honestly this is the longest I’ve ever seen one person. She is so convinced I have ADHD. I’ve never even brought it up to her. But she’s had me take a few unofficial tests and they’ve all come back “positive.” She asked me to ask my prescriber (with the same company who did my official testing) if they would give me adhd meds. My prescriber adamantly said no. (I’ve never really liked this person). She pulled up my test. Had a hard time deciphering the results because “in one place he says you don’t have it and in another he says you do.” Asks if I want to increase my fluxov (this is all she ever suggests). Suggests that I’m just depressed. Says that they would treat anxiety and depression before they’d treat adhd anyway (???????? This feels weird to me. Lots of people are depressed BECAUSE of adhd/other diagnosis, which is where I feel my depression is coming from). She kept saying “well [dr. who did my test] has a PHD.” As if that’s that. I understand this was an extensive test, but this guy talked to me for 2 total hours 2 years ago. I see my prescriber for maybe 5 minutes every 3 months. Meanwhile my therapist I see every week for an hour. Like I said before, why isn’t it a possibility that treating my OCD symptoms made room for ADHD symptoms to really shine? 

This post doesn’t even scratch the surface of all my frustrations and issues over the last several years. I literally don’t know what else to do. I guess I’m looking for advice, encouragement, validation? ";r/adhdwomen;2;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1onwx9z/or_lack_thereof/

It’s the worst when the small talk is an obstacle for something I’m focused on (going home, finishing a task, working, etc.) The best way I can describe it is presenting totally normally outwardly(I hope), but inside I’m wishing I could just rip my skin off and jump into the ocean…some of the most evil and violent visions. I am so bad at boundaries, interrupting people, and the art of ending conversations. After the conversation and I realize how much time and energy that took for absolutely no gain…I literally have to take a step away, take deep breaths, scream, or something.

2025-11-04 09:37:08;I'm a high school student, I used to get good grades in math and now I'm just failing. Is there a way to study efficiently for a student with ADHD?;"Hello everyone, 

English isn't my first language, therefore, I'm sorry if my post isn't clear enough.

I'm a french high school student with ADHD, I'm graduating this year but I've lost all confidence and motivation because of my bad grades. This post is specifically about mathematics.

I'm in a particular case where I only have three subjects this year, while the two other subjects aren't a problem for me, one is: math. I thought having a schedule adjustment for my ADHD would help me as I get more time to study at home. However, it seems to be everything but helpful.

I used to be a straight A student, I didn't need to study and I barely listened to class during my previous years of school. I don't have any experience in studying correctly so it quickly becomes dreadful and it takes me hours to just solve a whole sheet of homework. 

I have retaken this year because I simply couldn't achieve good grades and I felt extremely overwhelmed and pressured by not being good at school.

I got diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, I'm 18 now. I have noticed my grades going downhill when I started 11th grade (the US equivalent to ""la première"" in France, a year before senior year.) and it totally hit me right in the face. I have a poor mental health, and my bad grades made it worse. 

When you suddenly go from being top class to mediocre, it just makes you feel like the biggest failure and disappointment your family could ever have, especially in an asian household where everyone gets good grades and end up in great colleges. FYI, I'm the only one known among my cousins to have an ADHD.

I could study for hours, work hard, redo my homework twice until I fully understand what I'm doing. I still don't get grades above average. I really (try, at least) work hard. 

Now, I'm wondering if any of you were in the same case as me and could possibly share tips to study and improve.

I'm open to answer any questions to enlighten any of you to understand my situation better.

Thank you!

2025-11-04 09:26:35;Need advice around managing my anxious attachment and ADHD with an AuDHD partner;"I (37F) was diagnosed officially with ADHD this year. My partner (43F) is AuDHD and we’ve been together for 7.5 months, although we were friends for a number of years before that. We are both in therapy and both have official dx.

I struggle with an anxious attachment style, which I’m also realizing now could be worsened by ADHD emotional disregulation around rejection (or a combo of both). I am fairly certain that my partner is securely attached, this feels like the safest most secure relationship I’ve ever had. She never ghosts or goes silent on me even when we are in conflict. We communicate so well and are so gentle and sweet with each other and we always prioritize repair after conflict, something neither of us really were able to do in previous relationships. I’m honestly so in love and I wanna do everything to make this work, but I’m really afraid I might fuck it up.

I’m used to dating avoidant people, which has definitely made my anxious attachment fears worse in the past. Because my partner is AuDHD, she struggles with executive functioning and if she’s over tired or mentally out of spoons she has a hard time being emotionally available in the same way she normally is. I have a hard time understanding it because I feel I’m able to be emotionally present for her no matter what personal struggles I’m dealing with. This has caused my deep fear of abandonment to flair when her communication style changes - I’m hyper-vigilant to try and spot avoidance or pulling away and I often bring it to her attention in those moments which really confuses her.

So first, is it reasonable to ask someone with AuDHD to find a way to stay emotionally available/present even when they’re at low capacity? Or do I need to find a way to just accept that when she’s in that headspace I won’t get those needs met and need to find another way to feel safe because we are both living with a disability and can’t help it? Or a combo of both? And how?

Second, I’m well aware that most of this is my ADHD and attachment style and I honestly feel like I don’t know how to work on it. I have a lot of techniques for regulating but they usually only work temporarily until I’ve fully snapped out of it. I have tried communicating clearly what I need from her in those moments but she doesn’t always remember to do it or doesn’t always have the capacity. Logically, I want to be accepting of that but in those moments I’m so triggered that I can’t talk myself down from thinking she’s changed how she feels or that I’m an emotional burden. I watch myself picking fights out of nowhere to get the attention from her that I feel I’m not getting and I feel embarrassed that I’m still doing that at my age and can’t stop myself but in the moment I truly can’t.

So I guess I’m asking if anyone has been in a relationship where this dynamic was present? And I’m looking for resources to both manage my own emotional deregulation around perceived rejection and anxious attachment and also try to understand the autism side of things because often times she triggers me without meaning to thinking she’s saying a harmless thing. I don’t wanna sabotage the best relationship I’ve ever had and I’d love some guidance!";r/adhdwomen;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1onudyp/need_advice_around_managing_my_anxious_attachment/

Coupling that with being sober for the first time in 5+ years has really opened my eyes and helped me take stock of the life I’ve created for myself, as well as my own personal quirks. My question is this; why is it so hard for me to admit I’m not perfect and need help and support sometimes? Obviously I’m not perfect, nor do I think I actually am, but I feel embarrassed and ashamed when I admit that I’m struggling or need help. I’ve gotten better at it, but there’s still a huge amount of shame involved when I’m not my best. I’m an RN working through an NP program at a good school, I’m self-sufficient, I have good friends and a good support system.

I got into my current job prior to that and need to stay in it for various reasons. It's not a good match for my AuDHD way of being and I take a pretty big mental hit despite having improved how I approach it informed by AuDHD knowledge I now have. So at the moment my options for improving my state of being are what I do outside of work hours.
I really like being active but the work impact has led to me being the opposite & so I'm trying to establish an exercise habit. I like regular exercise but it's not something I've done before, in the past it's been, well, random, spontaneous outdoors things.
I also used to draw a lot as a kid, wanted to be an artist but was discouraged from pursuing, not practical etc., so getting back into that is the 2nd habit I want, and maybe an eventual change of life direction. 🤞
I love doing both things, and they help with the work impact a huge amount, but every time I get a hint of a routine going I'll eventually get a sudden aversion reaction to the routine, a strong need to be spontaneous and have variety. Apps that remind me and show progress help, but eventually lose to the need for something different. I always think I'll have a break for a day, but it ends up being 2 then more & inevitably I'm back at struggling with resistance to getting back into the activities even though I know they'll make me feel so great. Before long I'm back to the after-work brain-numb person who wants nothing than blob on the couch.
I don't want to try to turn myself into someone fundamentally different, I like being me, including my seeming conflicting needs for both structure/regularity and variety/spontaneity - it feels like my ying & yang, who I am at my core. But I really want to establish my two new lifestyle habits. I'm keen to hear if anyone has found a way to balance this in their life, and what worked.

2025-11-04 08:31:48;Considering trying to get an adhd diagnosis in the UK;"I am a 19(f) and in first year of university and have been wondering if I have adhd for the last few years. However it’s only been since I started uni and have to self-regulate (which I find extremely hard) that I’m starting to think it might be worth trying to get a diagnosis. The main issue is I build stuff up in my head quite a lot and if I put all the effort in to try and get diagnosed and then find out I don’t have it, I’ve not only wasted peoples time but have also confirmed I am the only person to blame for my laziness and inability to reach my full potential. I was wondering if I could list some of the things I struggle with and think are relevant so people could advise if it would be worth trying to get a referral? I’ve tried to be really strict with this list and not exaggerate in any way because I want to be as realistic as possible.

obsessively pick skin- can be for over
an hour or until my face is red raw and despite how bad I know it is I can never stop 
(I’ve done this since I was around 13)

extreme procrastination- left revising for my most of my GCSEs until the morning of (I would set an alarm at 4am and work for four hours straight trying to cram it all at once because I can only work under high pressure)

I cannot stick to anything, probably one of the reasons I didn’t do as good as I wanted at art a-level because I would randomly start a painting and paint for ten hours straight then give up and never touch it again because I lost all motivation despite the fact I put so much initial effort into it
I would do this with all pieces of art coursework, sometimes even ignoring actual coursework to paint whatever I suddenly wanted to do that day

I get extremely overwhelmed when I have multiple tasks to do and struggle to achieve even one of them because I feel weighed down how big all the tasks seem to me
This is also why I put off doing my work, once I start I realise how far behind I am and then get so scared I stop 

I cannot listen in lectures at all, my attention span probably lasts for ten minutes before I start talking to myself in my head and pre planning conversations to have later 
And then when I realise I’m doing it I try to listen but I’m unable to focus and feel defeated because I’m already so lost

My head is never quiet I am continuously speaking to myself in my head at an extremely fast pace and sometimes zone out because I get so distracted by talking to myself in my head 

I often speak really fast and can’t help myself from interrupting conversations because I have so much to say
I get told that I talk too much all the time- however if I feel uncomfortable in a social setting I am able to control this because I feel so awkward 

My teachers all used to think I was smart because I was very good at participating in class and I’d always have extremely high predicted grades, however when it came to exams I’d usually do good but nowhere near as good as they thought I could do because I could never make myself put the work in until the last very minute
My parents would also always comment on my exam results because although to some they would be very good, my parents knew I didn’t put enough effort in and thought I could do better (honestly not sure if I could of though)

I thought that she would stop getting super mad at me when I messed up, but that hasn’t been the case. She seems to get super upset at me especially for forgetting to do things, and has a  “How could you POSSIBLY forget to do this?” mentality.

Just a couple of minutes ago she called me and got mad at me about forgetting to do something at school and all I could do was sit there and listen to her dig into me, and it makes me incredibly upset, because she literally has ADHD too?? 

She’s also said some stuff to me along the lines of “Your ADHD didn’t make you do this, you’re just lazy.” And “Try using a planner!” (Even though I’ve told her multiple times that planners don’t work for me.) 

I don’t know what to say to her. I just want her to stop. Our relationship got so bad a couple of years back my heart would starting racing the moment she opened the door because I knew she would starting tearing into me about something I did, and I wouldn’t have an explanation for her because all I could do was sit there and sob.

How could I possibly get her to understand I’m not doing these things on purpose/get her to be more understanding when she literally has ADHD herself?

2025-11-04 06:54:39;anxiety over test at appt;"I (39F) was diagnosed adhd when I was 15 years old and was prescribed ritalin at first, then adderall. It worked well and I stayed on it until I got pregnant at 20. I never got back on it and somewhat assumed I didn’t need it anymore because I wasn’t in school. At 31 I had my 4th child and a surgery at 33. The reason I mentioned those events is because that’s when I felt my adhd “came back” 10x worse than I ever experienced before. Now, I finally had an appointment to get back on medication because my adhd is impacting my life to a point where I can’t stand myself sometimes. At the appointment, I was told I will have to come back and take a test on a computer..something to do with pressing something when i see a letter X on the screen. I’m so worried that I’m not going to “pass” this test and then won’t be helped with a prescription. I know without a shadow of a doubt that if any doctor watched me in the wild, they’d be able to tell from a mile away that i have severe, unmanageable adhd. I’m also very good at masking, so I’m pretty sure that at appointments I come across as completely fine and possibly drug seeking. 

Has anyone taken this test? Can anyone give me an idea of what to expect or what they’re looking for me to do or not do? I’m so stressed about this appointment tomorrow because so much is relying on me getting a medication that i KNOW works well and being able to function as an adult. I’m scared I’ll somehow come across as atypical and then the whole cycle of finding a new doctor, making the appointment, actually attending the appointment, yadda yadda will start all over again..

TLDR; I have to take an adhd test on a computer and would like a heads up on what it entails so that I can be medicated and functioning again. ";r/ADHD;2;6;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1onqui1/anxiety_over_test_at_appt/
2025-11-04 06:27:26;Can't stop stressing out;"Hello,

I am 25F diagnosed with ADHD. I am the eldest of three sisters, and even though my parents have not made me responsible or made me take care of my sisters as a primary caregiver growing up, I somehow have this innate sense of responsibility towards them, and I really absorb all the stresses and the negative emotions that they experience.

 So, recently my sister started undergrad, and she moved to a different country, and she's been struggling with her grades, residence permit paperwork etc. Sometimes she also lies or hides her problems so that she does not get into trouble. So, it just makes me anxious, and I just don't know what to do. Like, I try to help her but I can't do much or anything instantly. I get really anxious and overwhelmed to the point that it affects me physically as well.

2025-11-04 06:12:17;Seeking diagnosis and treatment as an adult, but terrified that nobody will believe me;"
Hiiii guys 
Alright. Gonna try and sum up my whole life real fast but basically I was diagnosed with adhd when I was 14. The psychiatrist prescribed me adderall, but my parents are natural hippies so they refused to fill the prescription and we never talked about it again. I was a “gifted” child after all, so they didn’t really believe it.

Through the years, I’ve developed ways to coast by in school. One million reminders on my phone everyday and lots of sticky notes and a planner. On top of that there was a lot of pressure for me to perform well in school so I kind of just coasted by and even took lower level classes than I could handle just because the focus aspect was too much for me but I would be punished if I didn’t get straight As.

I took some time off after graduating high school, and college has just been a shit show. It’s ten times harder than high school was, and on top of that I was diagnosed with lupus 2 years ago. Through my time in college, I’ve taken several gap semesters because it gets so overwhelming. The brain fog due to lupus has made all my symptoms 10x worse. Through the years, I’ve used kratom (an herbal supplement from the gas station lmao) because it’s the closest I can get to feeling focused. However, it makes me feel super nauseous and even more so with my lupus meds. Over the past year, my roommate has been sharing her adderall with me once per week. I know, I know, this is bad. But when I take adderall I feel like my old self, but better. I think about how high school could have been, how much I could have achieved if I wasn’t just trying to painfully coast by. I focus better on adderall, I sleep better, I have more energy.

I’m sure many of you have dealt with the medical system just… not listening to you as a woman. I have hundreds of my own stories. So now, I’m 25 years old, haven’t sought out help for adhd since I was 14, and I’m afraid that no doctor will believe me or they’ll just think I’m trying to get high. No. For over two years now my autoimmune disease has heightened my adhd symptoms and I feel like the most dysfunctional person ever. But then I gaslight myself because I manage to skate by with a million reminders and tons of caffeine. But I always feel like I’m drowning. I’ve honestly been putting it off and just trying to get adderall from my roommate because I’m so scared of not being believed but it’s not sustainable anymore.

How do I go about this? I’m so scared. But I’m at a point where I’ll be graduating in a couple semesters and I don’t know how I’ll manage that, much less finding and holding down a real job that isn’t so lenient about forgetfulness like my job as a waitress.

The sleep doctors dismiss me when I talk about my ADHD. They're more focused on my sertraline. I understand that sertraline can affect your sleep, but I had these issues before I took sertraline.

2025-11-04 05:51:56;How to start living live, knowing that for the past 29years, it was ADD that kept you from moving.;"hi!
I hope this sub is also for people with the inattentive type. I just got diagnosed and I honestly do not know what to do with this information yet. 

(And before i start, yes, i used a program to “smooth” my text, english isn’t my native language. i think it perfectly says what i wanted but it might sound unnatural to people who speak english natively thats why i wanted to tell you first.) however.. 

For 29 years I thought this is just who I am. Slow. Calm. No internal urgency. No drive to start things even if I want to. Always stuck in ideas. Watching life happen around me without being able to actually get moving. I never thought of ADHD because I always imagined the hyperactive version. People who talk fast and move a lot. I felt like the complete opposite.

Last year I learned about the quiet version of ADHD. And suddenly everything made sense. The mental paralysis. The overthinking. The constant planning without doing. Feeling like I am capable but somehow unable to access it. Like I am always waiting for something to switch on in my brain.

Now I am sitting here and thinking… what now. How do you start changing when you have spent almost 30 years thinking you are just lazy or slow or not built for life. I never believed I could ever be someone who takes action and follows through. Now I am realizing maybe I can but I have no idea where to begin.

If you also found out late that you have inattentive ADHD, please tell me what helped you. How did you start getting unstuck. How did you build momentum when your brain never naturally gives you that push.

Any advice or just personal experiences, stories, would help a lot. I feel weirdly relieved but also overwhelmed and kind of lost. ";r/ADHD;302;35;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1onp8ps/how_to_start_living_live_knowing_that_for_the/
2025-11-04 05:43:17;Have yall felt like your medication isn’t working anymore?;"
Hi y’all! So I need some help figuring out how to handle my ADD. I’m 23F and was diagnosed with inattentive-type ADD when I was 19 (though honestly, I think the hyperactive side shows up mentally since my brain is always racing). When I first started medication, it was beautiful. I realized I’d basically been doing everything on hard mode before.

I started with Ritalin, but it made me super angry and agitated, so my doctor switched me to Concerta ER 18mg when I was 20. I’ve been on that ever since, and it’s worked way better overall. For context, I’m also on Lexapro for anxiety.

A little background: I’m pre-med. I finished my master’s in medical sciences last year and now work full-time in healthcare while studying for the medical entrance exam.

But for about a year now, I’ve felt like my medication just doesn’t hit the same. I’ve read that this can happen because the initial dopamine boost wears off, and while it’s technically still working, it starts to feel more “routine.” The problem is, I can’t just ignore that anymore as it is causing me to leave a lot of important tasks incomplete. I live alone, and balancing work, studying, and regular life stuff has become so hard. I get maybe two good hours of focus a day, then I’m totally drained. It’s even starting to affect my basic routines like meal prepping or keeping a decent diet.

So I’m just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and what helped. Did you end up switching meds? Or were there lifestyle habits or routines that made a difference? I’m genuinely desperate and am going crazy trying to read all the ADHD research and decide what to do. I’d really appreciate hearing what worked for y’all. Thanks so much!";r/adhdwomen;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1onp0kc/have_yall_felt_like_your_medication_isnt_working/
2025-11-04 05:31:00;How do I get back on track ?;"1I have lost all sense of purpose. My ADHD has gotten worse. I can't seem to stop chasing dopamine every second of my life. I feel hollow but full at the same time—like when you eat junk food, your stomach feels full, but it’s nutritionally empty. And when that feeling of fullness wears off...

I've told my one and only best friend about my ADHD, and guess what? She doesn’t understand. She’s not intrigued. I don’t think I can expect a person without ADHD to truly understand, especially at our age (we’re 16). I don’t think she realizes that ADHD does impact my life—and maybe, to some extent, I’m the one avoiding being vulnerable about it.

I can’t focus on school, even though the subjects I opted for are my special interests. I can’t sleep on time—or more like, I sabotage my own circadian rhythm because I can’t stop binge-reading manga late at night.

I have over 300 hobbies(okay, that was hyperbolic) but none of them seem intriguing at the moment. I’m lonely. And as for my parents… I tried talking about ADHD with them, to no avail. They don’t acknowledge any brain differences. Because I seem “normal” to them, the idea that I might have a disorder is baffling.

I’m not diagnosed. I can’t sit still for a moment without needing mental stimulation. I’ve lost track of time. And I fear that, in the future, I’ll rot in my parents’ house.

2025-11-04 05:30:58;Bupropion perscribed but no official diagnosis yet... I have to wait three weeks for it;"I have a lot of traits described as ADHD, ability to hyperfocus, executive dysfunction, and a working memory deficit.

I have always been the messy disorganised kid, I've always been considered smart/intelligent, and all my report cards from first grade are just the same-- Extraordinary but moody. In later life the word 'careless' was also included.

I have always been under pressure to perform and I've never been able to actually do anything unless I'm under pressure. I have really bad working memory deficits, I struggle to remember birthdays of people who I love and care about, sometimes I forget last names of my friends and I feel so guilty but I cant help it.

However, here's where I differ. I CAN focus, but it requires a lot of effort and when im done i feel exhausted. Even things I love like being with my friends, I feel so happy in the moment but as soon as they're gone I feel like I need to lay down and scroll for hours. Now when it comes to hyperfocus, I can listen to lectures that are visual (helps with my working memory issues cause diagrams just show the big picture and how things connect without having to remember every step) and very fast paced, i can sustain this high level of focus for hours on end, especially if the teacher is interactive. If a friend talks to me during such lectures I hate it and usually dont respond and just tell them we'll talk later. It is this hyperfocus that has helped me pass my first year of med school.

I can hyperfocus for so so so so many hours and it has no limit unless my body physically crashes. Sometimes I wanna leave but I can't. Nothing distracts me, nothing at all. The amount of focus I have is what made my doctor say that I dont fit the typical picture.

My working memory difference also shows up here: consider that there are 100 data points that both me and my friend will need to remember. My friend who probably has a greater working memory can probably remember like 80pc of them really well. Me, however, I cannot. I cope with this by drawing connections bw these data points until I see how they're all connected, and remembering only those ones that I can't recreate by following logical steps. So I remember 20 instead of the original hundred, but I can get to the 80 others by using those 20. It's like manually working out multiplication tables instead of memorising them. It's the only way I can survive academically.

However, I am struggling a lot at home particularly in the evenings after work with cleaning and chores. I've spoken to my psychiatrist about possibly having another dose of Ritalin during the evening right when I get home.

I've tried every method possible that was recommended including caffeine, charts, etc and I'm struggling to stay on task to the point that my room and house and laundry is honestly a huge disaster and I'm just like awful with chores.

I have friends who are on much higher doses and I don't even want or need like a high dose. I feel like that's a generally reasonable ask but maybe I'm wrong I don't know.

Was told I had generalized anxiety disorder for the next 12 or so years before adhd diagnosis in early 30’s.

My most prominent symptom has always been chest tightness, can’t get a deep enough breathe symptom(have had all the medical tests to rule out anything else over the years).

So just had my 2nd kid and also have a 4 year old and life is busier and more stressful than it has ever been on all fronts…home, work, just a constant full plate. In the months leading up to the birth of my second child I started getting this pretty constant spacey, hazy, like actual physically blurry vision symptom that’s persisted for the past 3-4 months(2nd child a month old for timeline).

With that being said I’m 34 and the last 3 years since being diagnosed with adhd have been the best I have had since that “switched” flipped at 18. In part to being prescribed adderall which has stayed between 20-30mg range and 40mg citalopram(first SSRI I ever took in early 20s and only one I felt ever helped before landing on adhd diagnosis). I’ll put it this way I felt good enough at the first of this year to very slowly taper off citalopram until completely off in June(medically supervised throughout). Even though hindsight now, I may have picked the worst time to come off of it with a kid coming in October lol. Let’s just say the citalopram was added back about a month ago but symptoms are still quite persistent.

Okay, so my stepdaughter is currently in the adolescent in-patient psychiatry unit at the local hospital. They are changing her medication and want to send her home mid-transition because they think it would be best. 

I keep trying to get them to listen to me and understand that she is not safe at home while the medications are being changed. Their strategies and therapies are not going to work because we have tried every single one over the past 5 years, and nothing sticks. She is unwilling to work on herself/her trauma and would rather let it dictate her entire life (at the moment). She may have been willing to work on herself back in the summer when she was asking for help, but her father blocked us from taking her to the hospital. She is now completely withdrawn, won't talk to any of us about anything significant/admit anything (ie she convinced our family doctor that her meds are working ""just fine"" when we can all tell they aren't working at all). They have a red light/yellow light/green light system for her that they treat as though it is the be all end all solution - despite there not being any consequences if she lies about her color and we aren't supposed to call her out on it.

Green sounds like manic with a dash of suicidal ideation
Yellow sounds like suicidal ideation
Red states she isn't safe but no where does she indicate suicidal ideation which no one seems to understand frightens me more than anything else.

They feel that we just need to monitor her carefully qhile she's at home.

I keep telling them I can't do this. 

I have 2 other step-daughters, one is in grade 11 and now self-medicating her anxiety with drugs so I have to nip that behaviour asap. My youngest (preteen) has decided that she hates being a part of our family and wants to live with her mom - but her mom doesn't want her more than once every 2 weeks. So she is targeting me insead. She doesn't listen, she swears at me, she throws things and last Monday she put hands on me while I was driving. They want to send my daughter (who is self harming and has had recent attenpts, and does not do well coming on/off antidepressants as it is) home and are telling me that I have to manage it. 

My husband leaves the house for work at 3am and doesn't get home until 7 or 8pm. I also work fulltime as a registered nurse. 

I am breaking apart at the seams. I already need to work OT every paycheck so I can cover my bills and I've also got to juggle three children with behaviours (basically solo), do the typical mom things (supper, homework, hygiene, laundry, looking after cats&dogs) daily, and on top of that they have tutoring because the youngest is dyslexic and the school board is ignoring us and not helping because the official diagnosis would be 3k that we do not have. 

I feel that I am justified in feeling overwhelmed, out of control, exhausted and angry/sad. I cried for 45 minutes in between patient's on Saturday because I am so stressed out. 

Daughter had a weekend pass, we dropped her off last night. The unit gave my husband a DBT workbook (designed for children/adolescents) to my husband to give to me because they ""aren't worried"" about my daughter, they are worried about me. It felt like a huge slap in the face. 

And when I tried to explain to my husband that I'm alone and it's hard and I can't handle it, his response is to tell me ""This is what you wanted"".

I don't think I'm anymore dysregulated than anyone else would be in my position. It feels very justified to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown, especially since the preteen's been targeting me for 8 months (I'm so numb to most of it now that other people will tell her off for being disrespectful and I will stare at yhem confused because that's just her baseline with me), and the self-harm from my middle daughter has been since the begining of the summer. 

Not to mention that she can't read tone so if I'm angry or upset with the preteen and the middle asks me something, and I'm a bit shorter than I mean to be, she immediately has a meltdown and loses her mind because I'm ""mad at her"" and nothing I say/do will change her opinion. It's like living with a bomb/walking on an eggshell minefield that will explode at any point in time. 

Her triggers are literally: anytime anyone asks her to do something she doesn't want to do. Oh and chores. 

Combined with a preteen who is intentionally targetting me.

It feels rational to be overwhelmed as all heck right now.

But I don't know if maybe I'm just so emotionally disregulated that I can't see things clearly anymore?

2025-11-04 01:56:10;Well I got diagnosed!;"I have been diagnosed with ADHD at the grand age of 27. I got asked what my goal was in getting diagnosed and if I wanted medication etc. I want to learn how to unmask and blend. Socially I appear very uptight, I freeze. Can’t talk and spend too much time thinking about what to say that the conversation is long gone. 

It’s a deep frustration that I have in my life. I feel so socially uncomfortable. When I enter social situations, it literally feels like I have been forcefully stripped of my clothing and made to walk around naked. Weird analogy but for me that’s how it feels. Hence why I adapted to drinking in order to socialise with other people. 

I gave up alcohol and I want to learn unmasking techniques. I was a carefree child, who would laugh and joke all the time. I would annoy and chat the ears off anyone who would listen to me. Sang my heart out and had so much fun. I locked that person away when I got into my teens and developed awareness of opinions and shame.

I want some of my old self back, not the part where I would blurt out things and end up in trouble of course. But the part of just being so comfortable and happy. I was wandering if anybody ever learned techniques or ways to unfold and to reduce masking behaviours. Thank you!

I jump from ”ofc I have it, it explains so much!” to ”who tf do I think I am, people with real ADHD hates people like me pretending to be special when in fact we have no idea what it’s really like”. Cause I DO have NO idea what it’s really like, I definitly don’t have those daily struggles and breakdowns that others have. Like someone said, ”people who say ’we all have a little ADHD’ wouldn’t survive a day in my messy brain”. I’m one of those people, thinking I’m one of you guys just because I’m a little slow in the start and unfocused. But my life is fine and I have no struggles. So why am I here? Why can’t I just let it go?

How can it be so hard? I’m so ashamed. Ashamed to be bad at so many things, and ashamed of being to high functional for diagnosis but still trying to squeeze in here like a pretending parasite.

2025-11-04 00:31:11;disclose at work? work problems with staying on top of things;"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with ADHD, and lately I’ve been struggling a bit at work — mainly with paperwork, follow-through, and staying organized. I genuinely try my best, but I can see how these things are starting to show, and I’m worried it’s reflecting poorly on me.

I’ve been going back and forth about whether to tell my employer. On one hand, disclosing might help me ask for accommodations or just explain why some things have been slipping. On the other hand, I’m afraid it’ll come across as making excuses or that I’ll be treated differently.

For those of you who’ve been in this situation:

* Did you disclose your ADHD at work?
* How did it go?
* What kinds of accommodations (if any) actually made a difference?
* If you *didn’t* disclose, how did you manage things on your own?

I’m just trying to figure out the best way to handle this without putting myself in a bad spot. Any personal experiences or advice would really help.

2025-11-04 00:22:53;The innate struggle of female friendships as an ADHD woman;"Growing up I always thought I did not have enough female friends or didn't get along with them probably because I grew up around brothers so I was more used to being around guys. That's just the logic my  tiny self came up with. Over time I saw it happen again and again. No matter which group , I got excluded or felt like a floater. At a certain point I accepted my fate as a floater, it was honestly heartbreaking and I was lonely , to feel like you dont belong anywhere is sad thing. I only accepted being a floater because that was my only option. 


This is a time skip now, I am 24 yrs now. I got my diagnosis last year and I have learned a lot  since then. It made me realise how much of my struggles with female friendships was mainly about my adhd (executive dysfunction and struggles with social cues) . Because I had adhd i never learned the social cues other women did. Girls were conditioned to be elegant, not loud , passive , indirect , etc. Its unfortunate but it does happen. I was infact not ""elegant"" , I was loud with my personality and my mouth, I talked a lot , probably interrupted a lot , I was direct which was unsettling for them. Infact in middleschool and high-school when I was getting bullied by my ""friends"" I could not figure out it was bullying. I could not know when people were mean or jealous and when i did feel something was wrong i was dismissed. I thought I did something wrong. I even tried asking. But now ik neurotypicals don’t talk things out most of the times. They let uk by hints that you dont belong or are accepted or needed. They will tell u they are direct but their definition of direct and upfront is different. Most of the times even a basic confrontation will result into you being ""too much"", Idk whether its mean or not but its something people do even as adults. 

My yearning for female friendship or girlhood will probably never die. I often tell my boyfriend how I wish I had just one female friend irl, whom I could talk with about makeup , stuff I like , clothes , nails, gaming , etc. But I do feel there is a huge chance I will never have it. Because I probably don't speak their language. I made it a call to keep my distance to save my self but even when I don't I have had people exclude me just because they assumed something about me and did not think to talk with me about it. Its difficult because I miss the social cues , I wish I was just like all the amazing women I see but I am not and idk how to be. I wish people would stop thinking that I am Shakespeare and my words have layers. I say what I say and I mean it exactly that way. My ""you are my friend"" is not ""i hate you"" . Maybe all of this sound dramatic but this has been my experience.  I still think girlhood is amazing , I just wish I could be a part of it. 


Edit note : I have realised that some people think or understood maybe by the way I wrote things. I dont in anyway mean that women are all just passive , indirect,  quiet and elegant (when I say elegant I mean more like the they laugh with grace, they sit properly , etc . Stereotypical stuff which again is not how everyone else sees as someone being elegant). What i did mean was, due to patriarchal norms,  women are imposed in their conditioning to be those things (to be more submissive) . Globally i could be 100% wrong but the country i grew up in has this as a norm, I live in a very patriarchal country where atleast i feel the conditioning for women is very regressive and oppressive.  So my experience comes from that place. Do I think its women's fault? Obviously not. Its subconscious and its their normal and also not all women actually end up falling into this conditioning. And regardless of whether they are this or not , I personally find women very amazing. I can't imagine looking down on them , that would mean I am looking down on myself. My feelings only came from the point of feeling that among all these incredible women I felt like a black sheep, like someone who just doesn’t fit in. Its not on them, its my issue and I don't blame anyone for it. ";r/adhdwomen;166;89;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ong7p6/the_innate_struggle_of_female_friendships_as_an/

2025-11-03 22:20:57;Is my therapist bad at being a therapist or am I just stubborn?;"This may be the wrong sub and I'm not quite sure how to explain this because I haven't had prior experiences with therapy, but I could really use any input or advice you guys have. 

This was my ""mental health year"" where I finally got an official ADHD diagnosis, started meds, and also therapy. I started seeing her earlier this year because I'm having a really hard time figuring out what I want in life, and generally feeling stuck. This includes my relationship. A few sessions in she asked if it would be fine with me and my partner if she joined us, and so she did. My therapist proceeded to, in a way, tear her apart. What I thought was going to be the start of better communication, like, ""what are the things that bother you but that you don't tell \[me\]"" or ""\[me\] feels xyz but feels you don't listen, what do you think you can do better"" was almost the full session of my therapist telling my girlfriend that she is really closed off, that she has attachment issues, trouble forming relationships etc etc. 

Now that's one part of it and part of the problem I now have is that my gf has such an issue with my therapist, that I can't sit down with her after a session and discuss concerns because she thinks my therapist ""is against her"" and mindfucking me to think about her differently. This is not true and part of some insecurities gf has, but I really feel it could have been better approached from therapists side?

  
My second issue is that I feel my therapist doesn't listen to me. I get that she sees multiple patients and whatnot, but you take notes right? Small example is that I mentioned I smoke last week and she was like ""I didn't know"" even though I've mentioned it more than once. That sounds stupid but it's a bunch of these little things, and then also bigger things:  
In our early sessions we did a few tests and deduced I have a secure attachment style. Today she brings up how anxiously attached I am and I was like hold up, that's not what we discussed? And she said she didn't bring her notes but she's sure of it.   
Other example is that I mentioned I was sexually assaulted as a kid last week, and she said she didn't know (I'm like 95% sure I did tell her), but that we definitely have to talk about it in today's session because it's important and may be affecting the way I feel about my relationship etc etc. Today comes and it's like I never mentioned that?? She just hopped into the session with type of flow chart thing that I can use to figure out what makes me happy?

Sorry for the long rant but I really need to know if I'm just being sensitive here or if she's actually bad at this therapy thing. Today's session was super frustrating for me.";r/adhdwomen;6;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ond082/is_my_therapist_bad_at_being_a_therapist_or_am_i/

Then in May this year I suffered a heart attack at the age of 48 and have been seriously depressed and traumatised since.

I noticed my depression was also better which this time of year my seasonal depression is always lingering but it is GONE. I weaned myself off my Wellbutrin and Lexapro just to see and its been a few days off of them completely and I still feel amazing.

Has anyone found that Ritilan helps with their depression and anxiety? My psych originally told me that the 3 are comorbidities and sometimes treating the ADD can help resolve the other two but after 4 different ADD meds with no change to the other two I didn't think it was possible.

Just wanted to see if anyone else went through this as well and if you decided to stop the meds for depression and anxiety or did you keep taking them.

But at the same time this is such a taxing and tiresome way to live, wish I could just stop and love the true friends I have and not really care about anyone else.

Throughout the years I've been struggling a lot mentally and I feel like things are just getting worse. I'm 35 now, I have a wonderful husband and two kids aged 6 and 5 but I'm really disappointed in myself as a mom and wife... 

* I struggle so much with keeping my focus en staying motivated for things.. 
* I get extremely interested in some things, start and invest in hobbies only to just forget about it after a few weeks.
* I’m always losing and forgetting things. I’ve locked myself out of my house countless times, it’s getting ridiculous.
* I’m really bad with money, always spending it on things I don't really need. Better now with my husbands help :-)
* I don’t have time blindness, more like the opposite. Always stressing about being late so I feel extremely rushed ALL the time. I feel like I'm also always unnecessarily rushing my kids and getting angry over 'not being on time' which I feel so bad for.
* I’m very social and extraverted at times but I’m always hyper aware of other peoples moods and my social battery runs empty really fast. I feel like I always need to ‘recover’ after seeing a lot of people. School holidays are really difficult for me because I really need some daily alone time to recharge
* I’m always thinking about food and find it impossible to eat mindfully so I’m just always overeating which makes me feel really bad afterwards… 

Ever since my oldest was born I noticed I started struggling a lot more with keeping focus and managing 'life' but after our second child I just feel so lost sometimes. I used to be very energetic, some people even finding me a bit 'too much' but I'm slowly feeling more and more exhausted to the point I get stressed about every minor thing.

Some days I'm like super mom and can handle everything but these days have become very rare.  
I'm sooo easily overwhelmed, my mind is always ON, there's always a random song playing in my mind even when I wake up in the middle of the night.  
I work from home so I find it very important to have a clean working space but I can’t seem to find the courage to get my workspace in order.

But the worst thing is that I’m feeling extremely angry over every minor thing and I snap at my kids all the time...   
It's like there's this constant rage in me and I get triggered over so many things.. I'm not the mom I used/want to be. On 'good' days I'm really calm and patient with my kids and I just want to always be that person for them… 

Becoming a mom really started to trigger a lot of things for me and I feel SO overwhelmed even though my life itself is very stable.   
I told my kids many times that sometimes it get's very busy in my head and they know I'm not angry at them but I noticed they start to get very aware and mindful of my mood and I'm scared it will affect them later in life if I'm always angry. 

Luckily my husband is really great, he understands me so much and is extremely helpful around the house, we can talk about everything and he quickly jumps in when he notices I’m feeling overwhelmed but I still can’t regulate my emotions. 

I’ve talked about this rage and feeling overwhelmed with my psychologist, she gave me some tips but nothing works. I just go from 0 to 100 when I’m overstimulated. I'm thinking about going to a different psychologist who specializes in ADHD...  I already talked to my general physician who was extremely nice and understanding and told me I very likely have ADHD.  
I decided I don't need to get officially tested since these tests are quite expensive and I don't need a diagnosis for my professional life since I'm self employed.  
But I finally feel seen AND heard and I'm trying to understand myself a little better. My GP gave me some tips on how to deal with symptoms, which were interesting and helpful but I find it difficult to implement them in my life.

I really feel like a stable lifestyle is really helpful, I really like routine and notice that my symptoms are much more manageable if I stick to that, eat healthy and especially sleep is super important. Drinking alcohol also makes me feel worse so I try to be mindful even though I really enjoy the silence a glass of wine brings :’) I try to add some walking to my daily routine but I noticed I’m already skipping more and more days… My GP prescribed Ritalin 10mg and told me I can take these when I know I’ll have a busy week.

I took my first pill this morning and I’m just feeling extremely anxious and not exactly extra focussed. 

Is this normal?

I had a very busy weekend and didn’t get a lot of sleep, I know this doesn’t help with the anxiety.

Does anyone have any tips for first time Ritalin use? Also, if anyone can give me some advise on handling anger and rage, please let me know.";r/adhdwomen;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1onam8r/overwhelmed_first_time_ritalin/

i got my formal diagnosis around 2-3 months ago, she had a comment of ""medication recommended"". i can feel myself slowly losing traction in my studies, since i am a very high achiever and am aiming to go into a top college. had very good grades until freshman year of hs where i had to start doing studying disproportionate to my peers for the same results

my parents are the roadblock to getting medication, i've heard so much good stories about it and i've repeatedly told them that i'm prepared for any side effects that may arise but my mom is really against it

she practices traditional chinese medicine which if you haven't heard abt before is 90% BS and is mostly placebo give or take a few that actually work, apparently it fixed severe eczema when i was younger and that's a lie because i still have eczema

she thinks that it'll throw off my ""chi"" or whatever since its an unnatural drug, i tried telling her how it's the same as caffeine and she says she doesn't want me to get addicted and all the stuff i'm telling her about my schoolwork is just so i can pop pills and be an addict. i told her all the facts, how i'm less likely to get addicted to other substances on medication, tried to compromise, she is still unwilling. and also the good old everyone has adhd. i had 2gs of caffeine once, heart rate under 90. normal apparently

2025-11-03 19:31:06;Thinking of getting tested for ADHD.;"Hey everyone,
Lately I’ve been wondering if I might have ADHD. I haven’t been diagnosed, but after reading and watching people talk about their experiences, a lot of it feels really familiar.

Some things I’ve noticed about myself:
- I struggle to stay focused on tasks and procrastinate, even on simple chores like cleaning, laundry, and cooking. I’ve always procrastinated with school and uni assignments since middle school. 
- During meetings my mind drifts in and out, and I sometimes realize I’ve missed parts of the conversation.
- I can get hyperfixated on certain topics for hours, but can’t seem to focus on things I “should” do.
- When I want something, I feel like I need it right now — otherwise I lose interest or just end up scrolling on my phone instead.
- I sometimes spend impulsively, especially when I’m stressed or in a low mood. On the flip side, if I have too many options (like when shopping), I get overwhelmed and end up buying nothing.

I know these things could have other causes too, but it’s starting to affect my productivity and daily life. For those of you who’ve been tested, what made you decide to get evaluated?

Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences! ";r/adhdwomen;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1on9b93/thinking_of_getting_tested_for_adhd/
2025-11-03 19:13:53;Is it possible to build discipline and routine without burning out when you’re managing ADHD and motherhood?;"For context - I got diagnosed a 6 months before I fell pregnant, so motherhood/managing postpartum/trying to navigate my new diagnosis and getting my medication to a stable dose was and has been overwhelming if nothing else. I feel like I’m constantly fighting an uphill battle, everytime I find a routine that works I fail, or my daughter reaches a new major milestone that changes the dynamic (recently she’s dropped her daytime nap and I am suffering) 
She is now 3 years old and I want to make sure I’m setting her up for success but can’t even do that for myself 😭 

I always wanted to be a mother, I love my daughter so much, but some days I don’t feel like I’m cut out to be a mum when I’m barely holding it together myself 😓

2025-11-03 18:47:52;Struggling with ADHD meds and work. (Advice needed);"I currently have a job that is very high paced and demanding - 50-60 hour weeks, consistent movement, work coming home with me and adjusting to last minute schedule demands. I was diagnosed 2+ years ago and found Vyvanse works well for me.

The problem comes in that often what my work asks of me can become much harder while being mediated, which sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. I often have to work early mornings (1:45 wake up at the earliest) and sometimes have situations where I have to work through until 8-11pm. Or I have to do split shifts - Start at 4am, go home midday, come back at 5pm. The meds wearing off while still having to *go* feels like being drunk sometimes and I get nervous driving home after that. Also my days off I become essentially useless because I’m too tired to do anything.

I’ve talked to my doctor and she more or less thinks because of how much movement I do in a day that I’m metabolizing the medication faster than it’s supposed to. We spoke about upping the dosage being a possibility but due to this and a few other issues, she’s more supportive of me just leaving this role. I also don’t really want to up my dosage right now because when I do have some consistent time out of work and can sustain healthier habits, I find my current dosage works pretty well for me.

My role has a lot of responsibility and pays really well, which i need to keep my house. I’ve looked into possibly getting accommodations but anything saying I can’t commit to certain requirements of my job will likely be denied. Anyone experience anything like this or have any tips?

I wrote a lot and gave examples for each question. But just can’t shake the fact that I feel like I may or may not have it. Anyone else feel like this at the beginning? Just wish it was more thorough. I had so much to say in the assessment but could feel myself jumping from one thing to another so I was probably annoying the assessor. It’s driving me insane me can’t stop scrolling on Reddit to resonate with someone else and their experiences with having adhd hoping I can answer the questions that are going on in my head.

2025-11-03 17:35:05;Safe space for vent;"hey. I need comfort and a place to vent in a community that might understand me.

I'm currently in a transitional period in my life, I'm unemployed, I failed an important exam last week that I'll be taking again in February, my boyfriend and I might be moving back to our hometown after 10 years...and everything seems overwhelming. 

Sometimes I feel like a failure because I feel like other people are handling everything better, accepting it more easily and are less afraid of change. The worst thing is that it seems like they make decisions more easily. Sometimes I feel helpless and childish because I need more time to process events, plans and emotions. 

Since I'm not working right now and I don't have to start studying for the exam right away since I have time till february when I can take it again(and I don't know how it would work if I found a job and simultaneously prepared for the bar exam, I think that would be too exhausting, and there's no point in looking for a job in a city we're planning to move out of in a few months, maybe), I have time to rest and do nothing, but I feel guilty because the financial part is on my partner right now and I have the impression that I'm useless and a failure sometimes.

If someone I care about was in that situation, I would tell them to take some time off, to rest from that months-long period of great stress of taking and failing the exam, and to slowly start studying for the retake, but it's much harder to remain gentle and gentle with myself and allow myself to just be, do nothing productive, let thoughts just pass and allow all feelings...

So yeah, I needed to vent in a space where people might underdtand my struggles.

2025-11-03 15:45:15;Urgent: Should I consider professional help?;"Hi,

I'm a student in one of my most important years. If I fail this year like the ones before, then I won't know what to do with my life.
My main reason for posting is that I don't want be looking back from the future and be filled with regret that I didn't seek answers when I first saw signs. If this is ADHD or anything I need to get checked out, I need to know now.

Here are some patterns I noticed since a year or more back:
1. I can focus for hours on subjects I like (like biology, the subject everyone else I know despises). But for other subjects I despise I cannot start studying even if I force myself, I retain almost nothing. This led to a significant drop in my grades for the last 3 years.

2. And this isn't just about school. I struggle with basic self-care, like showering. I'll go to the bathroom, turn the water on, and then end up sitting on the floor doing something else for 20 minutes. Even if my parents tell me to do it I still don't and I can only do things if someone stares at me. I've thought about why and I'm still not sure why, and even if i feel grimy and disgusting for not showering mostly I still don't because I don't feel like it.

3. Cramming. I've read about different study methods and I don't know if I'm trying correctly or even trying at all. I'd promise myself to study consistently, a tiny bit every day, and somehow I just stopped doing it and ended up cramming again. And the effort required to start studying is often overwhelming and I end up scrolling every time, I don't even like scrolling. 

4. My brain almost always has song playing in the background. I constantly am bouncing my leg and tapping my fingers. I always seems to be moving? No one else I know really does that.

I have periods where I function well, I think?
I know everyone procrastinates sometimes. So am I just saying ""oh I have ADHD"" because I procrastinate a bit or something? 
I'm scared of making excuses.

so question: 
Based on your experience, does this sound familiar in any way? I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but whether my experience is similar enough and whether I should start seeking professional help.

2025-11-03 13:51:12;Super Sensitive to Meds?;"I'm extremely sensitive to most medication normally, and it's the same with ADHD meds. Just wondering if anyone else had experienced the same? 

I'm 3 months in since my diagnosis (40F). 
Currently on 5mg Dex in the morning, and again in the afternoon. If I have lots to do, I up it to 7.5mg each time (only 15mg a day). When I do that, I really notice my heart-rate.

Even 20mg Vyvanse was too strong for me and made me cloudy and unproductive (I was on it for over a month at 30mg then lowered it to 20mg - all with doctor's advice). Plus I've always had massive issues trying to sleep - this is exactly the same on ADHD meds, I even stay awake with Melatonin. 

I wondered if this means I even have ADHD? But, on almost every single metric, I rated extremely highly - doctor said I was a very textbook case. ADHD honestly *does* explain 100% of my weird quirks and struggles throughout my life.

Sometimes, seemingly without trigger, I experience sudden and extreme feelings of dread. It’s a little hard to explain, as the feeling isn’t typically accompanied by many thoughts, but I guess I could generalize it as a sense of not belonging. For example, I’d be talking to a friend or hanging out with somebody and be having a good time, and suddenly I’d get hit with the most jarring feeling of “I don’t wanna be here” or “I shouldn’t be here”, accompanied by maybe the opposite of nostalgia? Like remembering, but bad things rather than good.

I’ve tried but have been unable to obtain an ADHD diagnosis in the past, though I’m 99% sure I have it (inattentive type). I’m constantly remarked as appearing lost or confused even though i feel as though I’m acting and appear normal. It’s getting really annoying at this point - I’ve heard these comments hundreds of times from so many different people and over the years despite trying my hardest to correct myself, I still get these comments. Although I now get them a lot less compared to when I first started getting them, i still feel like people look at me like I’m a fool. Over the years I’ve become extremely self aware because of comments like these and a range of other issues. I try my best to act confident and mirror people, which makes interacting with others really tiring sometimes as I have to put great effort into thinking through everything I do and say.

2025-11-03 12:08:08;It’s just never enough;"Uhm. Not really actually looking for any responses I just need somewhere to say something I guess I don’t know if that’s the right flair it seemed close enough

I’ve been diagnosed for well over half my life and it kind of feels like no matter how much I try or how much I improve it’s never enough. Everyone is constantly moving the goalpost for everything just as soon as I meet it. And it’s getting genuinely so hard to convince myself to keep trying at all and I feel like if I fall into that mindset it’s going to hurt me horribly in the future.

It’s just. It’s too much man honestly. I’m as functional as im going to get with my adhd. Chores get done before midnight, i eat somewhat consistently, all of my work gets done, i keep myself clean. But everyone always finds a way to tell me im doing it wrong. I know this is something everyone probably deals with but it’s just too much for everything I have to deal with just to do a task. Or to actually have a schedule that works. 

I’m literally fighting the wasps of my mind so I can do laundry but it’s a problem because I don’t fold it as soon as it comes out of the washer. Its a problem because I do classwork during lunch. It’s a problem cause I eat dinner at 9. 

The fact that I can even REMEMBER or convince myself to eat a whole meal at any point in time is great progress considering I used to eat less than once a day sometimes. Most days I even eat three meals now!!! Ive even been told that im doing my emotions “wrong” because when im upset about something instead of leaving the situation to be angry I leave it and cry. Like,,?? I genuinely can’t do anything right I guess???? Sorry??

It’s not even that. I want them to praise me for doing things cause im not a baby I don’t need them to give me a sticker everytime I wash the dishes and stuff

2025-11-03 12:05:17;ADHD and slow eating;"So for all my life I have been a slow eater, often taking upwards of an hour or even longer to finish my food every meal. I'd also say I'm relatively picky, but not to the point where I'm only eating like chicken tenders and fries everywhere. Very often while I was in school I would bring back my lunch only half eaten cause I wouldn't have enough time for me to eat it all. But overall the slow eating has plagued me for a while, and I don't know if I just missed something in my development or what.  

Very recently I got an ADHD diagnosis, and of course along with other factors, this is one of the things that drove me to seek a diagnosis in the first place cause I read there might be some correlation. Even after getting the diagnosis, I still feel kind of lost, especially cause it's only one thing out of many I'm thinking about. I have no idea how I should navigate this now, cause it has especially always caused some fights between me and my parents who get frustrated. Any advice would be appreciated.

2025-11-03 11:28:01;Is this normal ADHD stuff?;"I’m not sure if what’s going on with me is ADHD or anxiety, or maybe just normal brain stuff? Can someone tell me if they also experience any this?

- I (35 F) had a ADHD diagnosis back about 8 years ago but only took meds for a few months because they made my stomach sick feeling and gave me horrible headaches. I was going to try different ones but then I lost my health insurance and the pandemic happened and I’ve just not prioritized it. 

- Basically I am very sensitive to being overstimulated and feel overwhelmed easily. If there are too many noises going on, multiple people talking to me at once it makes me furious. I feel like I walk around mildly pissed off 60% of the time because I have a toddler and a husband who are *always talking*, the dog is barking, music is on and it’s all happening at once.

- On top of this I am having sensory issues and I can feel my hair in my face if it isn’t pulled back, I can feel how my underwear press on my stomach of legs, or my shirt fabric isn’t right, my skin feels dry or my fingertips sticky, basically my body is a distraction often. I find myself preening my hair or applying lotion or washing my hands a lot. If I can’t wash whatever is on my hands it’s a distraction until I can. If I can’t pull my hair back it’s also a huge distraction and I feel pissed off. If there is  a smudge on my glasses I also feel really distracted and disoriented. I can’t stand still, I’m always swaying or rocking slightly or jiggling my foot. I find doodling helps me focus more and be able to sit still.  

- I don’t have time blindness that many ADHD people seem to have . Infact I am always hyper aware of how late I will be if I don’t do this right away or how much I need to hurry. I always feel rushed or like I need to rush.

-  I have a super hard time focusing on things like reading, yet I can’t *stop* focusing on stuff like online shopping or social media, even if I want to stop I find it hard to. For example, spending hours researching something that feels important even if it isn’t, even if I no longer want to spend my time doing that because it feels like an emergency. Example: bought pillow inserts at a yard sale, spent 3 hours trying to pick out new pillow covers online but couldn’t find the right one and wanted to go to sleep but couldn’t pull myself away. 

- I often find myself snacking as a sensory input thing even if I’m not hungry. I want to chew on something and it helps me focus and feel calm. 

- I don’t have much, if any social anxiety. I’m very good at reading people and make friends easily but people often told me I was a little weird growing up.

- If someone gives me directions verbally I don’t catch any of it. I need written directions. I might catch the first 10% then I just can’t hold it in my brain for some reason if I don’t write it down. 

- If a new task comes up while I’m doing something else, I have a hard time not stopping and starting the new thing. If I’m interrupted I will sometimes forget to go back and finish my original task and I hate being interrupted. Writing down what I need to do helps me not forget but getting back “in the zone” of that task can take a long time.  

- Routines are my saving grace and if I get off my routine I feel very anxious. For example we put our laundry away every Sunday and if something prevents that from happening I feel anxious and unable to have a good time until the routine is completed. If I establish a process and follow said process, I appear very organized and on top of stuff so it always surprises people to hear I’m struggle with ADHD because I’m very type “A”. I think I’m overcompensating and that’s causing some of the anxiety but again, not sure. 

Is this ADHD stuff? Should I go get evaluated again because I don’t fit the disorganized time blind ADHD symptoms? ";r/adhdwomen;9;13;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1on1dob/is_this_normal_adhd_stuff/
2025-11-03 11:24:09;Day 2 on Adderall XR. Not sure what to expect.;"Recently got diagnosed and started on Adderall XR 10mg 11/1. The first day on it I felt productive and my mood was better.

I’m just not sure if I should be expecting or noticing some drastic changes or if it still takes time for my body to adjust.

2025-11-03 10:32:27;Bad habit of suddenly ‘getting angry all by myself’ from random flashbacks;"I get mood swings out of nowhere from random small memories hitting me with zero noticeable triggers. It revolves around interactions with people that upset me but I never spoke about at the time. 

It’s happened enough times my fiancé coined the term ‘Did you get angry all by yourself again?’ which is a sweet way to acknowledge & diffuse the situation. 

I never give silent treatment or lash out since that is abusive, but I find it hard to act like everything is okay when my mind is clouded. 


🧠WHAT IT FEELS LIKE: 

I’ll have a ‘quiet’ moment to myself with no music or distractions. I could be showering, walking, staring at the wall and my brain hits me with: 

1️⃣ Remember that off hand comment your fiancé made years ago, completely unrelated to you, but felt slightly uncomfortable?

2️⃣ Let’s replay that with 10x intensity to analyse why you NEED to be super upset RIGHT NOW! 

3️⃣ Let’s also distort everything, make assumptions, and conflate bad traits of all men to paint an inaccurate picture. 

4️⃣ Now you’re secretly upset at him, but don’t bring it up now - it’s completely irrelevant! 
Plus he demonstrates unconditional love daily so you’d look extra horrible to mention it 🤭


🤔WHY IS IT HAPPENING? 

I heard about ‘rumination’ recently but most sources talk about overthinking your own past mistakes. 

I ruminate over small upsetting moments from past interactions out of my control, from months or years ago.

Maybe they’re mistakes in disguise, like staying quiet over broken boundaries and being a people pleaser. 

Or I’m trying to regain control of the past and fix situations by reliving them. Maybe I’m staying alert for future confrontations, or finding reasons to cut people out before I get hurt again. 

I don’t write these issues in a journal since I genuinely don’t want to think about them. But ignoring it causes rumination to happen against my will anyway. 

I wondered if anyone has the same experience? I’ve only been diagnosed with ADHD-C and a specific phobia (emetophobia), not PTSD or anxiety which seem to cause rumination. 


TL;DR - I get upset by random small past moments which hit me with no clear triggers. I ruminate heavily and get upset at people when they’ve done nothing wrong in the present moment. 

If anyone experiences the same thing or has advice, I’d love to hear it!

2025-11-03 10:01:10;Discouraging Med Journey;"Recently started my ADHD diagnosis and treatment journey at 28, and decided, under the advice of my psychiatrist, to try some different intro med options. 

First, we tried Wellbutrin, and my anxiety shot through the roof! Within the first couple of weeks or so, I was having heart palpitations and getting intense tinnitus. So we quickly switched over to Guanfacine (1mg), but I wasn't seeing any changes. So my psych bumped it up to 2mg. It's been two weeks, and while I've seen some improvement in my task initiation, the side effects have been hellish. I keep experiencing bouts of extreme exhaustion and have been getting hypotension and, again, annoying tinnitus. This has been deeply problematic as I have a lot riding on me at work and am also in grad school full-time, so I need to be on most of the day.

So it's back to square one, and I'm honestly feeling defeated. I trust my psychiatrist and was originally excited to try treatment, but I don't want to be trapped in a cycle of trying meds with adverse side effects. Part of me worries nothing will work, and it will all just be a waste of time.

2025-11-03 09:53:30;Can’t relax/perfectionist/control freak?;"I’m not sure if anyone can relate to this. I was diagnosed earlier this year at 27 so I’m kind of new to all this. For context, I also have OCD and autism.

I feel like my ADHD manifests a lot differently than most people. I’m not sure if it’s because my other diagnoses or what, but just curious if anyone can relate. Basically, I feel like I’m hyper obsessive about cleanliness, organization, and getting things done. I never used to be this way growing up and displayed much more of the stereotypical ADHD symptoms. I feel like once I moved out on my own is when things changed, which I guess makes sense because I now have to do all of the adulting. 

It’s basically like I’m constantly thinking about what I have to do. Constantly thinking about when to do chores. If I have the smallest thing on my to do list I’m hyper aware of it and it’s stressing me out. I write everything down in multiple calendars, utilize my notes and reminders app, etc. Having everything written down certainly helps me feel better than I’m not going to forget about anything, but it doesn’t help with the constant stressing and thinking about it. In fact, seeing all of the things I have to do written in multiple places probably makes that worse. I’m constantly trying to make everything perfect. I’ll often get urges to completely redo something about my apartment to make it look better. I’ll get hyper fixated on it until I cave and spend the money to buy something or replace something. This has led to me impulsively spending for sure. Nothing crazy and nothing I can’t afford, but definitely things that most people would probably say are unnecessary. But it’s like my mind gets stuck on it and sends me into a spiral. I also can’t relax if I know something needs done. For example, this weekend I put together a new headboard. My fiance was not home to help me move it into our bedroom. I could have easily waited for him to get home to help me, but instead I literally somehow managed to do it myself by summoning hulk strength or something. I injured myself and put a little dent in the wall in the process which wouldn’t have happened if I could have just waited like an hour for help. But something is wrong with me and I literally can’t!!! Everything feels like life or death. It needs done NOW. I am driving myself into the ground and burning out and in constant fight or flight. When I started Vyvanse this was under control, but it’s been a few months on 30 mg and I guess it’s not working as well. I’ll be calling my psychiatrist to see what she thinks. I’m in therapy as well. 
Every weekend I swear to myself I’m going to relax and then it ends up being 3:00 and I’ve been go, go, go like a wind up car. All I want to do is relax but it’s like I can’t actually do it. I don’t know what’s not clicking or how to fix it. 

I’m not sure if this even makes sense. It’s hard to put my racing thoughts into words. If you read this far, thank you. 🙏🏻 ";r/adhdwomen;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1omzfs9/cant_relaxperfectionistcontrol_freak/

I’m 33F and was just recently diagnosed by a psychologist. I have compensated well enough thus far to be successful but it definitely causes problems that actually seem to be getting worse with age? hence late diagnosis. 

I’m curious to hear opinions or experiences on disclosing to employer since ADHD is technically is a disability under ADA (in US) but I’m not sure it’s worth the conversation. 
What are your thoughts?

2025-11-03 07:39:14;sexual impulsivity;"hi guys!
i’m 26F, just got diagnosed with ADHD a couple of weeks ago. the biggest thing that i experienced was being impulsive and feeling out of control. i’m wondering if anyone else, particularly women, feel like they also have a lot of sex and that it feels “out of control”. 
for backstory, my ex fiance and i broke up back in march after 6 years together. i have had sex with four people since then. i feel disgusting. i think part of it is just wanting connection, but i’ve always had what i’ve considered a high sex drive. i would have loved to do it everyday. in my past relationship, he had a very low sex drive and we’d do it maybe once a month.
has anyone else experienced this? how can i control myself? and how can i learn to love myself again? 
of note, i don’t have a psychiatrist appt until nov 21 so i am not on any meds for ADHD right now. please help, i feel worthless. ";r/ADHD;58;53;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1omwj14/sexual_impulsivity/

Does anyone find themself “comfortable” in uncomfortable positions?

I also do the same with my hands, like squeezing my fingers a lot. 
Nothing to cause actual pain but it’s not particularly “comfortable”, but you don’t know any other way of getting comfortable. What is this?

The results of this assessment are pretty frustrating and feel invalidating. Maybe I have anxiety and depression because of 30+ years of undiagnosed ADHD. Ugh! Not sure what to do with these results but it feels like the assessment was a waste of time. 

*The patient's responses on testing noted that they currently experiencing symptoms that include inattention, executive dysfunction, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Altogether, this reporting is consistent with the DSM-V diagnostic criteria A for ADHD, and their history of problems as reported by their collateral source of information indicated that their history of symptoms may be consistent the DSM-V diagnostic criteria B for ADHD.
 
The patient reported that their symptoms are present in two or more different settings, which is consistent with the DSM-V diagnostic criteria C for ADHD. In regards to criteria D, the patient's responses on testing instruments and during the clinical interview suggest that their symptoms are  interfering with the quality of her functioning.
 
Finally, in regards to criterion E, given her problems with anxiety and depression. It is unclear if these concerns do not predate the onset of ADHD -type symptoms. Overall, at the moment there is insufficient data to that her reporting is consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, which notes that the patient's concerns cannot be better explained by another mental disorder in order to meet the ADHD diagnostic criteria, due to the severity of the concerns with anxiety and depression*

2025-11-03 06:04:32;Second time trying to post (Need advice);"Hello, this might not make sense as I'm typing this out but I really need answers. 

I am a 19yo female in university living with stereotypical hyper-religious immigrant parents who don't believe in mental illness. When I was in high school they told me a story about how when they sent me to a Christian private school I would get in trouble a lot and every day my dad would punish me because I was so unruly. The school sent them a letter suggesting that I may need a psych eval from a doctor because they thought that I might have had ADHD, and my parents got really angry and threw the letter in the trash and pulled me out of that school. Since then I made way better grades (mostly because it was beaten into me by them) but it only lasted so long as now I live on campus and struggle with the workload here. My freshman year went horrible as I tried to adjust but it was so much at once and tbh I never really learned how to study effectively. I barely scraped by with a 2.3 GPA and I got really upset at myself but I know part of the reason is that I'm undiagnosed and my ability to mask is falling apart. 

I tried to visit my on-campus counseling center but they have limited sessions and my insurance (Kaiser) I learned isn't accepted almost anywhere, and I feel even more hopeless now. My boyfriend has told me again and again that I need an evaluation from a psychiatrist but the issue with paying out-of-pocket for it is bugging me and there's only so much i can do with more schoolwork piling on me. I feel so demotivated and burnt out. I'm not asking for any medical advice but how do I get an evaluation that won't break the bank? Has anyone ever experience getting diagnosed this late?

2025-11-03 04:50:00;Is it difficult for neurodivergent women to socialize?;"I guess this is more so a rant because I want to feel like being unlikable is due to the way I’m socializing. Recently, I was diagnosed with ADHD f25. I wouldn’t say I’m unlikable by most people but more so unapproachable? I’m new at my a coffee shop job and am highly struggling with connecting with coworkers. The good side is that I’ve been able to make one friend. The downside is no one ever really tells me they like me and some don’t greet me nor say bye. Pretty much most of the coworkers greet and say bye to the others. I attempt conversations by asking people about themselves but they never really ask me anything about myself. I remember things about others and I care about others. I’m trying really hard not to play victim but at the end of the day I can’t help but compare myself to the other new people who came two weeks ago-2 months before me and it’s seems like I’ll never be liked as they are constantly greeted and getting asked questions by other coworkers. I’ve been trying really hard not to spiral but I can’t help myself and end up coming home half of the time crying. I’m a quick learner. And therefore assuming I’m a great worker. At least I think I am as I’m being scheduled more and more hours and my boss emphasis how much others “like me” and how much she appreciates having me there.

For context I have been told by others in the past that I’m weird. But what can I do about it? I’m assuming it may have to do with looks and a mix of “weird” personality traits. I also have a difficult time going back and forth in conversations. I have a lot of ideas and topics but it’s difficult putting them into words. Maybe it could also be because I don’t know a lot about modern day culture. I don’t have “social media” ( Reddit still counts though). I don’t watch much tv or if anything, nothing at all most of the time. I listen to music from older generations. 

Like I’ve mentioned I’m trying not to let it get to me as I understand I can’t control people’s actions. But it’s taking a toll on my mental health to the point of becoming depressed.";r/adhdwomen;21;18;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1omshgc/is_it_difficult_for_neurodivergent_women_to/

2025-11-03 03:24:26;Insurance time! I got Cigna earlier this year, then found out they won't pay for Vyvanse/generic until I fail off several other drugs. Looking to avoid a repeat in 2026 - what insurance is worry free?;"I moved to the US 11 years ago, and it still blows my mind what a racket the insurance market is in this country.

Came off my ex-wife's insurance in march and went to the marketplace as I run my own business. $750 a month for Cigna, marketplace said they would cover my Vyvanse. 

First fill they refuse until I fail off three others:

> Documentation of failure, contraindication, or intolerance to THREE of the following [does NOT apply to a diagnosis of binge-eating disorder]:

> 1. dexmethylphenidate ER capsules (generic for Focalin XR) 
> 2. dextroamphetamine/amphetamine ER capsules (generic for Adderall XR) 
> 3. dextroamphetamine ER capsules (generic for Dexedrine)
> 4. methylphenidate ER capsules (generics for Metadate CD or Ritalin LA) OR methylphenidate ER tablets (generic for Concerta) 

I already failed off adderall in 2015 and ritalin in 2021, been on Vyvanse with no issues for 4 years. My doc had a meeting with them and argued the point, but they refused. 

I can't afford weeks to months of likely unproductivity while I test out focalin/dexedrine (especially when my doctor insists on starting on the lowest available dose and titrating one month at a time), so I paid $250 a month out of pocket for generic Vyvanse all year.

I would like to avoid this if at all possible in the coming year.

I also acknowledge that things can suddenly change (eg the person in CA who suddenly got told to switch to Azstarys by BCBS), but can anyone give me a heads up on others to avoid, and/or what insurance they are reasonably confident will pay for my goddam drugs after I already pay them $750 to $1500 a month just to have coverage?

2025-11-03 02:48:01;Transitions 🥴😵‍💫;"I (27F) was diagnosed with ADHD this year and started meds a couple months ago. I’m currently on 30mg Vyvance. 

Something I realized I struggle SO much with now and when I was growing up is transitions, specifically getting out of the car, getting ready for bed, getting up and out of the house in the morning, getting into the shower… etc. I always felt like I was just lazy and couldn’t get myself motivated enough to do whatever it was I needed to do. Even if it was a super simple task, it would take me so long to actually start it.

I started my meds and the first thing I noticed was how easy it was to get out of the car to go to the grocery store 😂😭 I was in the grocery store for like 5 minutes because I only needed a couple things. I would usually meander and look at things I don’t need.

Today is my day off meds and I got out of the shower and have been laying in my robe with my hair up in a towel for like an hour. I have things I need to do and I cannot get myself up 😂 It’s really wild how much you notice once you’ve been diagnosed and have reflected on your life lmao";r/adhdwomen;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ompd2v/transitions/
2025-11-03 02:31:40;Interplay between anxiety & ADHD;"In the “what don’t you struggle with” thread, a lot of people cited anxiety as a reason they don’t struggle with something (lateness, clutter, disorganization, etc). I’ve noticed that, for me, there is a lot of interplay between anxiety and ADHD, and was wondering what other people’s experiences are.

Like a lot people, my doc wanted to address possible depression/anxiety while treating my ADHD. One med I was put on worked too well. I was too laid back. I told my doc, this med is killing me. I *need* some level of anxiety to overcome my ADHD symptoms. For me, and my level of anxiety (mild/moderate) and my level of ADHD (*very* severe), no anxiety is worse for me than anxiety.

My anxiety about money prevents most impulsive purchases. Without the anxiety of a looming deadline, that deadline would fly right by. Anxiety over an upcoming houseguest gives me that extra fire to clean and organize. My anxiety over leaving my children parentless reduces the risky/dangerous behaviors that are still so enticing to me.

Then there are times when I have the kind of anxiety that renders me absolutely unable to function just as a deadline is approaching which I’ve know about for so long but have procrastinated. You can’t win them all.

Conversely, when I am having heightened anxiety, I feel like my ADHD (inattentive type) helps me deal with it sometimes. Like, this is not a life-or-death situation. No decision needs to be made now. No biggie, we’ll just try again later, we don’t have to do anything now. Tomorrow is another day. And so on.

I don’t have severe anxiety. I do have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder diagnosis. I could do without the occasional episode of acute, crippling anxiety (some/many/all of these episodes could actually be panic attacks, I haven’t sussed it out yet), but overall, my daily undercurrent of anxiety is something I’ve come to rely on to function. Especially since I’m already 49, so I’ve been relying on it for a long time already. 

(I don’t want to diminish those with severe anxiety by proposing that it’s actually a good thing, rather than the debilitating condition it is for so many. Sometimes there isn’t a silver-lining, and I don’t want to imply that there is.)";r/adhdwomen;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1omoxu5/interplay_between_anxiety_adhd/
2025-11-03 01:10:39;Doctor said I don’t have ADHD and prescribed anxiety meds;"So after researching and considering a tonne I finally decided to consult a psychiatrist, hoping to get screened for adhd.

I’m(22F) currently preparing for a major exam and I’ve had this whole year to prepare but I’ve barely made any progress, I’ve been free all day everyday doing random things (think reading mangas, clash royale, random fixations, thinking about outfits etc). My only goal through this consultation was to figure out if I have adhd or if it’s something else. Every time I study I get distracted by random things and don’t achieve any of my daily study goals, I think I’ve mentally given up on myself, I haven’t studied a word since last month. 

This problem also extends to regular chores, folding laundry somehow ends up taking half a day, cleaning my room is almost impossible, I get so frustrated, it takes days, unpacking after a trip takes weeks, doing laundry is an extremely difficult chore as well. 

Focusing on classes is also impossible. Like I literally cannot listen to an hour long lecture without feeling like my soul is being sucked out of my body. As a child I remember being unable to sleep cos my head got so loud and runny and the non-stop thoughts, things that didn’t make sense, so random and nonsensical, that I would get up in the middle of the night and play dress up for hours. I still do random stuff when my head gets like that. Watching movies is boring, I can only watch kids cartoons, I thought my attention span got fucked due to watching reels and shorts, so I cut all access to short form media. Sometimes I have the urge to run away from classes, not because I’m anxious but because I’m sooo bored I’d rather run than sit there, I used to run during school lunch breaks cos I’d get so bored and frustrated after sitting for so long, I needed some kind of release, I’m also really fidgety when I try to focus, sitting still when trying to focus or when I’m bored is really difficult, but I’ve read that it’s also a symptom of anxiety. So I can’t be sure.

Ok with all these problems I went to the doctor, she literally told me ADHD can only be diagnosed before 12. I asked her what about undiagnosed adults she said it’s difficult to diagnose so she only treats the symptoms. 
Honestly I’m not even sure if I communicated properly, cos the first thing she did after I entered was *yawn*, and when I told her that I really need to prepare for this exam and achieve the goals I set for myself she was like I need to appreciate myself because even getting an engineering degree is an achievement, or that being kind to others is also an achievement, so I shouldn’t put myself down and my expectations and goals for myself are extremely high (they really aren’t). She kept insisting that I just have anxiety and prescribed bupropion, I couldn’t even explain my other problems because she didn’t ask me anything, and expected me to explain my problem. So all I could emphasise was my difficulty in preparing for an exam cos I blanked out on everything else. She literally wrote 2 words in my diagnosis, overthinking and FRUSTRATED (in all caps lol). 

I’m pretty sure I also have performance anxiety, I have mental breakdowns and all, but most of the time I’m chill, sometimes I find it difficult to talk to people in social settings but that’s because I find small talk very difficult… and boring, and trying too hard gives me migraines. Also the general frustration with myself gives me headaches sometimes.
She has asked me to book an appointment after 2 weeks to check if the medicine is working, I plan to take the meds because what if it’s actually anxiety? I do tend to overthink a lot. But this whole situation has made me so confused and frustrated, I’m getting a headache thinking about it. 
How would you distinguish between anxiety and ADHD, since so many of the symptoms overlap. 

For context, I’m 22F, living in the Middle East but originally from India, there’s barely any info about mental health help online for the country I’m residing in, and it’s hard to find a psychiatrist, the one I consulted at least mentioned ADHD in children in her profile, do you think I should try doing online consultation with a doctor from India? 

TL;DR:
I (22F) went to a psychiatrist hoping to get evaluated for ADHD after years of struggling with focus, procrastination, and executive dysfunction. The doctor dismissed it, said ADHD can only be diagnosed before 12, and prescribed bupropion for “anxiety.” I’m taking the meds just in case, but I’m confused — how do you tell ADHD and anxiety apart when symptoms overlap? Should I try consulting a psychiatrist online instead?

Sorry for the long post, I was just really frustrated.

2025-11-03 00:53:52;Times and dates, the eternal struggle;"I received my diagnosis (AuDHD) two days ago. I never considered having ADHD because I did very well in school and never needed to finish assignments in the last minute. I studied constantly at university instead of starting a few weeks before the exam phase.

The only thing that seemed strange to my was my terrible relationship to times and dates. I tried basically everything. Calendar apps, post its, a physical calender on the fridge. Today it happened again: I was dead sure I had an appointment on November 13th but it is *tomorrow.* Result: I won't be well-prepared and I had to cancel a dinner with a friend I was looking forward to.

It slowly sinks in that this will be forever. No matter how hard I try I will always forget or misremember times and dates. And our whole society is based on remembering these correctly. Pretty devestating.";r/ADHD;3;4;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ommf1q/times_and_dates_the_eternal_struggle/
2025-11-03 00:50:02;Looking for tips on RTW in healthcare as someone newly diagnosed with ADHD;"Hi all, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing severe burnout and going on stress leave. I am now on medication and continuing with therapy, but my therapist does not have ADHD specific experience. I am still waiting on an appointment with the OT in my doctors office to assist with additional symptom management. I will be returning to work gradually starting in a few weeks and am looking for any tips to help ensure that I am successful.

I work in healthcare as a registered nurse in a clinic and am concerned about; time management; time blindness; emotional dysregulation; stress management.

I feel like historically I have always been a very good nurse, but at the expense of my own mental health. I put pressures on myself to make sure I do everything right and perfectly. It definitely takes me longer to complete tasks than my peers as I often go back and triple check everything, and have a harder time switching tasks and remembering to go back to things since we are constantly interrupted. I cant really avoid interruptions, so I'm wondering if anyone has any tips to help? I am also concerned about multitasking; we are expected to monitor our phone calls while in clinic and I have always struggled with checking my calls when I'm so busy.

Previously I would generally skip breaks because I would under estimate how much time it takes to complete a task or I would over commit instead of passing tasks off to coworkers, and would always stay late with unpaid over time to make sure I got all my charting done.

I will definitely work with the OT on these things once I get an appointment, but thought I might get some helpful tips here while I wait :)

2025-11-03 00:12:16;Why Do I Always Feel Left Out?;"So the title is pretty self-explanatory. I’ve been diagnosed with ADD since I was ten, and I’m 23 now for context. 

From as far back as I can remember, I have always felt different than my peers. I had a pretty decent social life in elementary school and even had some pretty strong friendships, but moving schools after 5th grade in a time period where kids at that age still didn’t have cellphones caused me to lose touch with a lot of them. Enter in middle school where I was bullied and teased for all three years and I was pretty much isolated with the exception of about 2 genuine friendships.

High school wasn’t much different, except I didn’t get bullied there (thankfully). But I did struggle to find my people and I was in two different friend groups that didn’t end up lasting after graduation.

College… you guessed it. I graduated with about 2 close friendships that I still hold dear to me to this day.

It just makes me feel so lonely and weird when I go on social media and see people from elementary school, middle school, high school, and college all hanging out with each other. They all have friends and friend groups that they post all of the time whereas I just go to work, go to school (I’m a grad student at a really, REALLY small college), and hang out with my boyfriend and family. I don’t live close to either of my close friends (one is out of state and the other is a couple of hours away and I don’t have a car).

2025-11-02 23:52:48;Meds let me FINISH a task;"I started on Vyvanse in early July when life was completely falling apart.  I was diagnosed as a child and was medicated through late college and then decided to go without them for the next 18-ish years, which was a terrible, terrible choice, but there we are.  Vyvanse has not a tears-inducing life changer, but they have been massively helpful in a lot of ways, some big and noticeable and others small and in the background, but the most helpful has been the ability to finish a task.

For example, I had a conference proposal due two weeks ago, and it was due at 11:59pm on Sunday night Eastern.  I calmly submitted it Saturday morning.  I have a job application due tonight at 11:59, but I submitted it yesterday afternoon after getting back from a week-long trip with my family.  Now, did I spend way too much time on both of these?  Absolutely!  I care about them, and for me caring is the sworn enemy of productivity.  Did I let hyperfocusing on them take over a lot of other things that I also needed be doing?  For sure.  Again, meds haven't been a miracle cure.  But before I would have had to worked myself into a panic to turn something in.  I would be up for 48 hours straight, and I wouldn't eat, and I'd have called in 'sick' to whatever meetings/appointments/plans I'd have had on the calendar because I needed to work on this, and I'd be frantically saving my files at 11:54 only to see that they were the wrong file type and I'd be sweating and crying and promising myself that I'd never do this ever again even though I've been doing exactly this for the last 20 years.  But somehow, in a way I don't understand, meds allow me to just be done and turn it in.  It's such a strange feeling that it actually makes me nervous.  Maybe I'm getting dumber and I don't see how bad my work is?  Am I such a failure that just turning it in is all I expect from myself now?  Do I not care anymore and that's why I can submit it and walk away?  But even if all of these things are true, it's such an incredible feeling to not put myself through all of that and I'm so grateful.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I'd love to hear your thoughts, because I'm both thrilled and anxious at the same time!";r/adhdwomen;25;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1omktve/meds_let_me_finish_a_task/

Last night a friend told me that he doesn't believe I want to get better. It wasn't condemning or accusatory, more of an observation, but it made me think that maybe he's right and I don't? I've tried so many times to go to therapy or try yet another scheduling app or start going to the gym but I always give up and quit. I refuse to try medication after trying one and having a terrible experience and now I'm scared to try any more, even if they have the possibility of helping. I always quit therapy after a few months because I don't see results quickly enough. What if I don't actually want to get better? I thought I did but clearly I'm not actually trying. I was blaming the adhd but now I'm starting to wonder if I'm just using that as an excuse to avoid doing any actual work.

I’ve been reading a bit about hyperfixation and I’m not totally sure if I’m using the term right, so sorry if I’m not! I just noticed that a lot of people with ADHD talk about experiencing it.

For me, it’s like I get super into one topic for a while, like a month or so, and it becomes all I want to think or talk about. Then out of nowhere, I just stop caring about it completely. And when that happens, it feels like this huge empty void, like I don’t know what to do with myself. I try to distract myself with other things, but that usually just makes me feel worse.

I’ve gone through so many of these hyperfixations, and sometimes they come back, but even when I try to get back into them, it doesn’t feel the same anymore. It just feels off.

I guess I just wanted to ask if anyone’s been through something like this and how you deal with it? It honestly doesn’t feel great, and I’m kind of scared to talk about it with my friends because I don’t want to weird them out.

2025-11-02 22:26:57;How to contol social anxiety with ADHD;"Hi, I'm 24f, I recently started back in college to do my master's, and it was only earlier this year that I was diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD. Over the summer, when medicated and not in college, I noticed a huge improvement in less anxiety. But now that I'm in this academic setting again, I have a huge amount of paralysis and feelings of shame and embarrassment that seem to be causing this spike in social anxiety. I have no idea how to manage these feelings or if it's something that will naturally improve over time because of exposure? It probably doesn't help that my lectures in college are more like group discussions than talks. I know I have things to say, but I just can't bring myself to actually speak out loud, and it kind of reinforces the shame. Then, when I did speak in one class, I noticed how disjointed and disruptive it was. I know no one goes from my course goes home and thinks about these things, but I just don't know how to get out of this rut. Any tips or things that have worked for you would be amazing, thank you!!

2025-11-02 22:16:48;How do you get out of the anxiety vs. ADHD spiral with the Dr?;"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but have none of the paperwork to prove it. No clue who the offices or Drs were that did it. I can’t afford to get retested and have never had a psychologist nor psychiatrist relationship until now. I recently had a baby and was being seen to help with just generally adjusting to postpartum. I had talked to my therapist about how hard it was to get stuff done and she kept telling me she thinks it’s postpartum anxiety (which I had been told my whole life by every GP) and referred me to a psychiatrist. 

Anyway, I 100% had PPA and meds are incredible and my life IS a night and day difference now. BUT!!! I still have ADHD but I can’t seem to get anywhere with it. The solution is trying different task management styles and upping the anxiety meds. The psychiatrist even put ADHD into my file, so it’s now newly documented!!

I just don’t know how to get her to entertain the idea of some sort of meds for ADHD but I don’t want to seem like I’m med seeking. I know know my anxiety meds improved my quality of life greatly and I know it can be *better*

I’m diagnosed with autism and ADHD. So I was thinking maybe I’m tired or overstimulated from actually functioning this week??? Idk does anyone recognize this?  Also on antidepressants and anti psychotics btw. 

Also feeling guilty bc of my meds. I feel like I’m cheating life. I get less anxious on them, I can think more clearly and am actually able to put things into perspective. I have a normal day night rhythm, I actually wake up on time and am able to do things. But all this doesn’t feel like the things the meds are supposed to do??

2025-11-02 19:06:20;Minimal effects from medication?;"I was diagnosed just after my 38th birthday earlier this year

Initially I was prescribed Intuniv MR 1mg (Guanfacine), and it was amazing! I was productive and happy. My head was quiet and clear for the first time ever. A few days later though, I had a bad depressive episode, but thankfully it only lasted a day

A few more days of feeling on top of the world, and then I was hit again with a low - depression, crying, helplessness, and suicidal ideation

The next day I was back to normal, and continued amazingly. But then - another episode, but this time the suicidal thoughts were combined with such a strong urge to follow through. I was so terrified, I ended up driving myself to hospital - but couldn't get the strength to walk in. Instead I just sat in the carpark bawling for about 2 hours before driving back

The following morning, I made an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist and saw her that afternoon. I was a bit better by this stage, but still very unsettled

I explained what had happened throughout the month, and that the incredible highs followed by increasingly bad lows had me extremely worried about a bipolar disorder or that the next time I may not be so lucky or strong enough to resist the urges

She accused me of faking, saying the medication I was on doesn't cause those symptoms, and that I was there for ""stronger"" meds. I was gutted, and started crying again - begging if there was anything she could do to help, or if I should just go off of the medication altogether and continue living my life like I used to pre-diagnosis

After much huffing and lectures, she prescribed me Aspen Dexamfetamine 15mg, and shooed me out of her office

I've been on the dexies for a few months now, and overall my mental health has gone back to being more stable.. but I miss the happiness and productivity that seemed to come with the other meds

It's frustrating and sad(?) to see how dexies affect others, and yet for me, it barely quietens my brain, let alone anything else..

Has anyone else had experiences like with - both Intuniv (Guanfacine) and the reactions, and with Dexamphetamine not ""doing much""?

Thank you in advance

I’m currently undergoing an ADHD assessment and awaiting a result. I am almost certain I have severe inattentive adhd and find day to day life extremely difficult. 

My parents are not reliable narrators of my childhood, so I’m fishing around for the evidence myself. 

From memory, my signs were:

Explosively messy bedroom that I could never kept tidy. My mom actually kicked me out for being so messy, but that’s another story 

Doodling incessantly at school - my notebooks are covered and I was often told off for this 

Constantly late to school, and detentions for that reason

Zoning out constantly. People around me would have to say my name multiple times to get my attention 

Skipping school just because. My reports said my academic record was “marred by my absence”

Bullied, only a few friends. I found friendships hard to maintain and kids thought I was weird and quiet

2025-11-02 17:56:21;Parents denied every ADHD symptom on my childhood assessment form;"This is mostly a rant about my (35F) parents (mid-60s) and how they’ve handled my ADHD assessment process.

I was recently assessed and the psychiatrist said I show many symptoms consistent with ADHD, mainly inattentive type with some impulsivity. As part of the process, my husband (for adulthood) and my parents (for childhood) were asked to fill out questionnaires about what they’ve noticed.

My husband did the form and also spoke with the doc and gave a lot strong and detailed examples. But my parents have denied every single symptom on all 19 pages and said they did this because school never said I had any problems. They even said they found a report card that said my conduct was excellent to which I tried to explain conduct means behaviour and I have never had an issue with misbehaving. I’ve had issues with how I learn and process things etc.

They didn’t even tick things like messy bedroom (still blatantly true now unless I’m having guests) or didn’t read books (I’ve never finished a book from front to back in my life). It feels selfish and dismissive and like they care more about protecting their image than supporting me.

I can imagine it must be hard as parents to feel like you might’ve missed something in your kid but I’ve never once said that having ADHD reflects badly on their parenting. I just want to get help and understand myself better after years of struggling (and paying quite a bit for the assessment!). But instead of being supportive, they seem determined to deny it out of ego.

When I asked my mum about it (she 100% has ADHD herself), she even admitted over text that she knows I had a messy room and never read but still marked “no” on the form and said I didn’t read because I didn’t have time which is ridiculous as up until now she’s always said she wished I would read. I literally went into my high school exams having not fully read the required book because I didn’t have the motivation and don’t retain anything on a page. 

I’m dreading my next appointment because the psychiatrist will also have to talk to my parents, and I can already imagine how that’ll go. The doctor told me not to worry too much about their answers, but I still feel embarrassed — like she might think I’m exaggerating or lying about my symptoms. Hopefully she sees that my parents are just in denial. I stupidly didn’t go into much detail on what my parents are like as I don’t feel traumatised by them but it is true they have definitely shaped who I am and continue to do so.

Anyway this is mostly a vent but I’d love to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar with their parents during diagnosis. It’s so disappointing when you finally try to get help and your own family refuses to back you.


Edit: just making an edit to note unfortunately I am unable to get my brother to do the form instead as our relationship is essentially non-existent outside of Christmas Day as he’s had a troubled life and it’s just not his personality to do this for me. He would also definitely not answer a phone call from the doctor haha.

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your heartfelt responses. It seems a lot of you have also had similar issues with their parents. Thankfully largely most of your diagnoses weren’t significantly impacted by their parents involvement and some of you were fortunate enough to not even have to involve them at all which is great! It is crazy that we have had to involve the same people that missed the disorder growing up. I’m going to offer to show my psych my mum’s messages and have also had a friend offer to be involved if that’s helpful and I’ll explain the situation with my brother (and his likely hyperactive-impulsive ADHD) and why I don’t want to ask him to do the form. My husband is going to come to my next appointment as well to back me and explain what my family is like. I think I might also just offer to self-report and fill out the form myself to compare against my parents.";r/adhdwomen;422;194;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1omdfey/parents_denied_every_adhd_symptom_on_my_childhood/

I used to buy dex off a friend before I was diagnosed, I took 10mg in the morning, 5-10mg midday/afternoon and sometimes 5mg later on. I always felt the dex kick in and always came home with energy.

Since starting vyvanse, I’ve noticed improved focus but it doesn’t last long at all - which is why I was prescribed dex as I have a toddler and the crash from vyvanse wrecked the evenings. Even if I take 2 x 5mg dex at 5-6pm, it doesn’t feel like it’s working, I can do dinner but don’t feel overly focused and I am tired within an hour or two.

I’ve read some people take a break and then the meds just don’t seem to work? Does anyone know why and how I can fix it?

On the other hand, since adhd can be genetic, i think my dad might have it too. 
Sometimes he thinks out loud. Sometimes he just be sitting by himself staring into space. But since last year he started to show signs of losing sanity. He hallucinates (he thinks my mom and my sister are trying to harm him, my brother and i with dark magic). It doesn’t happen all the time. I can have a 100% rational conversation with him. But when I’m trying to understand him about his hallucinations it doesn’t make sense at all. 

Last night he called my sister at 2am begging her to spare my brother. 

I know y’all might think it has nothing to do with adhd but my dad is in his 60s and he never had adhd assessment or medication (he doesn’t believe in those kind of mental illness) so i think it might be a result of his constant overthinking. 

My grandfather, before passing away, also had similar kind of insanity but it happened really late. 

It’s really making my life a hell.

Its been a LIFE SAVER. Its like forbidden fruit, its so good but it's SOOO BAD! I don't know how to stop it. I hate that I have to rely on AI to assist me in articulating myself. I hate that it's destroying our environment. I've been reading books to help with my vocabulary but, that takes time, as well as therapy to process what I was trying to say vs what I actually said. Does anyone else use AI to help with their adhd? Not with just communicating but, organizing? Planning? Etc. Im dying inside using AI but, it's so helpful. I get like this bitter feeling using it but, I also know that I'm going to be able to get my point across and that feels good. Feels like im stuck between a rock and a hard place. 🫠;r/adhdwomen;0;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1om8vip/ai_helps_and_i_hate_it/
2025-11-02 12:54:35;Severe adhd but I’m an addict.;So yes. I’m seeking empathy. I have had untreated adhd for 12 years (been diagnosed for 18, for whatever  reason once I turned 18 meds stopped being so easy to obtain, before I was an addict). I finally got medication AFTER becoming an addict, and I took my entire script in 7 days. Instead of what I expected to feel, I felt extremely disassociated and slow. But it felt normal. I just wanna feel normal all the time. It’s fucking with my entire life, this disorder. Makes me a good worker at my job, but at the expense of me feeling extremely anxious constantly, because I need to be perfect. And time efficient. Pls help. Are there natural remedies??? This sucks.

2025-11-02 12:50:53;Meds not working;"I've started smoking since starting ritalin. Of course there were stressers in my life at the time but there have always been stressers but I've never felt SO compelled to start smoking. My doc doesn't seem too well versed with adhd and the meds. 

Whenever I bring up any side effects he says that's something else I'm doing and not the meds. But when I google it or look at the pamplet the side effects I've mentioned are right there. 

I'm thinking of stopping my meds completely in the hope that I'll stop smoking. But one of the main reasons I started on the meds was because every therapist I've gone to says I'm dealing with lack of dopamine by binge eating and to make me get off my bed and do work. The meds used to stop me from binge eating. They no longer do that. 

I used to work out regularly before.  But I haven't in a year (taking meds for a year). The only thing I do well right now is meal prep. But I'm still consuming sugar and salty foods like no one's business for like two months. 

It doesn't help that I live with family. Not alone. I also work from home and I'm a freelancer in between projects and the financial worry is also causing me to binge eat. 

In what way does the medication help you? For me it gives me motivation to only do physical things. (Clean. Do laundry. Meal prep. Chores. Etc.). My therapy is crazy expensive and while the meds aren't I can't spend money again to get diagnosed by a new psychologist/psychiatrist. It's mad expensive where I live and like I said in currently out of work and I cannot keep spending crap that doesn't work for me. 

I have tried Strattera. It made me extremely drowsy. My doc says that isn't possible but the side effects have this listed as one of them so I'm confused. I tried another doc in the middle and he gave me like 5 different meds and I just didn't want to do that so I went back to the previous one.

2025-11-02 11:45:05;My mom refuses to let me get ADHD meds;"I’m sorry if this is rambly I’ve been crying for an hour and have never felt more hopeless. I was diagnosed with adhd when I was little, and when I took Adderall in high school, it actually helped me focus and stay motivated. But I lost too much weight and became irritable when i didnt take it, which made my mom panic. She believes Adderall is a gateway drug and refused to let me stay on it, even though the agitation wasnt withdrawal and a pretty common side effect

It became very hard for me to function without it again and i cant properly cope. My mom thinks my ADHD isn’t serious because I get good grades, but that’s only because she yells and guilt-trips me whenever I miss assignments and i would cheat a lot to get homework done just to avoid her being angry  and i'm sorry idk if im allowed to say this on here ive struggled with depression and self harm for years and school has always been my biggest source for this.

Now that I’m in college, I feel like giving up completely. I already dropped one class and my mom made me feel like a failure fucking loser. but things just keep piling up and I know things will only get harder, and without medication, I don’t see how I’ll succeed. I feel so backed into a corner.

I’m 18 now so I i know i could technically get medication on my own, but I don’t have a car or a way to keep it hidden. She regularly goes through my things and has said she’d kick me out if I broke her rules but she’s also threatened to kick me out if I “don’t do something” with my life. I’ve tried explaining that I need help, but she won’t listen.

2025-11-02 09:27:55;Pharmacy Advice Needed;"Hello all, 

I was diagnosed with ADHD, inattentive type earlier this week at 31 and I'm still processing all of those feelings - there's a lot to unpack. Now knowing there might be a way to get relief from the years of internal struggle and feeling so stuck, I am eager to try stimulant medication. I am curious how difficult it is to get your prescription from the pharmacies generally. I have lurked for a minute here and have seen several horror stories of experiences people have had and it sounds painful. Can you please help me prepare for what I'm getting into? 

- How far ahead of time do you need to get it refilled? 
- Are there certain medications that are more difficult to get due to the shortages? 
- Is there anything you wish you would have known before starting medication? ";r/adhdwomen;3;4;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1om4uey/pharmacy_advice_needed/
2025-11-02 09:17:38;I feel super lost in life and everyone says it’s ok;"Hi. This might be messy and all over the place since is my second post on here. I was recently diagnosed a week ago (long time coming 😭) but I need to get this off my chest. 

I feel like I’m at rock bottom. I mean I just turned 25, I don’t have a job, I dropped out of nursing school 2 years ago because I couldn’t keep up with turning in the work which in turn lead me to developing severe depression and thinking nursing wasn’t for me. I went to 3 therapists asking what was wrong with me and no one seemed to have ever caught it. It was only recently when I looked back at my life and realized oh it’s probably adhd. 

It took me so long to even get into nursing school because even basic college classes I was having a hard time getting my work done. I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel like I want to scream at any given moment. I have some ideas but I never act on them or if I try they don’t work out so I feel like they’re not for me. Like after I dropped out I pursued working in the entertainment industry because that’s what I’ve always wanted to do but rejection after rejection just made me give up this year.  

Everyone around me says it’s ok to be lost at my age and that it’s normal to not know what you want to do. And like I guess yeah I know not everyone needs to have everything figured out but I don’t want to struggle anymore because it’s felt like I’ve been struggling my whole life. I don’t know what to do. Everything feels overwhelming. I know that I’m smart and capable but I feel so stuck. 

I just want to be normal for once :( 

Sorry this is so long and rambley. I don’t know if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation before but some advice would be very helpful. ";r/adhdwomen;12;11;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1om4mxj/i_feel_super_lost_in_life_and_everyone_says_its_ok/
2025-11-02 08:20:44;Online journal recommendations?;"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting so please be patient with me 😅 

I *finally* got diagnosed with ADHD-C this past week (Wednesday 10/29 to be exact) and the amount of absolute relief I felt was so validating that I cried happy tears for the first time in a while. Knowing that it's not just my anxiety disorder making me feel the way I do, makes me feel less crazy inside. I have a question, but it comes with an explanation. 

I really have to stop using social media as a diary/journal. I will start typing something to post (usually twitter or bluesky) & realize that maybe I shouldn't be doing that and I'll just end up keeping it in the drafts. My therapist has suggested journaling, but it's genuinely so hard for me to write at the speed that my thoughts are coming out (thanks ADHD brain). I'm a much faster typist. And the thing is, I know that I always feel better after getting things out, even if it's not actually talking to someone. I'm mentally struggling big time this weekend since I'm home alone & that just puts so much more self-imposed mental responsibility on myself. My new psychiatrist prescribed me the generic version of Vyvanse which I'm like ""hell yeah, let's get this show on the road!"" I did go to the pharmacy almost immediately after my psychiatrist appointment because I wanted to start things *NOW*. Unfortunately because I live in America, I have to deal with the less-than-stellar healthcare system. This means that I haven't been able to get my Vyvanse yet because my insurance requires a prior authorization which I totally understand (but I hate it so much, insurance companies needs to DIE). I'm just so eager to start taking it because I'm willing to try whatever helps to get my brain to slow the hell down. There's also a lot of other stuff going on that's contributing to making these feelings worse but they're not that relevant at this moment. 

All of this to say, does anyone have any online journal recommendations? Preferably something that can be used on desktop and/or as an app on my phone (for streamline purposes). I'm okay with it being free or paid! I'm truly grateful and appreciate any suggestions at all! 💙 ";r/adhdwomen;3;9;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1om3goy/online_journal_recommendations/

2025-11-02 06:34:07;Experience switching meds after being on one for almost a year?;I (23) started Adderall last December when I got diagnosed, and after the honeymoon phase and a little bit of tweaking to find the right dose, I settled at 15mg ER + a 5mg IR top-up for my afternoon crashes around February, and was doing really well with this until a couple of months ago. There’s always at least one day a week I go without taking my meds, which my psychiatrist knows, both to avoid a tolerance and honestly because I usually forget a day anyway lol. The issue is that ever since August/early September, I feel like my Adderall has been working maybe 1/3 of the times I take it. The effects I’d really been counting on, like reducing food noise and impulsiveness, better sleep, etc, are completely gone. I have a psych appointment on Monday and I’m considering bringing this up — I have a good rapport with my Dr. and she is experienced in women’s health and hormones specifically, so I do trust her to take me seriously, and I highly suspect that the BC I started over the summer could be a hormonal reason for this change. I’ve just always been nervous to bring these things up, as I’m paranoid about the stimulants stigma and a little nervous to just increase my dosage because I’m also on Wellbutrin, and 15mg is the sweet spot before the combo triggers my anxiety. Has anyone switched meds after being on one for almost a year because they stopped working, and/or Adderall specifically? What was your experience like? I know everyone is different so I’m not asking for medication recommendations or anything, just curious since a lot of the posts I see are about trying to find the right medication in the first few months post-diagnosis.

2025-11-02 05:35:18;I hate telling people my long/short term goals and feeling bad if I haven't accomplished any of them recently or at all.;"So, **I believe I have combined type ADHD (Self Diagnosed). As the title says, I hate telling people about my plans to do something in the future. After some time has passed, maybe a week, a month or two, or even a whole year, some people will ask me about my progress.**

Unless there has been some agreement made between me and another person in which there was an agreed upon deadline that I had to complete a task(s) or present some kind of finished product(s), casually speaking, I know that when people ask me ""how's your such-and-such thing coming along?"" they don't mean to rush me, shame me, or perhaps patronize me, but I can't help but feel all of those things internally.

I have a whole childhood history of how these internalized feelings came to be so critical on the health of my mental and self-esteem, and I won't get into it, but I'll say it primarily stems from my father and the feelings of letting him down in these exact situations.

I said I was going to do something. Said thing didn't get done. I feel like I didn't honor my word. I received chastisement from him (as I got older, I began to chastise myself). I feel shame, stress, the need to overcompensate, etc.

I know this whole thing isn't exclusive to those with ADHD. Other ""normal"" people deal with it as well, but I've been dealing with this for so long that I've **almost** completely stopped telling people shit. Friends, family, I don't like saying anything to them in terms of my goals. I know I don't have to tell them anything to begin with but now it's just like I'm trying to make commitments with myself, and If I don't do something like I told myself I would... I feel ashamed. Admittedly, too, because I KNOW I have (or had) ample time to do said things, accomplish said goals but I get/got distracted by all the things that aren't important.

2025-11-02 05:22:20;Someone snoring is so much worst for ADHD!;"Just sharing this one here for the “oh, so that’s ADHD” (or autism).

One of the post-diagnosis surprises is how much my sensitivity towards sounds worsened. My kryptonite are repetitive noises, especially at a slower or slightly irregular rhythm. Clocks, water dripping, doors banging… they drive me insane.

But nothing like snoring. 

Recently, my partner has started snoring like a freight train.

And it has plunged me into hell. It’s pure torture, not so much for the volume (which is impressive), but for the pitch, the kind of vibration, that very specific moment between one snore and the next which is constant but not always the same length. Of all the possible sound triggers, it’s definitely the worse and it feels like someone is sawing into my brain with an electrics drill while I’m buried under a sea of red ants. I really cannot describe how bad that kind of noise is, just writing this post makes me nauseated.

I don’t blame my partner in the least. They can’t help the snoring. That is not the point of the post. 

It’s just to tell you that if someone’s snoring is akin to physical pain, you’re not alone.

2025-11-02 03:01:38;Undiagnosed adhd to health issues pipeline;"I have PCOS and recently noticed that most of my aquaintances with PCOS or other hormonal issues also grew up in dysfunctional families (tension, stress, rejection), though they're not neurodivergent. I read someplace that constant stress in childhood can affect the way our bodies later develop, especially when it comes to hormones. It makes sense tbh.

I'm wondering if there might be a higher incidence of hormone/health issues later in life for ADHD or other neurodivergent people, simply caused by the stress of the condition itself. Especially if said condition is not diagnosed until adulthood and the person grows up with the guilt+stress of rejection & thinking they're just dysfunctional.

I know IQ isn’t everything and then I start to feel bad for tying my worth to intelligence. I work in the medical field and help support lots of patients with diagnosed intellectual disabilities. Do I think they’re worth less as a human being? Of course not. So why do I think I’m worth less if I’m not capable and intelligent? 

I feel like the people in my life just barely tolerate me and I have to bring more to the table to be worth it. If I’m “stupid” or “incompetent” and these people decide to stop putting up with me what am I supposed to do with myself? 

I just don’t know how to get out of this thought pattern and I’m tired of it holding me back from trying new things and socializing. ";r/adhdwomen;15;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oltbk1/how_to_stop_being_hung_up_on_being_perceived_as/

2025-11-01 23:59:31;Feeling **very** sensitive to metylphenydate;"Hey everyone,

I am newly diagnosed with ADHD. 

For the background:
My doctor told me to follow the following protocol to find what the right dose of metylphenydate for me, before trying to find the right formulation (IR vs ER)

-Begin with 10mg IR (Ritaline) the first week in the morning

-2x10mg IR the second (current week) in the morning

-2x10mg IR in the morning + 10mg at lunch the third week

2x10mg IR in the morning + 2x10mg at lunch the fourth week 

The first week felt pretty bad. Feeling way too anxious, with still having some attention leap sometime. Racing heartbeat then suddenly it could lower. Feeling some light pressure in my chest on the left (light restrosternal pain?)

Second week: felt way less anxious and calmer m, but two very notables things happened.  Still feeling the retrosternal pressure though 

On Wednesday no energy after 3PM felt like the mythical SF Fetanyl zombies people talk about on social medias. Then a rebound. Thought racings and not possible to sleep before 5 am. I messed up by taking the second pill at lunch instead of the two at once, but still it shouldn’t have lasted as long. Called the doc who told me to make sure to take both at once, and report anything in the next days, and that we might need to switch to ER directly

Today until 2hrs ago: 2-3 hours after I felt very cold, had to put a sweat. I also had mild hallucinations. On three instances I saw something happen which didn’t happen. My father taking the car key, or being served first at the restaurant, or thinking I already had taken a coffee, just when the waiter arrived with it

It feels already like advanced intoxication effect at pretty mild dosage 

Sure not taking anything again until seeing my doc + getting an ECG done. But I feel very demoralised right now

Just a few words that externalize the experience I’ve had my entire life. I grew up in a time when girls didn’t have ADHD, especially if you did well academically. I wasn’t diagnosed until my 30’s.

I’ve always felt different. I cannot put on a show; I am truly incapable of pretending I am something other than I am. I actively avoid “fake”, and never quite understood why I had a difficult time maintaining anything that didn’t feel like “me”.

Just thought I’d share this one with y’all in case it hits for anyone else like it did for me.

2025-11-01 23:11:38;Experience with “medication vacations”?;"Hello, Reddit! This is my first post ever so sure hope I am doing this right. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD-C about a year ago. It took over a year to finally get the diagnosis. My PCP prescribes me Adderall (10MG). After a month or two, we increased the dosage (20MG). It has been about 8 months since the increase, and I have felt for a while like it was not working as effectively. I am worried about going up on the dose again for multiple reasons. 

I have heard of people who only take their ADHD medication during the week and stay off of it on the weekend as a solution to this problem. What are your experiences with this? Does this work for you? ";r/ADHD;2;9;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1olq9a8/experience_with_medication_vacations/
2025-11-01 22:56:17;stimulant disappointment?;"Apologies in advance for the long post!

I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD last June through PsychiatryUK and had to wait until September this year to reach the top of the titration waiting list.

While waiting I of course did the classic thing of reading subreddits and watching tiktoks of people saying how stimulants changed their life, made them fully functional, brain was quiet etc, and got my hopes up that I would finally feel like a normal person when I am medicated. I was especially excited for how people described that they could magically get up and do all of the tasks they had been putting off.

For context, I was always seen as a lazy, but anxious, girl. For me the main way that my ADHD manifests is forgetfulness, lack of motivation, difficulty initiating tasks, internal hyperactivity, disorganisation, emotional dysregulation, always burned out and tired.

So I initially was started on 20mg Xaggitin (generic Concerta). The first day I slept for most of the day. But from then on I felt like I was on crack most of the day, my anxiety and jitteriness was sky high and the crash was even worse, I felt like my heart was going to explode! Having anxiety anyway I was already apprehensive about stimulants. I am also already on beta blockers and Escitalopram so there's nothing else I can add on to reduce the anxiety.

I was then switched to Elvanse (or Vyvanse) 30mg, which felt tolerable and smoother, the ""come up"" (sorry don't know how else to describe it) is slower and I don't have a crash. I'm also less anxious than on the Xaggitin, but still more anxious than when I was unmediated.

The main issue is I don't really feel any positive effects regarding my initial ADHD symptoms. I will still lie in bed all day, procrastinate, brain is still like a sieve. I definitely don't get the quiet mind everyone talks about. I've been eating enough protein and drinking tons of water.

It has really helped with the tiredness though. I used to have to drink a lot of caffeine to barely make it through the day, and it doesn't even cross my mind anymore. I also don't binge on food for the dopamine hit anymore.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking really but can anyone relate, offer reassurance or does anyone have any advice?

Thanks! :)

Edit: forgot to say, I have been on 30mg Elvanse for 1 week, then 50mg for 3 weeks ";r/adhdwomen;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1olpvud/stimulant_disappointment/

I’m so relieved to find this Reddit (which honestly I don’t exactly know how to use well!). Please point me to what things I should read, podcasts, etc.  

My family Dr started me on vyvanse 20mg. We are meeting again in 4 weeks to discuss dosage. I’m 160lbs how would I be able to tell if I’m doing well on it or need to up it? She told me some kids are on 20mg so I felt it was low. Does it work like immediately like take in morning and will be able to focus when I sit down to write? Oh yeah I’m also a PhD student to top all this off. 

Also the biggest thing I struggled in is my marriage (being called lazy, not managing household, disorganized). With an official diagnosis I finally feel validated. Would love ways forward I can help my husband understand me. And also our 6 year daughter I 100000% see so much of myself in her and my husband is so hard on her. He always said I was too soft on her and enabled her but it was bc I saw myself in her and knew her brain just couldn’t.

2025-11-01 21:26:03;How to get a diagnosis without childhood evidence?;"I’ve been very easily distracted, couldn’t pay attention, daydreaming and unfocused since I was a kid. I never listened, was a mediocre student and had trouble making friends from like age 3. 

I am finally starting a diagnosis process now at age 25, have been through two sessions but my psychologist mentioned she wants evidence from childhood before referring me to a psychiatrist, which i believe is standard practice. But I can’t get her any.

I will not have any statements from my parents, who are very forgetful themselves and have witnessed many of my “flops” since elementary school, they were even the ones to help me pick up my slack like drive to school since i was in 1st or 2nd grade because i would always forget my homework sitting on the kitchen table, or call up other kids houses to ask for the homework chapter bc i wouldn’t write it down in class. However they are older traditional chinese immigrants and do not believe in mental health or disorders. I have asked them multiple times and they basically said “wtf is this nonsense? don’t waste our time. no you aren’t autistic or whatever that is, now go study.”  

I am not in contact with any teachers, no idea what their names are and most of them probably retired by now. I remember having a favorite third grade teacher who was very kind and understanding with my forgetfulness and she would stay after to help me, but she has sadly passed away many years ago now. 

I have grades from college (could try my best to find high school ones but very unlikely… and def nothing from middle school or earlier …) but i don’t think that will be enough.

I thought this was interesting because I hadn’t thought of any of these things in relation to my (potential) ADHD, and wondered if my consumption habits have anything to do with my attention problems.

2025-11-01 14:31:28;World changing realisation about myself #35: I'm a really not that great in social situations..;"35F diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type) about 2 years ago. Since then it's been a whirlwind journey learning about myself, but one of the things that really hit home recently is the realisation that my social skills may not really be that good at all...

The thing that brought it home: I joined a local gym about 5 years ago - I go to classes a couple of times a week and there's always regulars who chat together before class. I just normally get ready and wait for the class to start... For years I assumed these people already knew each other (i.e. they're friends that go the gym together), but I recently realised they have made friends because they go to the gym together (sounds obvious, doesn't it!). It made me really sad - I completely missed this, is there something wrong with me, am I not able to make friends with people?! 

I used to think I was *great* in social situations - able to chat to almost anyone and always happy and bubbly. I also have a strong ability to read people and understand their motivations (vibe). 

I've since realised my ""social abilities"" only really apply for certain situations that I'm used to and have learnt the ""appropriate mannerisms"", like at work, or a check-out, or at parties. I had treated the gym as a place to exercise, not to meet people 🙄

This realisation totally rocked my self confidence, as I always thought I was great at connecting with people! It may be linked to diagnosis / becoming medicated, but now I feel so awkward in social settings. I realise that this might also be linked to autistic traits (undiagnosed - but seems to fit 😉). 

I have a dwindling group of friends, and the ones I am still friends with are likely ND too. I know this is a common thing for people with ADHD, but it still makes me sad. I have always struggled to maintain friendships - sometimes I'll get along great with someone and it'll just fizzle out. I think this is partly because I am bad at keeping up contact, partly because I think I don't know how to act with people once I get close to them..

My partner said I can miss people's bids for connection, and I know theoretically what he means, but not really sure how to respond in the moment.

Thanks for listening, not really looking for advice (but happy to take any from people who have had similar realisations!). 

TL:DR - I used to think I was great in social situations, but I realised I'm really not, I had just learnt how to act / respond in certain situations. ";r/adhdwomen;18;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1olgxuc/world_changing_realisation_about_myself_35_im_a/
2025-11-01 12:42:02;Do I really have ADHD or do I just have anxiety and caffeine addiction?;"I just got diagnosed by a psychiatrist last week. Well, the psychiatrist said it was an ""initial assessment"" but he said he could tell I had ADHD in the first 20 minutes of our session. He prescribed me some medication after the session. I haven't bought the meds yet and I'm kinda scared to take meds because I read that it can have crazy side effects such as risks of heart attacks and increased hyperacticity if a person who doesnt have ADHD takes them.

I just wanna be extra extra sure I have ADHD before taking medication. I know a literal psychiatrist already told me I have it but I'm just super anxious about it. I also detoxed from any caffeine for 2 days before my diagnosis so that the caffeine effects won't affect my behaviour during the diagnosis. 

Maybe anyone here can confirm if my behaviours/experiences do indeed indicate that I have ADHD?

1. I have a history of extremely disruptive behaviour as early as kindergarten. I got into physical fights with other kids. I never got along with other girls my age because I tend to play rough and I also didn't understand the nuances of like keeping secrets and handling misunderstandings in a non-confrontational manner.

2. In high school, I struggled to fit in because I still liked to play physical games like tag or talk about cartoons. I often moved around in the classroom to chitchat with my friends. Teachers hated it when I volunteered to talk or make jokes. My friends have called me ""childish"" and ""tactless"". 

3. When leaving the house, I find myself going back in again at least 3 times because I forgot an umbrella, a water jug, my ID, keys, etc.

4. I have really good memory when it comes to things I like. I can reacll really specific events from my childhood, books, movies, and video games. I also dont forget deadlines because I like to mark them in my calendar. The things I forget are like mostly physical items that I carry around. 

5. I had bad grades from kinder to highschool but I had no trouble passing the class, I just didnt feel like putting in extra effort to get in the honor rolls? My parents criticized me for that so I made up for it since 11th grade to this day (I am currently a 3rd year law student). Since 11th grade i was able to get high grades but I noticed that I am more prone to depression now? I dont enjoy life as much as I used to. 

6. I like to daydream—A LOT. Walking to the bus stop, riding the bus, driving my car—I listen to music and daydream about characters I made up. Whenever I have to sit in classes I dont like, I dissociate from reality and imagine those characters i made up. 

7. I also like to draw in class. I think aside from video games and movies, drawing is the one thing I can spend hours and hours fixating on. Some days I feel restless because I wanna watch a movie but I also love drawing but I only have time for one thing—so I watch a movie on one screen and draw digitally on the other screen. Or when I have a book I wanna finish, I like to listen to audiobooks while I draw.

8. I like to read fictional books too but that takes a bit of effort, usually I read books when I'm with my family or friends and I cant relate to what theyre doing so I retreat to a world that makes sense. I also read during lunch breaks during class hours while waiting for class to start. I also have to reallllyy like the story otherwise I wont finish the book. 

9. I am bad with social cues. I have trouble knowing when it's my turn to talk. As a kid I had a tendency of talking over others or interrupting them. I can talk for hours and hours without running out of things to say or activities to suggest doing. As an adult, I feel a bit more self conscious about that habit because I've had a lot of people tell me to shut the f up so I just go completely silent until the other person actually asks me ""so what do you think?"" 

10. I was addicted to coffee (1-3 cups a day) from grade 11 to 2nd year law school. I quit last year and replaced coffee with black tea and energy drinks. Without caffeine i just feel like I have a brain fog and I cant function, I just end up zoning out to my imaginary world staring at nothing or watching a movie for hours, not getting anything done. 

11. I tend to make white lies to cover up my incompetence. It's easier to say ""Sorry i was late, yknow traffic haha"" than to say ""I forgot I was supposed to wear a formal attire in the 2x2 ID pic we had to turn in today so I had to get it reprinted twice and I also don't know what the difference between a legal and a long bond paper is so I had to print two copies on both types of papers which  costed an insane amount by the way—which I did not know because I didnt check the prices before printing—also forgot to print the application forms needed so i had to run to another computer shop on the way here to get that printed too.""

12. If I have a stressful event planned ahead, doesnt matter if its an event that will happen in an hour, a week, or in a few months, I will constantly be thinking of strategies to cope for that event. Let's say i have to hangout with an acquaintance next saturday.  I will think ""welp there goes my saturday"" even though it's only like an hour of hanging out and it's like a week away. 

Sorry if this is super long. I just wanted to be thorough. Thoughts? Do i have adhd or is this just anxiety??

* 24/7, I am constantly tense, with my fists curled and back hunched.
* I refuse to listen to rules and instructions because I want to do things fast.
* I spent 8 days compiling a job interview script that I can't recall AT ALL - **NOTHING**.
* I've been using Chat GPT recently (I hate AI but felt like I should try it because I couldn't even write 1 page in 6 hours) and I still can't understand concepts it pushes out.
* I could google something 5 times because I can't bother to watch or read sentences and still leave never learn about the topic.
* I literally just clicked on a documentary and couldn't understand the most basic, clear terminology.
* I never write chronologically, always start new sentences and go back-and-forth. I am in constant fight or flight mode.
* When I percieve something as challenging, I sit down and spend hours pulling at my split ends.
* Thinking the world is ending or everyone hates me when I am embarrassed or make a mistake and ruminate about it everyday for years.

2025-11-01 10:41:39;What are your best metaphors to explain ADHD;"What are some of your favorite metaphors for explaining ADHD to people who have not been diagnosed?

I’ve found that metaphors help more than facts sometimes, especially when trying to show just how overwhelming symptoms can be, and how much difference the right medication or coping strategies can make.

For example: my younger cousin has ADHD, but his parents used to think he just needed to “focus harder.” We’re a visual family, so I opened about 15 tabs on my laptop, started playing multiple YouTube videos at multiple volumes, and asked them to focus on just one and tell me what it was about. When they couldn’t, I told them to “just focus harder.”

That was the moment it clicked for them. I explained that’s what every moment feels like for their son without meds. His mom started crying when she realized how hard life had been for him …she’d never understood how serious it really was. Now that he’s getting the right support, he told her, “It feels like someone turned the lights on.”

It was such a powerful reminder of how life-changing understanding (and treatment) can be.
So I’m curious: what metaphors have helped you explain ADHD in a way that finally lands for someone else?";r/ADHD;438;211;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1old68q/what_are_your_best_metaphors_to_explain_adhd/

2025-11-01 10:18:47;How long did it take your provider to diagnose you?;"After hearing from a few friends that have been diagnosed as adults and who implied it could be good for me, I decided to get evaluated. I met with a psychiatric NP for a 30 minute Zoom session. At the end she began talking about prescribing Wellbutrin for off-label ADHD medication as a starting point to see if it could help and prior to considering any stimulant medications. 

I asked if she wanted me to wait until after I did the evaluations (some very brief multi choice or scale ranking for ADHD) she sent me and she said that the evaluations help support, but she already had made a diagnosis. The assessment visit was short, she mostly just asked questions about my own history and family. Maybe a little bit about how symptoms impact my life (also have depression/anxiety for which I am already medicated). 

It just all felt.. very sudden? When I read about the symptoms, I certainly feel I can relate to them. However I think part of my weariness comes from some doubt or skepticism. Maybe I want to avoid becoming a “quirky” ADHD girlie who self diagnoses because they think it’s interesting or something, just I feel like chalking everything up to being “neurodivergent” is so IN these days. Not that there is anything wrong with true neurodivergence, but I’m not trying to jump on some fad band wagon. I’m trying to sort out my life. 

I have been on Wellbutrin for 4-5 weeks now and feel the same as before. I got an EKG per her recommendation in case we proceed with stimulant medication. We are scheduled to meet again Monday to follow up, at which time I’m thinking we may end up discussing stimulants as a next step. 

My partner has expressed concern due to feeling like out medical industry is undergoing a major overprescribing crisis when it comes to controlled substances like stimulants and especially opioids. I am afraid of the trial and error that comes with all of this and even more afraid to start a stimulant, end up not have ADHD and developing some sort of desire to take the meds anyway. 

Maybe I’m catastrophizing but I think my partner’s concerns and doubts are mixing with my own skepticism and fear. I’ve never taken stimulants even, recreationally, it just never appealed to me. I prefer weed, but did quit smoking a few weeks ago in case I end up having to get a drug test. Quitting smoking for me is/was hard, self control in that area is.. sometimes lacking (probably another factor contributing to my partner’s concern). 

I suppose my question is - is it really that straight forward? So easy to tell that she can spot in over a Zoom session even minutes in? I opted to make an appointment for a second opinion but it’s really hard to get in-office visits in my area, so I settled for another telehealth assessment. 

But is it really so blatant? Have I just been masking my entire life? Obviously I know women and girls are less likely to be diagnosed and more likely to mask but I just feel so.. uncertain? Is this normal? Did anyone else feel this way? This self doubt? 

Thanks in advance. ";r/adhdwomen;2;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1olcraf/how_long_did_it_take_your_provider_to_diagnose_you/

After discovering ADHD a few years ago my entire life finally made sense. Some people I've told about this have sometimes commented things like ""Everyone's a bit ADHD"" /
""Never would have thought you were ADHD, you don't seem very hyperactive..."" 
/ ""you seem like you have your life together"" etc. 
Comments sometimes make me slightly doubt myself, but also...

It's now midnight, I walked upstairs to bed after falling asleep on the couch after going down a Youtube rabbithole and was met with this. 
Rewind 5 hours, I was about to take my daughter trick or treating and was already running a little late to meet her school friends, but spontaneously decided it'd be nice for me to dress up too, and convinced myself it'd only take 30 seconds to get dressed.

I searched the house for a halloween costume I wore 2 years ago and have no idea where I put it. Checked all the wardrobes, cupboards, drawers and then pulled out 2 chaos cases from my wardrobe, tipped them out all over the bed... I didn't find the costume. I left the house, completely forgot about the path of destruction I'd created upstairs. I'm now tired, so shoved everything back in the cases that are now overflowing, and back into the wardrobe with the hope to properly sort them out another day (who am I kidding?). 

Why am I sharing this pointless anecdote? Because today is the day I PROMISED myself, and had every intention, to finally contact my Drs about a ""right to choose"" alternative diagnosis pathway, which should massively speed up the time for diagnosis (discovered this option months ago, thought about it regularly and still hadn't done anything about it). Yesterday I actually called to check where I'm up to on the current wait list, was told it's still a mega wait, so I researched alt companies and filled out a form with every intention of sending it to my drs today (before 1pm when they close enquiries)... and ofc forgot. Again. 

Sometimes all you can do is laugh at yourself, as it's better than being mad at yourself. Reminder to also stand up to people who doubt your struggles, because no. This is my life, all day, every day. Constant chaos.

I mostly needed for work; I think it does help, but I am not sure it helps only because I am taking it rather than its really working; like a placebo. But that's an argument for another day.

General feelings - calmer, less energetic (but I would not say lethargic, maybe this can be attributed to ingesting less sugars). I feel like i am talking significantly slower (I do notice that I take longer pauses, I guess I am thinking more before I talk. I would not say that it is as life changing as others describe; sometimes I doubt myself whether its really working at all. I surely noticed that I can tolerate boredom more.

  
I am more concerned about the side effects that I am going through.

Lack of appetite kicked in with the first pill. Still continues. I've significantly cut down on sweets / sugar. I am overweight, so, maybe that's not too bad.

  
Friday - none; it was a good day.

Saturday / Sunday - I randomly started getting anxious / scared feelings. I knew I didnt have anything to scare me and to be axious about. I've concluded that it is actually palpatations. I also had very poor sleep.

Then the headaches started - headaches around my whole head. Not soul crushing, but obviously present.And annoying. I felt this Monday.

Tuesday / Wednesday. I felt like i am hyper aware of my heartbeats, plus like sort of a bit of tightnening of the chest, like someone is sitting on it. but its not really painful per se; but the feeling is obviously present. BP / HR look OK

Thursday / Friday woke up OK ish, but the headaches have returned.

  
Now, I sit here, 6 hours since my last dose. and I guess my headache has passed a bit. Actually it passed 3 hours my meal.

2025-11-01 05:20:05;Diagnosed at 30 & new to meds. How did you connect the dots between ADHD, med effects, and everything else?;"Hey everyone,  

Curious how others have figured out what’s actually affecting how you feel day to day — whether it’s your meds, hormones, or just life piling up.  

For context: I’m 30F, diagnosed with ADHD this year, and started Adderall XR 20mg about six months ago. Overall, it’s been really positive. I can focus, stay organized, and actually follow through on things instead of bouncing around endlessly. Most days are good and I feel pretty balanced. Also worth noting that I also came off hormonal birth control last year after about a decade on it, and my cycle’s finally stabilizing, so I think hormones could be playing a role too.

But lately, I’ve noticed periods of really intense irritability and mood swings — like I go from fine to snapping over the smallest thing. It’s been getting worse the last couple of months, so I’ve started tracking my mood, cycle, and sleep more closely to see if there’s any pattern.

At the same time, I’ve had a lot of external stress — work pressure, living alone, two dogs (one with health stuff), and feeling more financial strain — so there’s no shortage of possible factors. Still, the irritability and just general mood swings have been feeling kind of extreme lately, but it ebbs and flows and isn’t an everyday thing even when those external factors are.  

A family member who also has ADHD and takes Vyvanse told me I should get off Adderall because her psychiatrist said it can cause that, and she called it “madderall,” which honestly freaked me out a bit. But I’m really struggling to tell if that’s what’s happening for me or if it’s more about everything else going on, or maybe even a combination of things. I don’t want to mess with something that’s otherwise helping so much if this isn’t really med-related. At the same time, I don’t want to ignore it if it is. 

So I’m curious — how did you know when it was time to change meds or adjust your dose? And if you switched from Adderall XR to something else (Vyvanse, another stimulant, or even non-stimulant), what was that transition like for you?  

Would love to hear your experiences or advice on sorting this stuff out.";r/adhdwomen;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ol6lpc/diagnosed_at_30_new_to_meds_how_did_you_connect/

I have never had a good relationship with alcohol, but for weird reasons that it seems to me might be related to my ADHD. 

I don't tend to relate to alcoholism and the stories that I've heard of what it's like for alcoholics. I know it's different for everyone, but I can't say I ever really *want* to drink. The only reason I do is the social necessity and how boring it is to hang out with drunk people when you're sober. 

When I do drink, my main issue is that I drink very fast and don't ever seem to have a voice saying ""hey you're a little drunk, maybe slow down"". I just cannot for the life of me pace myself. My doctor even prescribed me naltrexone which is supposed to inhibit the opiods receptors and it doesn't really help because the pleasurable feelings of alcohol aren't really what's driving things. 

If I had to take a guess, my main way of getting through life for years before my diagnosis was to ""immediately do the thing"" before I forgot or started to procrastinate. I do everything fast including eating and drinking. And it feels like when I'm drinking alcohol I always feel like ""This drink is the thing in front of me that needs to be done, have to finish it and move on to the next thing"".

I finally got officially diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago. Even tho it's been 2 years, it really has been a struggle trying to understand myself. I sort of had an inkling years ago that I may have ADHD but growing up in a culture that places a lot of stigma around mental health, I kept getting put down and told that everyone is a little bit ADHD. I did eventually see a doctor specialized in ADHD while I was in university, but I was partaking in some risky behaviours to self-medicate, so he said he couldn't fully diagnose me yet. He was afraid that I would abuse ADHD medications and wasn't 100% sure about my level of success at that time.

It wasn't until going through some mental breakdowns the next few years that someone finally took me seriously and diagnosed me. It's been a total revelation since then. The things that I used hate myself for because I just couldn't keep up with everyone else despite having so much in my head and this want to do things but somehow I just couldn't make myself. Those comments that I was lazy, stupid (someone used to literally insert dumb into my name because they thought I was slow lol), or could reach my potential if I just tried. It all makes sense now. 

After trying different medications and finding the right one. Wow! It's crazy how different it is for me during the day when I'm actually medicated. The depression and anxiety creep in less and I finally feel less insecure about myself. It helped even more finding subreddits and communities such as these. To finally relate to people who understand this struggle and know that this is just who I am and that's okay.

2025-11-01 00:46:52;Newbie to Adderall, odd first week. Was your first week confusing?;"  Dx for inattentive adhd a month ago at age 56. , had hard time believing it but started on 10 mg Adderal last week.  
   First couple days, 10 mg in morning and afternoon, and felt no effects. Third day, after 10 mg in am, I had rush of motivation (house cleaning), almost to point of manic but not quite. Good motivation continued for 3 days, but dropped off. Next day increased dose to 15 mg am and pm for next few days but motivation did not return.  I will says my racing mind did slow, and my SI is less. AOE have similar experience?

   As side note, I've been reading adhd posts here since being diagnosed, and honestly so many of the ""symptoms"" and behaviors people describe are ones I DON'T have.  And adds to this sense that maybe I don't have adhd.

2025-10-31 23:46:48;"""Transition Coaching"" Has Revolutionized My Life - Task Switching Suggestion";"I have been back to work after a month leave (where I was diagnosed, got medicated and therapy) and wasn't sure how I was doing. It felt like I was making progress managing some symptoms, but I was still burnt out every day, just as I had been before seeking professional help. I finally hit a wall yesterday morning and felt myself trending toward depression again and a complete crash, like my brain was constantly seconds away from just force quitting itself. And this was after I had noticeably downshifted a couple weeks ago and started ""quiet quitting"" (I know that's not a popular word, but I think it fits into a new context with adhd. We often operate at a higher level with anxiety, hyper fixation, and perfectionism, so quiet quitting is the perfect extreme to make ourselves slow down).

Anyways, I was doing some journaling and realized how I still continue to struggle with task switching. I had an idea to start ""transition coaching"" where I just tell myself ""Hey, we're transiting into this now"" and it has revolutionized everything. Before, at work, if I got a call or a walk in, I would feel my energy leaking so much trying to pause what I was doing to respond to the sudden request. Now, when something comes up or I want to do something, literally anything like going to get water or standing up, I take a breath, take it slow, and tell myself ""Okay, we're transitioning from this to going to get some water"" and it feels so much better! I feel like I'm preserving so much mental energy during the day and not completed exhausted after work.

The funny thing is since doing this I've felt super light headed, and I think it's because my body is adjusting to not running off anxiety and hyperarousal anymore haha.

I know everyone is different but hope this posts resonates with you and you can use it for your benefit! We all got this!";r/ADHD;439;41;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oky4ie/transition_coaching_has_revolutionized_my_life/
2025-10-31 22:59:42;Do stimulant medications make obsessive thoughts worse?;"
I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking stimulant medication for about three years. Lately, I’ve started to feel like it might be worsening my obsessive thoughts.

Before treatment, I only had mild mental obsessions that didn’t affect my day much. But since starting the medication, I’ve noticed that I sometimes fixate on very small or unimportant things, to the point that it ruins my day—especially when I have too much free time.

I stopped taking it for about a week and felt much calmer. The obsessive thoughts went back to a mild level.

2025-10-31 20:49:50;Comorbid Issues with ADHD and Efficacy;"I have been diagnosed June '23 with ADHD -PI and dysthymia (October 2024); which I was told is untreatable.

I do see many people struggle with efficacy of stimulants alone, my experience; I can say the synergy with Elvanse and the effectiveness was with one particular SSRI with only one generic working. I had been consistently taking Fluoxetine 20mg for 18 months, usual morning tiredness from it's side effects, trialled both night and day time schedules no difference. Also, had 5-6 generics, as it's just what the pharmacy get when ordering but I have had consistent generics for as long as 7 months, that I would deem ineffective. If anyone thought about consistency with another generic. So, one day the pharmacy had given me a generic I had previous been on (only thing to move depression and lift mood but only for 2 weeks this was before ADD diagnosis) this generic was like taking a completely different medication, which I would say I reached optimal level of functioning and mood.

3 psychiatrists I have mentioned this to, when at my reviews ignore this fact and it is a fact.

This leaves to question, what are pharmaceutical companies allowed to substitute - such as fillers & blinders, the formulation is the formulation?

My GP recognises this as as issue, as he confirm many patients saying the same issue arises with side effects or just intolerable to another generic.

What's doctor's thought process here, ignorance or dismissing, due to too many variables to consider?

 

Another point is, I have said this again on my reviews, same psychiatrists, which have dismissed this. When titrating dosage on an SSRI or stimulant, I reach optimal level in weeks 1 - 3. Again wasn't a SSRI I got on with, as it caused high frustration/anger on any task but during second dose increase, although, this was now trading off returning ADD symptoms, I still got insight of emotions I rarely experience daily, such as confidence, libido and good mood.

I'm trying to understand the medications pharmacology to look for presynaptic common factors, as I have been on 8 various anti-depressants/ psychotics alone and combined with noted data on my experience with them. The problem now could be, due to stimulants correcting my main issue but still highly ineffective on their own as I am off anti-depressants due to the inevitable period of 6 - 8 after dosage increase of stimulants or even switching antidepressant or increasing, the stimulants switch off 100%, full ADD symptoms are back and yes my mood is ok but it's back to the drawing board. Now, I know its the anti-depressant due to variation in generics, with fluoxetine i discovered after this 6 - 8week period and I get a new prescription of a brand I now deem 'neutral' the stimulant comes back on but far from effective level I was once at.

Some may think why not stay on the generic that worked, NHS only obtain supply to the hospitals, and general public / pharmacies have an impossible time of requesting a medication which they have many of on hand. First time, I phoned over 100 pharmacies Scotland and England as we have a stupid system where nothing in linked; even the same pharmacies can't see national, regional or local stock. Then contacted the pharmaceutical company headquarters, confirmed they had an active contract in place and said there supplier was X,Y & Z, supplier said we only deal with hospitals. NHS procurement I opened a case with confirmed this. 

I have to say why is the medical industry so inept, I mean more than half the work I have done and previous done is because I had no choice; it was suicide or research as could no long leave it to doctor office - wheel of fortune medication selection. So, again psychiatrist who I thought I trust with their expertise to work through this problem and I'm giving them the main issues anyway I can and it's just the same, ""no know interactions between these medications"".

Anyone had similar experience with medication and how you worked through it?

2025-10-31 20:37:03;My wife is autistic and I've got denied a diagnose because of that;"First of all, my main language is not English, so my bad if any spelling mistakes.

So, my wife (30F) and I (31M) are together in a relationship for 17 years, friends for 18 years.
She got diagnosed 1 year ago with ""level 1 support"" Autism and Giftedness. She pretty much has a hyper focus on human behavior all of her life, more than we are together.

I've always lived my life pretty much rawdogging, it's been painful and I am exhausted. My family have always been the kind of family of ""No medication"" ""Anxiety only come when you are lazy"" type of family, I don't judge them, My mom only got the education for 4th grade, started working around 12 and never stopped, she is the best mom I've could asked for, but got some issues.

So, I decided to get help seeing that my wife (and I) got a lot better with her diagnose and all my friends, family, doctors, teachers...all of them says that I'm ADHD/Autistic....

So here I am, getting my diagnose of... Anxiety... and the explanation? My wife is autistic, so, all the things that she said about me (things that she sees, hear, judged...) is wrong, because she is autistic.

The doctor told me that my wife is always wrong about people, and everything that she said (a 46 pages document about my life (I told you she has a hyper focus?)), he took the opposite as true.
Like, he blatantly told me:
She said that you are very unquiet as kid, so I presume you aren't, she just are projecting ADHD in you.

I made a promise to myself and my wife to seek help with another professional, but this is pretty much exhausting. 

I really hoped that I only got diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD/Autism is hell.";r/ADHD;197;28;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oktef5/my_wife_is_autistic_and_ive_got_denied_a_diagnose/

2025-10-31 14:33:00;Feel overly jumpy/skiddish, Guanfacine helps but reduces my focus. Any ideas or suggestions? Not quite sure what to do next;"So to start out, I’ve been on Adderall XR plus 2 IR boosters throughout the afternoon for a little over a year. I’ve tried Vyvanse, but it barely helped my concentration at all. Long story short, I’ve determined (since I’m more inattentive than hyperactive) that the norepinephrine boost adderall gives me is the main drive behind my focus, and I can’t focus well without it—which is part of the reason Vyvanse didn’t work well.

I was previously on Adderall and Guanfacine 1mg ER for a while; I noticed immediately that I didn’t feel a sudden drop in my stomach after making eye contact with someone, or feel unreasonably nervous at the thought of an interaction. However, guanfacine does seem to make my baseline attentiveness a bit worse (it calms your nervous system but also in turn reduces NE levels), even though it helps in many other ways. It seems to relax me/my nervous system, but that affects the amount of attention I’m able to direct towards things like driving. I’m now on Strattera 80mg + Adderall, and am trialing 0.25-0.5mg guanfacine IR to see if that can possibly provide a good middle ground for me since 1mg is the lowest dose of ER. But the more this goes on and the more thought I give it, I just don’t know if I should stick with guanfacine or possibly try another medication. My psych wrote a script for me to try 50mcg-100mcg of Clonidine, but I’ve heard it’s even more sedating than Guanfacine.

Me and my psych also thought about propranolol, but due to me having mild asthma a few years prior, he obviously wants to try other things first before going there (and also wants me to get another inhaler beforehand, just in case). But it’s starting to seem like the symptoms I’m experiencing are less related to complete social anxiety, and more of a nervous system response/some sort of PTSD/CPTSD or PTSD-like symptoms (since my childhood would align with that). Given that information, what recommendations do you guys have and what’s worked for you? I’m a bit lost and just want to feel better. Guanfacine makes me feel so much less scared/timid, and makes people not seem so intimidating and threatening—but it still does make me inattentive, and I’d rather feel a bit on edge and drive safely, than feel comfortable but be at risk for an accident. Any similar experiences? I’m definitely not looking for any diagnosis or medical advice, just your own personal experiences and what helped you.

To me, this sounds like typical 5yo behavior. However, on his “behavior chart” that is sent home with him, most of his “bad” marks are from him being off task.

I have considered going through the school district to have him evaluated for ASD and ADHD, it’s just a lengthy process and his dad and I are divorced. I also have ADHD and started on Adderall in 3rd grade.

I am stuck working on a project that I feel makes no-sense, with a demanding junior team mate who calls me all the time for every little thing, that doesn't listen to me nor learn, and overall I dont really get along with them.

The point though is that my coworker, regardless of the quality of their code, manage to close their tasks while I always find myself stuck in the same spot, i feel paralyzed and anxious all the time.

I really dread the idea of working on this project, the structure is confusing for me, full of antipatterns, I cant think clearly when the code base is so messy. To make things worse the few time I actually try to do something I find myself unable to do the silliest things, I forget stuff I studied just weeks ago and I move with the sluggiest pace, and this push me away from the work even more.

I am considering quitting, really, I feel ashamed of not putting my weight at work considering how welcoming the rest of the team was and how everyone is pretty chill, even the boss, so i don't wanna be the lazy guy that cause the management to enforce crazy rules for everyone.

We work in full remote and we catch up rarely, most of the time weekly sometimes every 2 weeks (aside from that co worker that calls me everyday..), I spend most of the week at home with my aging parents, more often that I would admit I cant bring myself to shower, during those anxious days of inactivity I end up staying up till late in the desperate attempt to make something out of my days, so in the morning I am even more tired

His main complaint has always been “my tummy hurts” and he wants us to “promise me I am not sick”. He has done CBT, talk therapy, grief counselling and EMDR currently. The biggest issue we experience is school phobia. He is terrified to go to school. Three years we have fought this battle. He has also been diagnosed with adhd, and a learning disability tending toward math. The biggest problem seems to be he is afraid to separate from us. We see this is all aspects of his life. He will not sleep over with trusted grandparents anymore, go to friends houses, has great anxiety around these things and always always seeks reassurance that he’s not sick before he goes anywhere. Finally a psychiatrist has recommended meds and we are ready for this. He started on 5mg fluoxetine 2 weeks ago. We see no side effects but obviously no helpful effects either. I am hopeful when we see the dr in a few days he will titrate up. My question is for people who have experienced school phobia in their adhd/anxiety kids. Did you use fluoxetine?

2025-10-25 18:30:41;Two days on Concerta. I feel scammed;"Hi, 38M here, recently diagnosed. I live with depression and anxiety too for many years. But this year I'm trying to turn my life around and finally look for help: A therapist and a psychiatrist that diagnosed me with ADHD. She also told me that she wouldn't give anything for anxiety and depression because mixing stuff is dangerous, so she wanted to see if we could tackle the ADHD problem first.

This is my second day on Concerta, 18mg. Yesterday was...disappointing, to say the least.

I work from home with my computer (I'm a 3d Artist), Same level of laziness, unable to follow tasks, procrastinating, and hundreds of browser tabs open as usual.

I keep reading on the adhd subreddit on how people's lives suddenly magically change the first day on Concerta (18mg, I'm supposed to switch to 36mg in a week), I feel scammed. My two friends with ADHD always talked about how their lives changed the first day when they got their meds, like having superpowers to get shit done.

But my sister is a doctor, and she says no medication acts like they (or the people in the adhd subreddit) describe on the first day.  
So are my friends (and redditors) getting a placebo effect, and in reality, it takes days or weeks to work, or somehow it doesn't work for me?

At first, I only felt a weird pulse on my head as if my heartbeat was slightly faster, but that's it. No energy boost, no capacity to stick to the task without drifting, and procrastinating.

Today, the second day, is worse. I feel the weird pulse and dizziness, and none of the supposed benefits of it. I'm actually scared that when i double my dose in a few days I would feel like utter crap.

Has anyone felt like this? Did you had similar experiences? What solutions did your doctors gave you?  
EDIT: Everyone is being very supportive, thanks. I will be patient, watch my hydration and talk to my psychiatrist after one month if I see no changes. Thank you all!";r/adhd_anxiety;4;31;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ofo8vt/two_days_on_concerta_i_feel_scammed/
2025-10-25 09:00:30;Executive dysfunction or exhaustion;"For some context I was only diagnosed this year, although I've been living under the assumption I was ADHD for years now. Meds have been incredibly helpful for me and have given me a bit of a new lease on life. I feel like I am so much more productive. I can actually focus on creative projects at home and get them done instead of spending so much time without the energy to do anything more than browse the Internet or play video games.
 

But with that said, now it can catch me off guard when I do have those days when I feel like I can't move. It's frustrating because I know sometimes I just need to rest, and I am also not great on reading my body's cues. But then there are days like today when I really wanted to get stuff done but feel completely unable to move. I don't know if I've been burning the candle at both ends or if this was just a tough day at work but I've been exhausted since I got home and it's so annoying. This is the kind of thing that makes ADHD feel more like a disability than anything else.

2025-10-23 18:48:09;Adhd and antidepressant;"Hey,
I’ve tried a bunch of different antidepressants for depression and anxiety, and I just switched to a new one.

My psychiatrist doesn’t do ADHD assessments, so it took a while to finally get diagnosed. The problem is that this new antidepressant is making my anxiety worse (which I know can happen at first). I’ve also heard that a lot of ADHD meds can have the same side effect.

I’m kinda worried my anxiety will spiral if I’m taking multiple meds that both make it worse but at the same time, I really need treatment for all three things because I’m not very functional right now.

Has anyone else been through something like this?

(I have not started adhd medication as my psych is waiting for the antidepressant to stabilise)";r/adhd_anxiety;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1oe011n/adhd_and_antidepressant/
2025-10-23 16:19:50;I feel like my medication isn’t really helping…?;"okay so I wanted to put this up to discuss my condition and how I have been dealing with adhd. So I have been diagnosed with adhd since like 3 months ago i think..? I was first prescribed 18mg of concerta by my doctor but that didn’t do anything so the doctor upped it to 27mg of concerta. 

Ever since then my appetite has been slowly decreasing and I usually don’t eat at lunch since that's when my medication reached its peak and that's when my appetite is completely surpressed. In general I have also been eating less even after the medication wear off. Which as I have read and been told of is a common effect and it has never bothered me that much. However I couldn’t feel my concentration improving. 

During my first few weeks I certainly felt more awake from my medication and was able to slightly focus better..? (I can't remember much but I do remember feeling more awake.) I usually take my medication at 8-9am on weekdays and 10am-11am on weekends since I wake up later. I have been stuck with 27mg for a month before I visit my doctor again. When I did he said he wanted to continue the same dosage (eventho I was skeptical and kinda wanted to try a higher dosage since I felt like 27mg wasn’t really doing much or anything at all but I listened to my doctor either way since he dismissed my concerns and he is the doctor.) and asked me to come back in three months after my score for term 2 is released, which is around the end of December. 

Right now, I am facing alot of struggle though. These past 2 weeks, I feel like my medication hasn’t really woken me up, I often feel quite sleepy despite taking the medication to the point that I could sleep if I tried. I did take a couple of naps when the medication was supposed to reach its peak effect. I have been getting about 7 hours of sleep and sometimes more on weekends but still I do still feel quite sleepy and tired after waking up, not as much on weekends tho since I slept longer. I am not sure why the medication isn’t waking me up as it did before anymore? 

Despite my sleep schedule remaining quite the same and if anything I got more sleep than before since I used to sleep less. It has been posing quite the issue lately, because during my maths exams I have been making very careless mistakes that result in a lot of decreased marks. 

The other day I thought that the gradient of  3x+2y = k was 3 but I didn’t see that it was for 2y and that the y was on the same side as the x. And just today I completely forgot to add another x to my equation. And somehow I also completely forgot to add two to my number which would have signalled me of a mistake since it would make my number higher by 2 than the given total. Just because of this all my parts a,b,c,d are wrong. So I felt like the medication isn’t doing its job except suppressing my appetite. It had happened before back then when I was on 18mg, I knew how to draw a histogram and a cumulative frequency graph but I completely blanked out in the exam. And I used the cumulative frequency for my histogram instead of finding the actual frequency. I knew how to do everything, it really wasn’t the lack of practice. If asked to do everything again I would have done everything correctly. It’s just during exams, especially maths, my brain tends to fly away. By that I mean instead of focusing on the questions and the exam itself, my brain starts remembering random stuff like the video I watched the other day, or the music I watched the other day or the chat I had with my friend the other day. So like I could be going okay so 20-3=17 and then next plus 2 oh wait! The video the other day! Dang that was so funny! In my head. I hope that it makes sense idk if this kind of stuff is normal😭and then I lose my calculation and forget where I ended up. Like I have to read the question multiple times just to get my brain to process since it tends to wander off to other topics as I do it. If I didn't, I am confident I could understand it the first time I read it. It really has been causing me lots of careless mistakes. Because then I miss the important details. 

Proscatination is also another issue. I tend to be so tired after school that I have no energy to do work and even if I did I tend to stand up and walk around every 10 mins or so or like to wander off to do sth else instead of focusing on my task. It’s kinda hard to stay focused but sometimes I am able to. Even these days I tend to forget a lot of stuff often, like my keys, my bag, and charging my devices. I believe I need an increase in dosage. But I am not seeing my psychiatrist in another 2-3 months and I cannot move it earlier to see him because he is working in Singapore and I live in Indonesia so I can't always fly there to see him as plane tickets are expensive and I can’t often skip school. What should I do? Shall I try taking two doses of the concerta med to see what happens? Also why does it seem to work better in the first few weeks then just go back to being not effective. 

Tbh even when I took the medication it was never that effective in the first place(despite being increased to 27mg), but I felt like it got worse. I used to get very good grades but it has since dropped due to this. I don’t want to get bad grades because of this, what can I do as a temporary solution? (Also I might update this post tmr since it’s late and I kinda need to go to bed rn.

2025-10-23 15:01:11;"Random ADHD hacks that finally worked after years of failing at ""normal"" productivity";"Been dealing with ADHD my whole life but only diagnosed last year at 31. Tried all those hyped up productivity systems and failed miserably every time. Made me feel even worse about myself tbh.

Finally found some weird approaches that actually work with my brain instead of against it. Nothing groundbreaking, just stuff that stuck:

* Body doubling has been shockingly effective. I use Focusmate for important tasks after a friend recommended it and suddenly I can work for 50 mins straight without checking my phone 600 times.
* The ""ugly first draft"" approach for work projects. I tell myself I'm TRYING to make it terrible on purpose, which somehow bypasses my perfectionism paralysis.
* Deleting social apps from my phone during workdays. Can reinstall on weekends. The friction of having to reinstall stops most of my impulsive checking. Tried the social media blocking apps but they never stuck, so I just delete them directly myself now.
* Found this Inbox Zapper app that helped me clear out a bunch of daily junk emails so I'm not facing one giant overwhelming list. My inbox used to give me legit anxiety, now it's much quieter
* I use Soothfy for short, varied micro-activities throughout the day to keep boredom and that dopamine crash at bay. Switching between quick brain puzzles, mini mindfulness moments, or tiny grounding tasks helps me reset my focus and keeps things feeling fresh like giving my brain little novelty hits. These tiny shifts add up and make a big difference in how motivated and alert I stay.
* Switched from to-do lists to time blocking. Lists made me feel like a failure when I couldn't finish them. Now I just move blocks around instead of carrying over undone tasks. I still go back to my Todoist app every once in a while for specific things, just not as my main tool.
* ""Weird body trick"" - keeping a fidget toy AND gum at my desk. Something about the dual stimulation helps me focus way better on calls.
* Stopped forcing myself to work when my meds wear off. Those last 2 hours of the day are now for mindless admin tasks only.

2025-10-23 11:09:54;Has anyone’s driving experience gotten better when becoming mediated?;"(M22) Ever since I got diagnosed with ADHD for the first time this year, and got on a good combo that works for me , (Vyvanse, Viibryd, Clonodine & Propanolol) I have truly enjoyed driving like 100% more than I did. Before becoming medicated I hated it due to being unable to focus, and having to keep the window down constantly only because something is blowing in my face, and in turn reminding me that I need to focus on the road. I also would just disassociate a lot and would just trying to not think about anything other than random scenarios, that would in turn just stop because my mind would race.

Now that I feel like I’m more productive, and can focus, and like can lock in essentially, driving has turned into my coping skill to be honest, I actually look forward to it. Only because it feels like I have a sense of self control, and can lock in, and completely focus on the road, and also day dream. I tend to day dream a lot of scenarios or fantasies about like my favorite fictional characters (lmao i’m too old to be doing this, but it’s a coping skill that genuinely has helped me since i was really young), and I do it a lot while driving and it just makes it more enjoyable. Also when I am not like daydreaming, I tend to be able to process my thoughts and feelings, talk it out with myself, and get straight to the point, and think things out all critically and figure out what’s the best move for myself.

Idk, I’ve also struggled with major depression, with medications not working for me, and it just truly feels like life is so much more enjoyable. My mood is truly better, I have so much self control on myself with impulse purchases, or impulse emotions, idk stable. Like I feel normal, and for the first time ever. Learning how to make boundaries, learning how to talk out my feelings without getting angry, learning to be okay with who I am as a person. It’s rlly nice to be honest, and I know I have a ways to go, but I am getting there!

Also, if anyone did read this far, I lowkey have another question. Recently I have been struggling a bit with staying on task while doing homework for school, and just keep getting distracted (they upped my dose to 40mg yesterday cuz i mentioned this), but what are other things that have helped?

If you’re still with me so far, I’ve only been on TWO ADHD MEDS. During my most recent med management appointment she’s like, “ well I don’t really know what to do, there aren’t many other medications  for us to try”.

I’m sorry what?? There are so many more ADHD meds. Keep in mind I have never asked for specific or stimulant medication and I’m not against it either.

They have mentioned without me initiating the conversation that they think stimulants would make my anxiety worse. I figured out when starting ADHD meds that that “anxiety” was actually overwhelm from dealing with all of my ADHD symptoms.

They believe that if I were to be put on a stimulant that I would hyper fixate on my anxiety. Make it make sense.

2025-10-23 03:26:39;Is ADHD evaluation supposed to cost $200?;"I live in Michigan, US. It seems like all the psychiatric places I've called around me have a similar way of evaluating ADHD, which is: patient intake -> some kind of test -> follow up. The intake and follow up should be fine because my insurance just gives me a basic copay.

But the test is always something like $150-$200 according to my insurance (Edit: not including the two copays). And it seems like all the places I've called have some kind of test required. I think I've contacted 3-4 places. The one I'm about to take is an online exam I can do at home with a questionnaire + an interactive attention test I think.

With some other posts I read it seemed like you could just get diagnosed through normal appointments, by talking to your provider. Maybe it's different because I'm seeing an NP and not a Psychiatrist. So I wanted to ask for your experience if you live in the US or Michigan specifically, did they require some kind of test, or did you get your ADHD diagnosis through normal appointments where you just talk to your provider?

2025-10-22 08:49:20;!!!!!!! advice needed... please help.. :(;"I really don’t know where else to turn for advice, but I’m hoping someone here can help because I’m truly at my wits’ end. I’m three months postpartum, and while I know this isn’t a postpartum group, I can’t deny how much it’s worsened my anxiety. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, usually triggered by specific situations. But lately, it’s gotten so bad that even my usual sleep medication doesn’t work. I’m utterly exhausted, but the physical symptoms—heavy chest, heart palpitations, adrenaline rushes—keep me up, along with racing thoughts. The worst part? There’s no real *reason* for it. It’s like I’m anxious *about* being anxious and not sleeping, which makes me feel completely crazy.

This has happened four times in the past two weeks. It’s affecting me as a wife and mom and keeping me from going back to work because I can’t function when I’m so sleep-deprived. I was diagnosed with ADHD four years ago, and once medicated, my life improved so much—my focus, mood, and even anxiety. But now, even with my ADHD meds (20mg instant release in the morning and an occasional afternoon booster), I’m struggling. I don’t breastfeed, so medication options aren’t limited. Normally, if I feel anxious or can’t sleep, a benzo helps—but recently, it hasn’t. Twice I’ve gone 24–48 hours with almost no sleep.

I feel so defeated. My psychiatrist, therapist, EMDR therapist, and OB/GYN all seem to just throw meds at me without really helping. It’s breaking my heart because my husband and kids mean everything to me, and I hate feeling like this version of myself.

I was prescribed sertraline but have always been hesitant about SSRIs because of bad reactions as a teen—though maybe it’s different now. I’m considering taking it at night while keeping my ADHD meds in the morning. I was also prescribed Seroquel for bad nights, but I’m scared because it’s often used for bipolar/schizophrenia, which I don’t have, even though it’s a low dose.

If anyone here takes both ADHD and anxiety meds or has gone through something similar, please share what’s worked for you—especially for those awful nights with racing thoughts and physical anxiety.

2025-10-22 04:56:59;Got assessed for ADHD/GAD through my therapist’s clinic psychiatrist is this typical? It feels a bit underwhelming;"I’ve been seeing a therapist for about a year. She referred me to a psychiatrist in her practice to do a general mental health assessment for ADHD, depression, anxiety, etc. since I've suspected it for a while, and my treatment plan with my therapist considered it as well. 

They reviewed my progress together and looked at some Greenspace assessments I’d filled out in the last year or so.

After a couple appointments, the psychiatrist mentioned anxiety and ADHD They suggested possibly starting medication (Strattera).

What’s throwing me off is that’s kind of it. There weren’t any long testing sessions or detailed questionnaires beyond what I’d already done. It feels strange to have something I’ve suspected for years finally confirmed, but in such a quick way?

I’m not doubting the psychiatrist, they seemed thoughtful and took the time to talk through everything. It just feels odd that something that’s impacted me for so long can be summed up so quietly and.. casually?

Is this the typical route for diagnosis? Did it feel like this for any of you? Or am I missing a step somewhere? Can I even consider it an official diagnosis? 


TL;DR: Saw a therapist for a year, got referred to a psychiatrist within that clinic for a general mental health assessment. After a couple of appointments and reviewing past questionnaires, psychiatrist confirmed ADHD, social anxiety, and GAD and suggested Strattera. No long testing or detailed assessments.

I have been procrastinating the work since the beginning of the break and after the 1st week I found it incredibly hard to start anything. I was literally unable to pick up a pen and start writing.

my mom complains about me saying she can’t sleep at night because she’s so scared for me. she thinks I don’t care about schoolwork and my future at all, and that I am just lazy and ungrateful. i have a huge ego when it comes to talking to my parents, and I won’t admit that I’m struggling or that I need help, in fear that they will just call it an excuse and that I’m actually just a lazy brat. so instead I act arrogant and talk back. I have been crying every night now, because I am so tired at the end of the day, even after doing literally nothing, not even physical exercise. apart from not studying I am unable to pursue my hobbies or do physical exercise . i am unable to even drink enough water and my skin is suffering bcoz of that. i end up scrolling on my phone and when my phone is taken away, I sit at my desk doing nothing. this is why I dread holidays, even though I await them.

I feel my parents might know I have adhd but they don’t want to get me diagnosed because it’ll limit my career opportunities or smthn.

2025-10-22 00:55:39;Needing some advice on ADHD+ ANXIETY :(;"I really don’t know where else to turn for advice about this, but I’m hoping this community can help me because I’m truly at my wits end. I know this isn’t a group for postpartum by any means but I am currently three months postpartum and I know it has an effect on how bad my anxiety has gotten. 
Long story short I have suffered with anxiety since I can remember. The majority of the time my anxiety is surfaced based on an event or specific situation that happens and or something I’m nervous about days leading up to it and what not. 
Lately it’s gotten so bad to the point where even my normal sleeping medication that always puts me to sleep is not working and I literally just toss and turn all night even though I’m so tired my physical anxiety symptoms keep me awake as well as my racing thoughts and no matter what I do or try, I can’t fall asleep. This has happened four times in the last two weeks and it’s not only affecting me as a wife and mother, but also preventing me from going back to work because I physically can’t do my job when I’m sleep deprived.
I know I’ve had anxiety my entire life and like I said for the most part, I manage it well and it’s kind of just dormant in my body, unless surfaced by a specific situation or event. I was diagnosed with ADHD about four years ago and once medicated, my life got significantly better in every aspect . I made it through school because I was finally properly medicated. I was happier all around just felt better about everything in general and my anxiety was lessened again unless a specific situation triggered it. 

I’m reaching out to this community in hopes that somebody has been in my position and can help give me some guidance or direction on where they think I should turn because my psychiatrist, therapist, EMDR therapist, OB/GYN none are helping me. I feel like they’re all just throwing different medications at me to get me out of their office And it’s breaking my heart. 
My children mean the absolute world to me and my husband is the greatest thing and I’m so tired of going through these episodes because it affects me as a wife and a mother and I can’t live like that.  

So a small inside to what my life has looked like lately: once I was cleared after I had my third baby I went back to taking my daily dose of Adderall, which is 20 mg instant release in the mornings and then if I needed a booster in the afternoons, I would do that also. I am not breast-feeding so medication options aren’t limited. If I have trouble, falling asleep or feel a little anxious, I will take a clonazepam and 99% of the time that does the job and puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep. But for some reason, four times in the past two weeks despite having absolutely no reason specifically to be so anxious I get an overwhelming physical feeling of anxiety in my chest and racing thoughts. Keep me awake literally the entire night two weeks ago I went 48 hours with no sleep Last week. I went 24 hours no sleep and again last night could not fall asleep did not fall asleep until four in the morning, even though I laid down at 10 PM. 

I know this is so long and I’m so sorry but if you’ve read this far, thank you so much and I love you. I’m basically at the point where I have to decide. Do I start taking sertraline that was prescribed to me because I really don’t like anxiety and depression pills I’ve had bad effects when I was a teenager, but maybe it’s different now that I’m in my 30s. 
So I’m thinking to stick with my Adderall in the mornings and then take the sertraline before I go to bed at night as a daily med to help with my anxiety. Also, on the nights that my clonazepam doesn’t work when I have those bad, anxious symptoms and racing thoughts, I was prescribed Seroquel, but I’m really scared to take that because I read it for bipolar schizophrenic people which I’ve never been diagnosed with. Granted it’s a really low dose, but still scares me.

Anyways, if you’ve ever dealt with something like this and or you take both ADHD meds and anxiety meds, can you please share your experience on what works best for you daily and also for nighttime when you have those really bad an anxious physical symptoms and racing thoughts that puts you to sleep.

Thank you so much for anyone and everyone that’s made it this far. I love yall. ";r/adhd_anxiety;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ocibw3/needing_some_advice_on_adhd_anxiety/
2025-10-21 11:18:27;really really need advice, i feel like im in crisis;"i dont want sound too desperate but i feel like my life is completely off the rails

i (21f) was ""diagnosed"" with adhd by my therapist and psychiatrist when i was about 13, but when she told my mom i need a screening, my mom stopped taking me to therapy. saying they'd ""put me on meds"". well now i really really REALLY wish they did.

a background: that same year she pulled me from school and i quickly developed a drug habit, i did everything from smoke weed (still smoke daily) to doing coke in a hotel in another city when i was just 15 and heavily abusing xanax until i was about 18. of course, a lot of other really fucked things happened in the meantime, being that young hanging around adult addicts is never good. but i also meant the love of my life at that time, and she is the reason i realize i need to get better.

we have had fights throughout our relationship, she has grown so much to accomodate to me. and i have stagnated when it comes to returning that. i try so hard to work on the things she tells me i do that hurt her, but she says i just keep doing it. i never fully listen or comprehend when she tries to tell me things (serious or not), when others are around i blatantly ignore her and only listen to them, i devalue her feelings/discredit things she says, i act cold towards her when im preoccupied or my mind is preoccupied, refuse to admit when im wrong and i always always deflect and give excuses during arguments. i genuinely try so hard to listen, i try so hard to prioritize her the way she prioritizes me, but no matter what it feels like i always slip up and fall back into toxic patterns. she IS my world, i care about her more than everything and everyone. seriously id do immoral things if it meant shed be happy. i am so frustrated that i cant get over myself for her. 

on top of that my life and my house are completely unorganized, im considered posting on r/UnfuckMyHabitat . and i also feel like i cant afford therapy, im so behind on my phone and insurance bills.. i am in the process of getting a new job that will actually pay me enough to support myself, but in the mean time i just feel like everything is falling apart. 

i really want to be medicated, i feel like im trying so so hard and nothing changing.. any and all advice is so appreciated, even tough love. 

thank you so much for reading my rant 

tl:dr - my life and relationship are falling apart because i cabnot manage my adhd and also i have no money";r/ADHDers;6;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1oc27fj/really_really_need_advice_i_feel_like_im_in_crisis/

2025-10-20 15:30:03;Everything feels so incredibly difficult;23 y/o recently diagnosed ADHDer here. After I was diagnosed I was put on adderall briefly. Initially I felt amazing. My mood, motivation, energy, and focus were never better. That only lasted for about two days then I began to experience heart palpitations to the point where i needed to go to the ER because I thought i was having a heart attack. Doc took me off adderall and put me on vyvanse. Same thing happened. Initially felt great and then extreme anxiety and heart racing. Now we’re onto non-stimulants, but apparently I need to start taking Buspirone too because I have an underlying anxiety disorder. Okay. No problem. I start taking the Buspirone and I feel like im drunk every morning for 2-3 hours until it goes away. What the hell is wrong with my body? Why can’t I tolerate any medication without horrible side effects? I constantly think about how good I felt those first two days of adderall and long for that relief once again. I know there are non-stimulant options too but I’m so worried that nothing will help me and I’ll be forced to resign to a life of chronic brain fog and fatigue. Things have felt even harder than ever before recently. Every task at work, every lecture I must sit through, every page of the textbook I have to read… it feels agonizing. I can’t even focus long enough to play my favorite video games without taking a break every 5 minutes to doom scroll instagram reels or Reddit comment sections. I’m so happy I was diagnosed because it’s given a label to my suffering, but I can’t help but dread the possibility that nothing will help me. I know no one here is a doctor but I have no one else who will listen to me about this stuff besides my therapist, and I don’t see her until tomorrow. Godspeed to anyone out there dealing with this disorder, I don’t know how we do it. ;r/ADHDers;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1obdmae/everything_feels_so_incredibly_difficult/
2025-10-20 14:40:33;Executive dysfunction;"Hi guys,

So the situation is this. I’m diagnosed with anxiety but not ADHD. I’m going off Wellbutrin right now which is an antidepressant and an off label treatment for ADHD(gets more dopamine and norepinephrine in your synapses like adderall). Second day I decreased doses I couldn’t get out of bed to get dressed. I wanted to go to bed at midnight but it’s 3 am now and I’m lying in my floor sobbing because when I finally got the energy to go brush my teeth I couldn’t even turn the water on. I logically know how to turn the water on and I can feel myself trying to operate my body, but I feel like my body is a fussy toddler that doesn’t respond to anything I say or want to do. I have motivation to do everything but I can’t physically do anything. I’ve always been a little like this but it’s never been this bad in my adult life. I don’t self diagnose and I don’t expect any of you to diagnose me either, but does this sound like executive dysfunction?";r/adhd_anxiety;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1obcuay/executive_dysfunction/
2025-10-20 10:57:12;ADHD consultation made me wonder if I am just crazy;"Hello everyone,

This is the first post I am making on here, so I apologize if the formatting is not correct.

I recent had my first official consultation to see if I have ADHD. I was not nervous going into it, since I am almost 100% certain I have some form of it. I have been showing ADHD tendencies my whole life and one of my parents was diagnosed with a severe form of it. Recently, these tendencies have been affecting my personal relationships with friends and my spouse, which is why I decided to try and get diagnosed.

During the consultation, I felt like the questions were a bit open ended, which made it hard for me to answer the questions with blanket statements or examples. I felt like I was downplaying my symptoms. Maybe it was in an attempt to not seem too eager, like I was just doing this to get medication, I'm not sure. Even so, the doctor seemed to take my overexplaining and concerns of my symptoms as more of a behavioral issue, rather than connecting them to ADHD. I explained how I have the want to do things in my life that will greatly benefit it, but just can't do them; I explained how not many things give me dopamine and the things that DO give me dopamine, change (Motivation to start a project but seemingly out of nowhere I have no interest in it whatsoever, regardless of how much I was enjoying it) and how these symptoms do not happen EVERY SINGLE TIME, but often. There are many other symptoms I explained to them, but those were the main ones. The doctor seemed to just boil it down to behavioral issues or normal everyday issues EVERYONE deals with... They then suggested behavioral therapy and recommended me to a psychiatrist because they were on the fence about if I actually had ADHD.

The whole experience just made me feel as if my problems were just ""Normal people issues"", and that I am not handling them properly, rather than symptoms of ADHD. It also made my confidence in myself plummet and made me rethink my whole life... I can explain things further, as its hard for me to lay everything out here on one post, so feel free to ask follow up questions.

I just want to know if maybe I got a bad diagnosis, or if other people have had similar things happen to them and what they did to combat it.

Thank you!";r/adhd_anxiety;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ob8tnk/adhd_consultation_made_me_wonder_if_i_am_just/
2025-10-20 02:07:17;Looking for some guidance re: career;"Im not quite sure how to phrase this, so I apologize if this doesn't make much sense, but wanted to get this community’s opinion. I currently work for a pretty big name company in a role in cyber security. I’ve been in this general role type for about 10 years now and have been struggling the entire time, with intermittent periods of disability due to mental health, including a 2 year period during my last job. For context, I have ADHD (diagnosed only 3 years ago), cptsd, GAD, MDD, PMDD, and deal with chronic pain in my back. I don’t say that to complain—just sort of the reality of the situation. 

When I went back to work after disability, I went to work for my state, hoping for a bit more low key environment. Unfortunately, I couldn’t pay my bills as I live in a HCOL area (and not really an option to leave atm). I took this next “big” job with much hesitancy, but felt safe in the fact it was a very small, niche team, with a boss I really liked, and had some stipulations that helped me manage, like no “on-call” work. However, a few months in, there was a massive re-org, my team entirely changed, my boss changed, and everything about my role changed. Fast forward to today and I’m really struggling. With it all. Struggling with the work itself, understanding the role, the pressure, the stress, the anxiety. I severely dislike my boss and I dont think he likes me very much. All in all, it is now a really bad fit. I recognize that. 

Ultimately, I’ve realized that I need to scale back. I need a role that has less demands. I have long disliked what I want to do and get out of cyber security and tech, as it is a very poor fit with what I now recognize as all of the issues above, but I don’t know how to get out of it. I’ve been trying for years. I recognize everything has pros/cons, but I’d like a smaller company and something I can leave at the end of the day. I recognize I will make significantly less money. I’m hoping for a middle ground between where I couldn’t pay my bills and this. 

All that to say, how does one go about that? The reality is that I just can't maintain this level or this much visibility/demand and it is triggering my mental health. Despite my personal feelings, I seem written off as either not qualified or over-qualified for the roles I am interested in, let alone trying to pivot what I’m doing. At my core, I am a researcher and analyst and I feel like that can apply to a lot (even if it is my hope to leave that long term). 

Has anyone been able to sort of step back from their higher pressure/visible job? It is obviously an awful market and that also just absolutely adds to my stress and anxiety. I’m really struggling and don't want to go on leave again, as that ultimately doesn’t really solve anything.";r/adhd_anxiety;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1oawjym/looking_for_some_guidance_re_career/
2025-10-19 18:56:24;Strategies to leave the house (lack of interest/motivation + anxiety);"tldr: most days, I find it extremely hard to do my morning routine and get out of the house. I feel a heaviness on my chest and a generalised lack of care for any negative consequences (job loss, friend loss, etc). Please, tell me strategies and tricks that worked for you! 

I have been diagnosed with major chronic depression for almost 20 years now. Recently, as my depressive cycles were too short, I got diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly a lot of my moods and behaviours made much more sense. Still, I need help because I can't break out of this chronic pattern of not leaving my house... 

In detail...

Getting out of bed itself is hard but I found tricks that help and most of the time, I manage to move myself to the kitchen and make coffee, breakfast+take my meds (motivational trick, I am hungry and love coffee...). 

Then the problems start: if I don't feel well (chest heaviness, anhedonia), I cuddle up on the kitchen couch and never leave it. I don't care about the world or consequences. As so I cannot argue with myself about what's a ""good or bad behaviour"", trick myself into ""baby steps"" , listen to my boyfriend's pleas for me to move... 

Even if I feel ok, it's extremely hard to get dressed and ready to leave. I already reduced my commute from 1h to 35 min by driving an electric scooter to work, but still the thought of that mindless routine, spent on traffic, gives me a feeling like I'm going to throw up... 

If I manage to get out though, even if driving is boring, it's never as bad as I made it to be. Then, work is actually pleasurable most of the times and it's hard for me to leave at a decent time because 1) I'm into it (hyperfocus),  2) guilt for days missed/being late, 3) fear of the next day not being able to ""remember"" how I enjoy work, and 4) the boredom of the drive back. 

In the middle of all this, I'd like to incorporate enjoyable hobbies like swimming, sauna, friends, etc., but I don't have the time or energy after all the struggles with getting out of the house everyday. 
Fortunately, my boss is very understanding and I'm a good worker when I'm present; still, I'm on thin ice and might end up losing my job over this. 

Please, have you been through the same and what tricks got you out of it? Or anything that helped really...

2025-10-19 09:53:49;Last semester before my internship then graduation. It’s not looking good right now, but not completely irredeemable.;"Hi! I’m a fifth-year college student 22F with autism and ADHD amongst another slew of fun diagnoses (GAD, PMDD, C-PTSD, and MDD) and three sleep disorders (sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia).

I’m just going to be frank here: my accommodation’s office is absolutely ass at doing their job so I just took what I could get and communicated with my profs with the rest. They seem to be pretty tolerant of me turning things in late, thank god. Unfortunately, I still feel awful because my university grades us on a standard of “professionalism” which I sometimes fall short of and end up getting docked a grade or two for my final grade due to missing classes from oversleeping which is fair since attendance, being prepared, and showing up somewhere early are VERY IMPORTANT requirements for the job I will have (this was an issue that almost lost me my job too — my body does not let me decide when I wake up no matter what I do I kid you not and ever since I started using my CPAP it forces me to sleep 8 hours whether I want to or not which leaves me with like 2 hours to do anything when I come home from school and then I work beforehand and can’t move back in with my parents), I have one semester until I have a semester of an internship and then graduate…I hope.

I was a gifted and straight-A’s kid in K-12. It wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I started experiencing severe task paralysis and ended up having over 600 missing assignments total over the entirety of the 2020-21 school year. Thankfully, everything was online on a software that was completely asynchronous, and I had basically completed more of what an average senior would have my junior year, and it didn’t matter when my assignments were turned in, just that it was.

I brushed it off as just a bad year because of the obvious reason of what was happening in the word at the moment. Then, I started college that August.

Man, did I flop. I ended up getting formally diagnosed with ADHD and my psychiatrist telling me we could assess for it if I needed documentation but he was “pretty sure I was also autistic.” (Spoiler: I got diagnosed this January actually by someone completely different). Medication has always been an issue; whether it being that it doesn’t work or not having access to it (I’m taking 15mg Adderall and 112.5 mg of Effexor).

After my diagnosis and getting on medication, I started doing a little bit better but still struggling a ton. I figured out I was really sensitive to stimulants so I’m on a pretty low dose for an adult and that the non-stimulant options gave me burning stress-hives all over my body. I still had to struggle a lot to get even a B, and feel bad for how little I felt I have truly learned throughout my degree because I have had to cut corners and turn in less than ideal quality of work to keep myself from breaking down nightly (I mean, it doesn’t really work). What I’m currently studying is so important to me so it hurts so much that I can’t find it in me to start. I think about how long I have to work and how much I have to do and if it’s even possible to do everything and just start sobbing. 

Learning techniques to help myself is also something I have been fascinated by and I feel like I have tried everything out there to help myself at this point that I could think of, find in the internet, or that people bring up (and yes, for extended periods of time). I have expressed this to everyone around me and that I feel like a failure and that it makes me look horrible to people I deeply respect and care about.

In class, I feel like the one dragging people behind or the annoying one to be partnered with in discussions because no I didn’t do the reading and if I did I know I could contribute so much. I’m already graduating later than I was supposed to due to failing many courses and also just having a long-ass degree. I told my family they could look forward to me graduating this semester and they are putting a lot of pressure on me to be done by May and making me feel like a lazy POS for feeling like I can’t do anything and I honestly feel like it too. I want to be done with this Bachelor’s degree so fucking badly.

I have dug myself a hole here…again. Usually every semester starts off semi-strong and then I MAJORLY tank when it starts to ramp up. I have been sick a total of 12 times this year and one was this fall and it was the most recent time. I was out of school and work for an entire week and I got behind and everything just snowballed and I now have like 20-40 missing assignments that are big chunks of my grade and long projects I can’t afford to not do and I’m in 18 credits because I was told by others in my class with ADHD that they were low effort and so I’m now p a n i c k i n g. 

When I am able to focus and actually do work, it’s not super reproducible. There isn’t one single thing I can think of that gives me extra motivation or energy or makes me feel better or whatever and then I’m productive. 

I just feel like I’m broken. Like nobody can help me. I have seen psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, sleep doctors, executive functioning coaches through the accommodations office, talked to peers, had blood work done, etc. and I still don’t know what is so wrong with me nor do I have the tools to help myself and so I just keep going like the best I can because I am trying to fight feeling like I’m broken because I know that attitude won’t be helpful for me and if this semester is still redeemable that I should continue. I thought the issue was my sleep but it looks like it wasn’t that. My diet isn’t the greatest and I don’t exercise a lot because with how stressed I am I can’t really afford either in the ways needed. I’m disappointing myself over and over again. I have kids depending on me to do my assignments at my fieldwork experiences which puts more pressure on me and when I’m finally regulated I just pass out and fall asleep. I barely have the energy in my body to stay upright sometimes and even walking sometimes is a lot on me now and it’s frustrating because it feels like everyone around me doesn’t have it easy but that it’s easy enough for them to do things and if they were in my situation minus the diagnoses they could get things done without a problem. 

This is a problem throughout my life with everything that requires task initiation and sustained attention. I feel like I can’t get anything done other than the once in a while spurt of productivity where my body decides it wants to function now. Not able to do chores so there’s been a lot of mold unfortunately, and barely just getting to school and work. I’m living off of my current convenient safe foods because I don’t even have the energy to make mac and cheese or something: just hot pockets, uncrustables, and cosmic brownies which is not super great for my GERD and I’m coughing all the time from heartburn setting my throat on fire. All I have the capacity for at the moment are dumbass mobile app games and watching YouTube and twitch streams and it’s terrible for me but I can’t seem to stop. Even when I have uninstalled them for months in the past, it hasn’t seemed to improve things much and it is still difficult to do anything, like I distract myself?

I am SO CLOSE to being done! I just want to be done and I don’t want to give up. Any suggestions? Anyone been here before?

I hope it’s not inappropriate.



**PROLOGUE**  
ADHD is a condition whose effects are, let’s be honest, very Instagrammable, very funny: how hilarious is it to watch the video of an ADHD guy who can’t even fill his glass of water because he’s distracted by a thousand things? AHAHA, pure laughs.

But we’re talking about real people here, especially those diagnosed as adults, who have spent their lives being bullied by a society that forgives nothing—a society that made perfection (which doesn’t exist) the universal standard, and that boosts itself by kicking those already down just to feel superior and walk into church more serenely. ADHD is a biological condition, a different way the brain works; it’s not something you “cure,” it’s something you learn to **manage** (if you have it) and **accept** (if you don’t). Often, it also becomes a psychological burden, and no kidding: try living your life being constantly told, “You’re lazy, you can’t do anything, where were you when God was handing out intelligence?” (I could go on, but why burn material for a great article coming soon?)

So today, friends, we reveal the dark side of ADHD. Today, we lift the curtain to peek behind the laughs ADHD people make us have (before we, of course, consider kicking them—just kidding).



**ACT I: TIME BLINDNESS**  
*""Time is relative; its only worth depends on what we do while it passes.""* – Albert Einstein

To explain this, here’s an example: you boil water for pasta. While it heats, you go hang the laundry. You come back, and it’s still not boiling. You sit on the couch and scroll through social media. You check again, and all the water has evaporated. People with ADHD often have an **objective difficulty perceiving the passage of time**: hours feel like minutes, and minutes feel endless.

And it scales up: years pass before you call that old friend you care about, only for them to scold you: “Really? After all this time?”

Imagine the frustration, the practical difficulties of planning a day for someone who **biologically lives in the present** and doesn’t sense time passing. Imagine the relational challenges. And imagine how hard it is to live this without understanding why (I’m talking about those undiagnosed, experiencing a double blindness: temporal and explanatory). Manageable? Yes. Pleasant? No.

*Offstage:* experts call this **time blindness**—difficulty perceiving the flow of time. It’s like living in your own time zone, never matching the rest of the world.

**ACT II: OBSESSION WITH THE WRONG DETAIL**  
Classic ADHD: I write and spend hours choosing the right font. I’ve never been good at knowing which font is “right” (maybe because my cursive handwriting is unreadable, but don’t ask me why). After hours of hyperfocus, I pick a font, apply it, and… forget to send the email. I’m sure my fellow ADHD readers can come up with a thousand similar examples.

*Offstage:* this happens because ADHD drives hyperfocus on irrelevant details. The mind seeks interesting stimuli and ignores priorities. Result: the background becomes the protagonist, and the main plot is left incomplete.

**ACT III: EVAPORATED CONVERSATIONS**  
This one hits relational skills hard. The ADHD brain never shuts off, and while conversing, lateral thoughts often (always) take over, making us lose the thread. I tell a story, and halfway through I switch to another one about how adorable penguins are when they walk. Listeners understand nothing, and neither do I. Worse still is the opposite: that cursed impulsivity, that urge to interrupt, because thoughts **must** be spoken—even if trivial—while someone is telling you something important. They talk about their pain, and you start fixing a leaking faucet in the middle of it. If that’s not a tragedy, I don’t know what is.

*Offstage:* this is called **losing the thread of conversation**. ADHD minds jump from association to association at supersonic speed. It’s creative, yes, but sometimes it feels like speaking in secret languages only you can decipher.

**ACT IV: SELECTIVE MOTIVATION**  
ADHD isn’t about laziness; it’s almost the opposite. Our actions are guided by a constant search for stimuli that release some dopamine. Everyday life often lacks these motivators, making even sending an email an epic task. But when we find something exciting, a novelty? Hyperfocus kicks in, and we have to chase it until it fades. Writing a simple email is hard; staying up all night on a passion project is effortless.

*Offstage:* this is called **selective motivation**. ADHD is not laziness: it works perfectly… it just chooses what to motivate itself for. Real-life priorities often fall outside the script.

**ACT V: REMINDERS SABOTAGED**  
Managing ADHD means designing strategies to survive in a neurotypical world. Forget things? Fine, set reminders! Post-its, phone alarms, grandma calling… I’ve tried them all, together.

Yet the ADHD brain is a master saboteur: it ignores all reminders… only to do the task hours later in a genius, last-minute way.

*Offstage:* reminders often aren’t enough. It’s not voluntary distraction; the signal doesn’t automatically translate into action. Sometimes, you need something more dramatic… like a nuclear alarm siren.

**ACT VI: ENERGY OUT OF TIME**  
Motivation hits at the worst times—like at night. We spend the day wandering around, bored, and then, when the world sleeps: *“Now it’s time to be productive!”* Change the season, start that novel from ’86, brilliant ideas strike!

*Offstage:* this is the classic **ADHD nighttime creative spike**. The mind shines when life demands silence and rest. Powerful, but inconvenient.

**ACT VII: THE INVISIBLE WEIGHT OF JUDGMENTS**  
Here ADHD, a biological condition, often becomes a psychiatric burden. ADHD is genetic, a way of being—like being blond. The brain works differently, hard for most people to understand. And it’s worse when surrounded by those who shape your life: parents, teachers, classmates.

Even today, in 2025, parents tell me their ADHD-diagnosed kids are treated like outcasts. For me, the late diagnosis allowed me to **forgive myself** for being different from my parents’ expectations. Guilt shaped choices in a toxic environment where intelligence and extreme emotional fragility were ignored—or exploited.

*Offstage:* everyone talks about “laziness” or “inability to organize,” but few see how ADHD minds really work. The brain jumps between stimuli and priorities; strategies aren’t always visible. These judgments stick like heavy curtains, but behind them is a stage full of creativity, intuition, and talent unnoticed.

**EPILOGUE**  
And so the curtain falls on my ADHD existence, among minor catastrophes, sudden insights, and crushing judgments. But guess what? I’m not alone. Maybe you recognize yourself in some act, some small disaster.

Here’s the challenge: **share your daily tragedy**—even a tiny ironic act or honest thought. Let’s turn this into a shared stage, where laughing at ourselves becomes easier, and realizing we’re not alone is possible.

*Offstage:* true power lies in sharing. Telling our daily battles with humor and honesty is the first step to turning chaos into connection.";r/ADHDers;61;15;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1oa2jbk/im_50_and_just_got_diagnosed_with_adhd_here_are/
2025-10-18 08:11:24;Messed up timing and made my best friend miss birthday concert;"My best friend’s birthday was a couple weeks ago, I got her tickets to a concert for an artist we both like in San Francisco. It was on a Thursday night and we live about 3 hours from SF. We are in a very intense major in college, and had to leave our classes early to go, and come back early this morning to make it to our Friday classes. I knew going into it that the situation would be kind of stressful but I thought it would be worth it, and we can stay with my sister for free in the city. I mixed up the time and thought that the doors were when the concert started, I also figured there would be an opener, but it was just an hour set, and I didn’t account for traffic enough. By time we got to SF the concert was over. 

I really meant to check all of these details and plan everything better, but I had a test and so much work due this week it all got away from me. I also wanted to stay for as much of my class on thursday as possible and didn’t leave early enough. Typically my other friends do most of the planning when we do outings/trips like this, but because this was my gift to her I had all the details and she just assumed I had it all figured out out. She’s been nice about the whole thing and we still did make the best of the night getting dinner and drinks in the city, but I can tell that she’s upset about it (rightfully so). 

Time and planning are some of my biggest struggles, I’m notoriously late and spend too long doing things, and I’m kicking myself cause this definitely could have been avoided. I told her I’d make it up to her and we looked at going to some other concerts soon but SF is the closest city to us and if doesn’t look like anything’s gonna work out in the near future.  Also I ate the cost of the tickets and buying more for something else would be expensive. I feel really bad and now we both are pretty exhausted but still have so much work to do this weekend (grind never stops)(don’t go to architecture school lol). She also has anxiety and was stressed about going to begin with. I just really feel like I fucked up. 

For context I was diagnosed officially a little over a year ago and tried about every med under the sun, but they all totally fucked up my mental health. I’ve been off of any medication so far this school year and it’s actually been okay grade wise but I do just feel like school takes up so much of my mental space right now. The situation feels like a microcosm of me being so overwhelmed in college and not being able to do anything fun or focus on other things. My program is time consuming AF. I’m super passionate about what I’m doing but I’m basically in grad school as a 20 yr old who is learning how to manage pretty bad ADHD. idk how I’m functioning or how i got here honestly. 

Anyways, I seriously let her down and it’s one of the first times my ADHD issues have really impacted someone else, not just me. I know it’ll all be a funny story soon, but my brain is really blowing it out of proportion right now and I think she’s really mad at me. Does anyone have any similar stories? any advice on how to make it up to her without breaking the bank would also be much appreciated!

2025-10-18 01:11:48;Vyvanse Anxiety;"Advice and support needed please. Recently late diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve always been an anxious person. I have just started vyvanse. 
Did 3 days on 20mg. Day 1 was ok, some improvement in symptoms. Day 2 felt a bit very flustered and easily distracted. Day 3 was so bad I was not functional (spinning around unable to start anything) and very anxious and flustered by the afternoon. I suspected the dose was too low. 
Forgot to take it for 2 days 💀
Realised I forgot to take it and upped the dose to 30mg at 8am because 20mg was unbearable. Definite improvement in focus during the day. I was so hopeful but that evening - insomnia worsened, headache and realised lack of appetite until about midnight. Insomnia and lack of appetite I can live with. But I’m on day 3 of 30mg and the anxiety is horrendous. Disclaimer here: I have a super stressful job in the veterinary field and I had a particularly awful case yesterday. But I feel this is worse than my normal anxiety. Overthinking obsessively, crying, panicky and paranoid. 
TLDR 
1) Please tell me the anxiety and insomnia get better after a few days 
2) Any tips on differentiating between too high and too low and just transient side effects??
3) Any tips to help with the anxiety? I’m trying to practice compassion and calming techniques but I’m struggling

2025-10-17 22:26:55;Tyvanse not working, advice needed :(;"26 year old guy recently diagnosed with ADHD and Autism (autism is mild, ADHD is moderate to higher)

I’ve been on Tyvanse since July, slowly moving up to 50MG daily. At first the benefits were fantastic - I felt clearer, able to concentrate and more functional - but all these benefits have basically left since August. Despite moving to the higher 50MG dose (began at 20)

I’m just trying to figure out what this could mean. I assume it means my ADHD is at a higher level and needs more medication, but I’m also worried if it didn’t work maybe I somehow don’t have ADHD?

2025-10-17 09:44:36;Still struggling to feel normal even after months of ADHD treatment — what’s going on?;"Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with something that’s really confusing me, and I’d love some insight from people who’ve been through something similar.

I was diagnosed with ADHD a while back, mainly because I had trouble focusing, staying motivated, and finishing work. The first effective medication I was put on was Concerta 54 mg, and honestly, it worked — at least on the surface. My focus was sharp, I could get things done, and I felt “on” again. But it came with side effects: I felt euphoric, couldn’t sleep well, and lost my appetite completely.

Eventually, I stopped that dose, and ever since then, I’ve kind of crashed. Even after being off medication for months, I started to feel sluggish, low energy, dopamine-depleted, socially off, unfocused, and just physically drained. It’s like my body and brain can’t get into gear. I got bloodwork done, and everything came back normal, which just made things more confusing.

I tried Strattera for about two months, and while it helped a bit with focus, it made me feel heavy, sluggish, and mentally dulled — like my brain was wrapped in cotton. I’m now on Concerta 27 mg, and it’s… okay, but not great. Early in the morning, I can get some work done, but my hunger is really high, my brain feels scattered, and the crash later in the day is rough. It doesn’t feel like it’s actually helping my focus in a consistent or meaningful way.

My psychiatrist isn’t super proactive; when I explain all this, she just says, “So what do you want to do?” — which is frustrating because I don’t know what’s best. I’m not the expert here; I’m just trying to feel normal again.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
	•	Is it normal to still feel this drained and foggy after months of trying different ADHD meds?
	•	Could I have been misdiagnosed, or is this what ADHD feels like when it’s under-treated?
	•	Why do I feel worse off medication than I did before ever starting treatment?

At this point, I just want to feel clear-headed and functional again — not overstimulated, not numb, just normal. I’m wondering if others have gone through something similar or if there’s something else I might be missing here.";r/ADHDers;6;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1o8olm6/still_struggling_to_feel_normal_even_after_months/
2025-10-16 13:42:53;i dont really know what to do most days and i wake up and it feels like time is continuous;"hello, sorry for the rant. kinda more of an i dont know what to do with myself.

im a senior in high scool and i really don't know how to get out of this rut or something similar to that. i have work to do and late assignments but i just don't seem to care enough to do them? well, i care about them a lot of course, but i just can't open the binder or read a page. it's always in front of my mind but i don't really act on them for some reason.   
  
i mean, i can do other stuff i like, such as writing code for what, 13 hours straight on the weekends? that's really the only thing that interests me as of late. games i used to play seem boring, childish almost. i dont really have any friends to speak of either in real life or online. there's sometimes a day or two that i genuinely don't speak to anyone, or have a real conversation with. i talk to my parents, sure, but its mostly, ""is school going well?"", ""yeah.. it's fine.."" or ""is dinner good?"", ""i mean.. yeah..it's good.."" 

i have been diagnosed with depression, but that was a year ago maybe. i stopped going to the psychiatrist 6 months ago since i just didn't like the endless questionnaire and checkups where its just like, ""so (name) how have you been feeling?.. ""fine""... do you think we need to increase your dosage? ""not really..."". that is the most i can remember from going there. maybe im just paranoid or something but it felt like they were there just to sell medication and not really care, or maybe im just bad at communication. maybe both. psychiatry is a business after all and life is just a long chain of exchanges.    
  
ive tried a lot to work but it doesn't seem to work. pomodoro, cutting down distractions, etc. i don't even carry a smartphone anymore like, im using a flip phone and its fine for me. yet i still find myself not being able to ""just focus"" and my sleep schedule is still terrible. i go to sleep at 5pm, wake up at 11pm, try to work from 12 to 3am, and just go back to bed until i begrudgingly have to wake up at 7am for school. 

is there anything i can do? like small habits or reminders?

What I would like to know is whether for you it seems logical or not. I am French and I have already had opinions from French people but I wonder if elsewhere it happens like this in France. Some say that it is extremely dangerous and not at all logical since in certain people with ADHD the treatment does not take effect and therefore it made no sense.

2025-10-15 22:47:53;One month, one week, one day at a time;"In the past 18 months I have made more efforts to understand myself and my experiences having ADHD. I received my diagnosis when I was 7 years old and then again at 18 as an adult with disabilities. I. The late 80’s and early 90’s there wasn’t as much awareness, but I appreciate the teachers I had for special needs that taught me how to regulate.

Now I am 43, married with kids and a metric ton of responsibilities at work and at home, it’s all been very overwhelming. My spouse has always been aware of my personal flavor of ADHD but I’m not so sure I ever knew enough about myself to explain things.

18 months ago I restarted medication - non stimulant this time - after a 19 years absence. I have also been working with several therapist this year and last week I started listening to an audio book titled “Men with ADHD”.

I have been feeling really good about myself and my daily mental state is much better. Most of the therapy involves CBT methods and this audio book applies the same approach.

I still have problems with my negative thoughts, but it’s getting better since I’ve been using a positive affirmation and challenging those negative thoughts with logic and questions.

Stimulants or nonstimulants? I think I consider my ADHD to be part of my personality at this point, so that might play into it as well.

I was diagnosed a few years ago at the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I’m not on ADHD meds yet because they can trigger mania and my mood is not stable enough right now now.

2025-10-14 23:35:49;Frustration with the way parts of the ADHD convo erase nuance;"I’m not going to name subs or users, but you’ve probably seen the thread calling ADHD “self sabotage disorder,” and the chorus underneath saying people with “milder” symptoms shouldn’t call it ADHD because it supposedly dilutes the “real” struggle. What are we doing. Why do we keep punching sideways at each other when the whole point is that ADHD isn’t one uniform experience.

I’m tired of the false choices. Either perform misery at all times or you’re faking it. Either say “ADHD is a gift” or you’re catastrophizing. Both takes are ableist in different outfits. The truth is messy. Symptom intensity changes with sleep, hormones, meds, support, context. Two people can have the same diagnosis and wildly different daily realities. That doesn’t make one of them counterfeit.

Also, the language matters. Slapping “self sabotage” on a neurodevelopmental condition isn’t edgy, it’s shaming. Plenty of us already walk around with a backlog of guilt and “why can’t I just try harder.” We don’t need branding that turns executive dysfunction into a moral failure, and if you want something gentler I saw a small prompt where you can share one real ADHD moment and the tiny thing that helped so people can borrow scripts that actually work, I’m posting mine there for ideas on boundary language if that helps too https://chat.whatsapp.com/BSd4ZMUNfPNEF8w6cLm4dR?mode=wwt

2025-10-14 16:13:57;Telling me I'll be fine.;"How do I approach this? 

Manager is clearly not taking my diagnosis seriously. I was so excited about my diagnosis and finally have the chance to dial back on my 'work persona' and stop expending all my energy pretending to be something I'm not.

He still hasn't completed a workplace adjustment meeting 3 weeks later, which the higher ups inform me should have been done in the first two weeks after diagnosis, ideally in the first week.

One of my issues is being unable to advocate for myself. I can verbalise what I want and need to my trusted people, but I falter when it comes to being assertive to my manager.

Interaction by text on Friday went like this...

*Me: What's the plan for Saturday? I don't want to come into chaos and end up getting stressed out because there's no cover.*

*Him: Colleague & colleague off, but colleague on till 8. The locum is Pharmacist so you’ll be fine 👍🏻*

I'm guessing he still hasn't read any of the advice sheets he was given, because he'd know that putting me in these situations isn't great. I think he's just expecting me to get on with it really, which I want to, just with a few changes. Maybe I didn't use the right words, questions or statements.

And during this interaction, he had the opportunity to inform me that the shift I worked on Friday was going to be the same, but he didn't and I had to find out about it while I was already in work. So I was already stuck there, stressed out, no plan, no prep.

I snitched on him to the higher-ups, which made me feel underhanded and sneaky, but I've given him ample time and opportunity to start making changes. What else can I do to advocate for myself and also get him to take this seriously?

Saturday was awful, it was just me, one counter staff and a pharmacist. I'm a trainee pharmacy tech, and on a Saturday I'm usually the only dispenser, but I normally have more counter staff in to delegate tasks to. However, when it's just me and one other, everything has to run through me, I can't wear my headphones because I need to be available and I'm the one who has to make sure all the tasks are completed.

I had Sunday off, but it was not enough time to recover. 

Straight into Monday where I find out were short staffed again. I'm making it through the shift to find out that we're gonna be short staffed again today, except tonight, it'll be me and two pharmacists, so I'll be expected to run back and forth on the counter. I won't be able to wear headphones and it'll be really difficult to take mental breaks.

I expressed my concerns and again I get told, ""you'll be fine"". Except I know I won't be, I'll make it through the shift sure, but I'll be so drained that my day off tomorrow will be spent trying to recover. 

The more drained I am, the more the difficulties start to bleed through to my home life and my coursework.

I'm already behind on my course and I'm the one chasing my manager for work that he needs to complete with me.

2025-10-13 20:17:15;I had to share this, even though it looks like self-promotion...;"Super long but this feels like a win...

So, I created this framework to help diagnose why I don't do what I know I need to: PGQ. Which at its core is represented by this equation:

>Personal Outcomes = You x Action x Environment x Circumstances

The premise is that we are getting the outcomes we are supposed to get based on our current equation and if we want different outcomes, we have to change the equation.

Basically, diagnostic, it will tell me why but not how, although by telling me why at a micro-level, I can determine what and how naturally.

Anyway, I have ADHD and it's been, well 9 months, since I started creating this framework and setting up my business and all of that but zero revenue and I have been feeling like an imposter. I mean, I live in my head and I have a list of symptoms that make it hard to focus, to start, to complete, etc. Execution is my weak area (Action, from above), well, so is Environment. Well, I have weak parts in all of those variables.

So, recently I started trying to understand how my ADHD fit into PGQ and I started coming up with tools to help me execute: to help me decide, to help me prioritize, to help me build discipline, and so on.

Fast forward to today, I just finished my first offer, an ADHD-enhanced Eisenhower Matrix to help people with ADHD with decision paralysis and prioritization; the original matrix uses important vs urgent, but to an ADHDer, something can be important and urgent and we still won't do it. I enhanced the original to deal with this bottleneck.

It's live as of last night and now I am in my next bottleneck, going from 0 to first sale. I have ChatGPT and I created a project with most of my PGQ assets uploaded as the knowledge base.

**My prompt:**

    How do I know what my problem is? I am a solo adhd entrepreneur with many persistent identities. I create PGQ to help me figure out why i dont do what i say i will and to execute. but now i feel like an imposter because it feels like its not working for me. i have created my first product and its live. and I am stuck, possibly inertia or maybe its just my mind or my inability to initiate, fear of failure, desire to continue to plan and talk with chatgpt instead of executing. i need to get to my first sale, my intention, but how do i bridge the intention-action gap to execute?

Keep in mind my full context is that I have been chatting with ChatGPT for a while now and so while this is what you see, there's obviously more nuance to it.

**The response**:

Let’s diagnose this the PGQ way (You × Action × Environment × Circumstances).  
We’ll walk through the evidence so you can see exactly why I frame your core problem as an execution bottleneck caused by a system-level gap, not a personal failure.

# 🧩 Step 1. Evidence Gathering — What We Actually Know

|PGQ Factor|Observable Data (from your words)|Interpretation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**You (internal variables)**|• ADHD + multiple persistent identities • Awareness of patterns (intention–action gap) • Imposter feelings • Preference for ideation, planning, system design, reflection|You have *high metacognition* but *low activation energy.* You see the whole map but can’t always start walking. Classic ADHD executive friction — intention ≠ initiation.|
|**Action (behaviors + systems)**|• Product is finished and live • Still “stuck” before promotion • Engages in extended planning/talking cycles instead of outward actions (posting, DMing, outreach)|This shows a **break at the “initiation” node** — the move from thinking → doing. That’s the Action variable approaching zero.|
|**Environment (cues + supports)**|• Working alone • No co-founder / accountability • Heavy cognitive load managing multiple roles • No external trigger loops yet (content→DM→checkout)|Low scaffolding, few external cues. The environment doesn’t yet “pull” you into motion; you must self-initiate every step, which is costly for an ADHD brain.|
|**Circumstances (real-world context)**|• Solo founder, single mom, limited capacity, fear of failure, high standards • Early business stage (0→1) • No cash buffer or team|High cognitive/emotional load → depleted energy → fragile consistency. Circumstances add friction to both Action and You.|



# 🧮 Step 2. The PGQ Equation in Practice

**Outcome = You × Action × Environment × Circumstances**

Your outcome (first sale) is currently **≈ 0**, but not because all variables are bad.  
One variable at near-zero makes the whole product near-zero.

|Variable|Rough status|Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**You**|high awareness, moderate self-belief, but low regulation|✳️ oscillating|
|**Action**|low initiation, inconsistent execution, no loop closure|❌ near zero|
|**Environment**|minimal cues, no accountability or automation|❌ low|
|**Circumstances**|constrained, but not immovable|⚠️ moderate frictio|

# 🧠 Step 3. The Real Problem Statement (Evidence-Based)

>

This is not laziness, fear, or failure — it’s a mismatch between how your brain initiates and how your environment demands initiation.

# ⚡ Step 4. The Goal (Defined from Evidence)

Goal:  
Increase the effective value of the Action variable (and slightly of Environment) to create observable movement toward your first sale within a contained experiment — ideally within 14 days.

That means:

* Create one frictionless activation ritual (a cue that starts your “sales mode”).
* Add externalized scaffolding (prompts, structure, accountability).
* Reduce cognitive complexity to one repeatable micro-pipeline.
* Protect self-trust by measuring action completed, not outcome achieved.

The evidence says your Action variable is the lowest, dragged down by Environment and amplified by Circumstances.  
PGQ is working — it’s showing you the precise gap: Execution Friction (A↓, E↓).  


# 🚧 Step 5. The Intention–Action Gap (Why It Feels Like PGQ “Isn’t Working”)

You’ve built the **diagnostic model (PGQ)** but not the **execution protocol** (what happens after diagnosis).  
PGQ showed you *why* you’re not acting — but you haven’t yet designed the *bridge behavior.*

That’s like building a medical scanner and saying, “It shows a broken bone — why isn’t it healing me?”  
It’s not supposed to; it tells you *where* to apply the cast.

# 🪞 Step 6. What the Evidence Doesn’t Say

It doesn’t say:

* You lack discipline or talent.
* PGQ is invalid.
* ADHD makes success impossible.

It says:

* The **bridge layer** (execution protocol) hasn’t been implemented.
* Your **system doesn’t yet contain leverage** — only awareness.
* You’re running on cognitive, not structural, effort — which collapses under load.

If you’re ready, our **next step** is to *design that bridge* —  
the behavioral scaffolding that turns PGQ from an insight framework into a **working action engine**.

That bridge will have:

1. A **cue** (start ritual / trigger).
2. A **scripted micro-behavior** (pre-written small step).
3. A **closed feedback loop** (external data, accountability, or reward).

Would you like me to walk you through designing that *PGQ Execution Bridge* — using your ADHD-specific needs and your live product as the test case?

Suffice it to say that I was honestly blown away by how ChatGPT used my framework on me, and I feel truly hopeful, that:

1. I will figure out my intention-action gap bridge and be able to execute, despite my ADHD.
2. The possibilities are endless with this (and that can actually be a problem with my ADHD, lol)";r/ADHDers;0;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1o5i31h/i_had_to_share_this_even_though_it_looks_like/
2025-10-13 02:21:46;Anyone else felt like they didn’t receive enough support as a child in hindsight?;"
All I remember was that school was a very unpleasant experience for me. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was probably deeply anxious and scared everyday. I had a reputation of being mute. I didn’t talk to anyone or the teachers, only to my parents when I got home and even then I didn’t say much. 

I didn’t absorb anything the teacher taught. I would forget it immediately. I could try paying attention, and the most I could do was focus for a few minutes before I would go back into my own imaginary world. 
Since I was really quiet and didn’t interrupt class, I  didn’t stand out compared to the loud and disruptive ones. I would literally just daydream the entire day.

I failed all my classes, felt like I was punished constantly by every adult, and how I perceived back then it was “why is every adult being mean to me.” Most of my memories of school were just waiting an agonizingly long time for it to end every day. 

I think a few teachers talked to my parents. I remember getting multiple assessments and going to several psychologists but nothing ever came out of it. My parents didn’t believe in medications or psychiatric diagnosis or anything, so I think they sent me to go for these assessments by specialists to save face. 

 I turned my life around as an adult and got straight As in college studying something academically challenging. It was just less stressful when I could study and learn by myself, without all the external negative feedback. I also became very extroverted and travel a lot.

Registering it all now and my reaction to it is: WTF was all that about? 😑 and why am I just realizing all this now that I’m going to approach my 30s??

2025-10-12 00:38:14;How to Know If They Really Like You or are Just Hyperfocused;"I’m AuDHD (combined type), also with PTSD and MDD; medicated for all (except the autism, I suppose). I’m newly involved with someone who, while he doesn’t have a formal ADHD diagnosis, his daughter does, and after just a couple of weeks of talking to him, I’m positive that’s where she gets it from (and he’s the hyperactive type, btw—he has to be). He is unmedicated and is warming up to the idea of counseling. 

My question is this: I hear very frequently that people with ADHD tend to hyperfixate on a new love interest while we’re still ‘shiny,’ but then they will suddenly lose interest. I’ve done this myself, but since my own psychological makeup is different than his, I wanted to seek outside opinions: how do you know if they’re just hyperfixated/limerent for you, or if they’re really in it for the long haul, should things really work out that way? I’ve read one very insightful comment somewhere about relationships based on dopamine vs ones based on oxytocin, for example. All insight is welcome and appreciated.

This I think relates to adhd? I think this is caused by it but I’m not 100% certain about that fact. 

I’ve never been able to start things, ever, because all my life I’ve believed that my failure defines me. its so hard to take a step back and allow myself to make mistakes, especially when I feel compared to everyone else. it’s to the point I don’t try anymore, on top of that, with the age I am, I feel everyone’s disappointment bubbling up more and more. The more time that passes, the more I look back on things and think that I could have already known how to do that if I had just tried for fifteen minutes a day. Animating, guitar, Spanish, all these things that I’ve wanted to do since I was seventeen. And now I’m a bumbling eighteen year old. No job, a borderline-disabling eye condition, still in school despite being able to graduate last year, no partner, hardly any friends after some situations that happened.

it feels like my whole life is crumbling apart and I’m desperately trying to hold on to the sand. 

Every time I start to try to learn something, I’m immediately reaching for the best, and of course that leads to failure and me giving up. Every single time. I’ve lost so much time to this stupid block in my brain. i don’t even know if it’s just adhd, regardless I’m not allowed to get on medication (not medically diagnosed yet, too broke to go get a diagnosis plus meds are expensive and my doctor refuses to prescribe them because I should ‘try learning how to manage it first without them, then if that doesn’t work I can take them’) 

i just don’t know how to get motivation, I don‘t know how to be comfortable failing. I’m rotting away every single day, and this is a million times worse than failing. i get in these mini moods and episodes of feeling like I can finally fix it, I’ll work out, look for jobs in my local area, practice a bit of guitar, animate a bit, but the very next morning it feels like I hit this extreme numbness. By brain fog is the worst its ever been in my whole life, I can’t do anything anymore. I’m so scared that I’ve messed up, I’m so scared that I’ll never get it together and that its all over for me before I even got to start. Everyday I just want to die more and more, my therapist isn’t helping because she’s fresh out of college and doesn’t quite follow me. I’m too self aware, but not in the way where I know how to fix things. I’ve never had my life set up easy, my cards aren’t great, but I’m absolutely not doing the best that I can with what I have. Its awful, knowing my parents have to see their daughter be such a failure. I can‘t keep hoping it will get better, I have to do something before I die from this. please help me.";r/ADHDers;6;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1o3s3q5/i_dont_know_how_to_meet_myself_where_im_at_and_i/
2025-10-11 12:20:17;frustrated about being unable to keep any hobbies;"
every single person i know has a hobby of some sort.

they are good at it, it brings them joy and happiness and they try and try and get real benefit and enjoyment out of doing it.

i was diagnosed recently and it definitely makes sense. the hobby graveyard is real. 

i feel so genuinely awful, boring, uninteresting. i have tried,, and tried, and tried so many hobbies. SO many. i just want that sense of progressing, being proud of myself and creating things, getting ideas and just having something i enjoy.

i am a teen. i come home after school and all i can do is crash on my bed and watch youtube, twitch, go on pinterest, whatever. its all i want to do. i get home and eat and then do nothing with myself. i am so frustrated. im on meds for both adhd and anxiety and ive noticed improvements but still.. the hobby thing just gets to me.

last weekend i was enjoying painting. now i look at the painting i started and was proud of and i feel hollow and have no motivation. cycling? no motivation. 

does anyone have ANY tips as to how i can beat this stupid condition? in this aspect at least.
i feel so hopeless. i just want a hobby. i love journalling and notebooks and i want to do it today but its a brick wall that i dont have the strength to climb over.

my meds have helped in school lots, i find it easier to focus. but its just rough. my SAD makes it impossible to join any groups or sports clubs or anything of the sort.

any tips at all. thank you all so much. i apologise for my rant, im just so frustrated with myself and my brain when all my peers are easily able to maintain and enjoy their hobbies even when its hard.



tl;dr hobbies are hard. i feel uninteresting and boring and all those around me maintain their hobbies and get lots out of them while i cant keep a hobby. ive tried and tried. meds arent helping with that aspect. 

looking for any tips or advice or similar experiences, stories etc. thank you.";r/adhd_anxiety;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1o3m6te/frustrated_about_being_unable_to_keep_any_hobbies/
2025-10-11 11:53:38;ADHD Seeking Help;"Hey everyone. I have both PTSD and ADHD. I've lost my entire family and I'm only 29 years old.

(Very sorry if this is a bit intense, genuinely, but unfortunately it's my life) I'm fine and have never been happier. I've had over probably 500 hours of counselling and psychology which has helped me immensely.

My father hanged himself in my backyard when I was 12. I found him and had to pull him up by the rope. My brother was 3 years older than me and had to take on the father responsibilities at such a young age, which he couldn't cope with. He took his life when I was 17. 

My mum was diagnosed with early onset dementia when I was 14 at the age of 46, the doctors think it was from all the stress. I cared for her for 13 years having to leave school early and everything.

I done everything for her, from showering her, dressing her, spoon feeding her, keeping an eye on her GPS tracker so she wouldn't go walkabouts and get lost - not know who she was, how to talk, where she was etc. She passed away a couple of years ago now.

My question is for ADHD. My ADHD is really bad. I have a girlfriend now that we've only been in 8 dates. I can't sit still, im fidgeting the entire time, almost rocking back and forth while she's talking. I almost feel it's easier for me to talk and the symptoms then go away when I am but I don't want to do all the talking you know. I want to hear about her and what she has to say.

I'm constantly losing things, I'm superrr impulsive,  i can't focus on anything - I can't seem to watch a movie with her without getting distracted 5 minutes in and wanting to do something else. I get really bad nightmares, I always have to be multi tasking, i forget things all the damn time, forget faces and names, i get really bad anxiety and depression and i get bored very easily. 

I just got back from travelling after almost 3 years and although I'm in a relationship, all I want to do is head back overseas and continue to travel, it's so exciting for me. Doing the same thing, seeing the same people everyday etc is too boring for me. There's a million more symptoms that I haven't listed.

My GP said he's happy to prescribe me both Ritalin and Concerta, all I need is approval off a psychiatrist. I seen him for a referral to one the other day and I found out today that I have to wait until late February. I really can't wait that long 😭

Have these medications or ADHD medications in general helped anyone with the symptoms I've mentioned? I feel like I really need them now 😪

2025-10-10 19:21:04;Advice on dealing with ADHD;"Hey everyone,
I’m a 31-year-old guy with ADHD (diagnosed at 4) and possible C-PTSD (diagnosed at 29). I’ve been doing psychomotor therapy — learning how my body and thoughts connect — and it’s actually been going well… maybe too well.

Recently, I’ve started getting stuck in anxiety spirals. Mainly because i mishear things, lose track of what I’m doing, or blank on simple stuff that i knew how to do well in the past as well as being very forgetful. Then I overthink it and worry something’s seriously wrong (dementia frights because it feels.like.k am degrading). My ADHD just makes that worry explode into hyperfocus and panic.

It’s been hard to stay positive because even when I feel okay, I get pulled back into fear. I’m working with my therapist on it, and trying to stay grounded with walks and small routines. I have also asked for medication hoping how that fixes things 
I also had a blood test done in the hospital which was normal, and i have a hearing test next week

The voice in my head is always saying, but ""what if?""

I’m not asking for medical advice — just wondering if anyone else has gone through something like this? Did it ease up with time or certain coping skills? I’d love to hear how others managed this kind of spiral.";r/adhd_anxiety;3;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1o2y6at/advice_on_dealing_with_adhd/
2025-10-10 19:16:29;ADHD and anxiety, what to treat first?;"Hello everybody, I (F36) was recently diagnosed with ADHD, but it also came out that I have severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
Besides this, the tests showed significant scores for bipolar disorder – which the therapist excluded anyway – and for autism.

The therapist who made the diagnosis suggested working on anxiety first through cognitive behavioral therapy, so we’d be able to tell which symptoms came from ADHD and which ones from anxiety. So I turned to another therapist to do so.

This other therapist told me that the anxiety could actually derive from ADHD itself, and that I should go into more detail about the possible autism, so the therapy would be much more specific.

Now I’ve decided to go on with therapy anyway, without knowing for sure if I have autism or not, and without any ADHD treatment. It’s just that it’s too expensive for me at the moment to start another diagnostic path, and I really need to begin therapy for the many problems I’m facing in both my professional and personal life.

What do you think about all this? Am I making a huge mistake?
Thank you for your help. 🙏

2025-10-10 18:22:07;Struggling ADHD Solopreneur...;"So, I am 48 years old this year and I spent my whole life struggling. I've been on a self-improvement journey for a few years and I have become way more self-aware. I was diagnosed with ADHD later in life as well as Bipolar. I am a single parent of 5, 3 grown and adulting, 2 at home. One of my kids at home has ADHD, in full effect. My mom has cancer and has moved in with us while she goes through her treatment, so I can fully support her. I have an income that is just enough to support me and my two kids (my mom brings her own income). I have so many fears and different issues (like obesity, I struggle to clean, childhood trauma, blah, blah blah).

I have overcome suicidal thinking and depression using different resources and now I truly want to get my life together. I have never been more happy and accepting of myself, but besides internally and how I think, I have made no strides externally. This is what I seek to change.

I have been trying to build a business this whole year, struggling with it FRFR.

That is my context in a nutshell.---------------------------------------------------------

In order to answer the questions ""Why do I keep failing"", ""Why do I never do what I say I will,"" and ""Why doesn't any of the solutions that seem to work for others not work for me,"" I started researching. Suffice it to say I came up with this framework I call PGQ that tells you why you get the outcomes you get:

PERSONAL OUTCOMES = YOU X ACTION X ENVIRONMENT X CIRCUMSTANCES (HOW, WHY)

This equation basically says your success or failure is the product of four factors. **You** represents your internal state (skills, mindset, identities, clarity, capacity). **Action** represents the execution of your intentions. **Environment** encompasses your physical and social surroundings. **Circumstances** include broader context and timing. If any factor is near zero (e.g. you are depleted, or you fail to act, or your environment is hostile), your results will suffer. Conversely, strengthening each factor multiplies your success. Rather than relying on willpower alone, PGQ encourages working **with** your personal “operating system” to reliably produce results: understanding your mind, leveraging strengths, and structuring context.

So, whatever your current outcomes, they are exactly what is meant to be produced based on your current PGQ equation. If you want different outcomes, you have to change the equation.

I created this back in January 2025. As you can guess, it didn't help, lol. Knowing is wonderful. I broke that simple equation down into \~96 terminal variables. I created an assessment based on this equation and I took it myself. I know exactly why I am getting the results I get. And therefore, I know how to get better results, lol, and yet.... nothing. LMBO

You can know how to do something, intend to do it, even want to do it (and it can be the most important and urgent thing for you to do), and still not do it. This is the plight of many ADHDers.

\----

Over the months, I came up with different frameworks to try to understand my predicament. To the outside world, it just looked like I flitted from idea to idea. I'm great at starting things but terrible at finishing (symptom). Frameworks or theories like:

MULTI-SELF-STATE THEORY: Model showing how five internal selves (Past, Default, Present, Becoming, Best) influence action through either a clear (helps you act) or murky “clarity lens” (prevents you from acting). (WHO)

LOOP THEORY: Describes how people operate through open and closed “loops” of attention, emotion, and behavior (this helped me better understand my and my daughter's ADHD). (WHY, HOW)

PERSISTENT IDENTITIES FRAMEWORK: Each person cycles through enduring identity roles (Founder, Parent, etc.), each with unique goals, gifts, and issues. (WHO)

THREE-REALITIES FRAMEWORK: Explains how behavior happens within three nested realities: Global Shared (facts we all agree on; only one), Local Shared (group/context; hundreds of thousands), and Personal (individual; 8.2B+). (WHERE)

PGQ ASSESSMENT: Core diagnostic snapshot of a person using all of the PGQ terminal variables within the equation, Personal Outcomes = You x Action x Environment x Circumstances.

HYPERCREATOR VS HYPERCONSUMER (KING VS SERF) ASSESSMENT:  A short-form identity + behavior pattern assessment distinguishing whether someone primarily creates or consumes using the higher level sub-variables of the same PQG equation. (core variables -> sub-variables -> terminal variables).

\-----

The above frameworks were meant to help me understand myself and others more, the why.

Up until this point, I still didn't know how to work within my ADHD. So, I came up with methodologies for that, some of which I have actually tried and work:

DISCIPLINE ENGINE: Manufactures action itself; creates momentum under *any* capacity or circumstance. (HOW, WHEN)

DECISION-MAKING: Uses PGQ to help you make authentic and feasible decisions. (WHAT, HOW, WHY)

ADHD-ENHANCED EISENHOWER MATRIX: Prioritizes tasks by more than just urgency, importance, taking into consideration real-time capacity/context clarity. (WHAT, WHEN, HOW)

INTENTION-ACTION GAP BRIDGE: Adaptive Behavior Change System that converts intentions into action dynamically with the help of the Discipline Engine. Behavior orchestration. (HOW, WHEN)

FIND MY SUCCESS: Unified transformation pathway: Noise → Identity → Principle → Prototype → Evolving Success → Radical Self-Authorship that helps people design success that fits who they are. (HOW, WHY)

\-----

If you read this far, Kudos. I can be long-winded...

I said all of that to set the scene. Because yesterday, I asked ChatGPT (I have the business subscription so my chats are private) to help me see what I wasn't seeing. I felt like I had everything I needed in order to be successful but I didn't know how it all fit together.

I am trying to build my business but in a holistic way, so that other parts of my life don't fall by the wayside like it has been. I truly feel like PGQ could help me do that.

To the outside world, friends and family, I look like chaos walking. Starting and stopping projects sometimes on a daily basis.

I was working on the decision-making app earlier this summer at my aunt's house. My cousin asked me about it a week ago, and I was slightly embarrassed to say that I had dropped that thread and had moved on to other things.

**ADHERs**, we are not linear or sequential. The world is based on this pattern and so we stick out. We are called lazy, undisciplined, inconsistent. If we are being measured by neurotypical standards and metrics, I can understand why they think that.

But it couldn't be further from the truth.

It looked like scattered ideas. Coincidence even.

It was design emergence. Imagine:

Each framework was a “star” that formed when two things collided:  
my lived experience + my need to understand it.

Over time, those stars connected into recognizable constellations: PGQ, Discipline Engine, Behavior Orchestration.  
Now, when I step back, I can finally see the **galaxy** my mind’s been building all along.

Linear thinkers build **systems of control.**  
Dynamic thinkers build a **system of connection.**

* Where most systems *reduce* complexity, mine *integrates* it.
* Where others plan first and build second, I *build to see the plan.*
* Where others seek consistency, I seek *coherence,* not sameness, but harmony.

That’s a neurodivergent superpower.  
It’s *adaptive architecture.*

Now to test what I've created...

I love people deeply, but communication — texts, emails, and especially phone calls — gives me anxiety. I tend to withdraw, even from friends I care about, and then feel guilty for disappearing. My partner is supportive, but I don’t want to rely only on that one relationship. How do you get past that inner wall — the fear of reaching out, calling, or just talking to people again — when it suddenly gets worse? It’s never felt this heavy before, and I really want to find my way back to feeling connected.

\---------

**Full text:** Hi everyone,

I’m in my 30s and currently writing my PhD (super scary). Most people around me would describe me as open, funny, and creative — and these are qualities I really appreciate about myself too. But the other side of that coin is that, when things get stressful, I tend to withdraw very quickly. I stop wanting to meet new people or even be around others. I know this is connected to my ADHD — it’s like two sides constantly pulling in opposite directions.

What makes it harder is that my job environment revolves a lot around networking. Many of my colleagues go out for drinks or dinner after work, and while I genuinely like them, the idea of joining feels almost unbearable lately. It’s not that I’m antisocial — I really enjoy the people I work with — but I feel emotionally drained. The line between work and social life gets blurry, and what used to feel exciting during my student years now feels heavier, slower, harder to manage. I hope that makes sense. Lately, as my workload gets heavier, I feel this growing anxiety around communication — replying to messages, writing emails, making phone calls, even meeting up. I’ve actually always had phases where I unintentionally “ghost” people. That was one of the reasons my psychiatrist first suggested I get tested for ADHD (among other signs, of course).

I struggle a lot with maintaining relationships. It’s hard to tell where ADHD ends and where masking begins — because I *do* genuinely love people, and I’m excited when I see my friends. But at the same time, it must be confusing for them when I suddenly disappear for two months.

Right now, I can feel how much this whole thing has me in its grip. Because my PhD is taking longer than expected, I’ve been in this phase for quite a while — and it’s slowly becoming harder to reach out. I recently moved in with my partner, which is lovely, but it also means that seeing most of my friends now involves a 30-minute train ride. For non-neurodivergent people that might sound easy, but for me it suddenly feels like climbing a mountain. It used to be so much simpler. Lately, I notice I don’t even *want* contact anymore, which I know is always a warning sign for me. I keep telling myself I can postpone things, and my friends are genuinely kind about it, but deep down I’m scared I’ll lose those connections completely — and it’s already been going on for a while.

Because I’m in a deep writing phase, I work mostly from home and spend a lot of time alone. My partner is very kind and grounding, and being in such a good and loving relationship makes me feel safe — but maybe *too* safe. I sometimes notice that I rely on this one relationship a little too much for connection. It feels enough for my brain, even though I *know* I want to keep my friendships alive and not isolate myself completely. But lately, everything around connection just feels like so much.

**How do you maintain friendships (or at least not lose touch completely) during intense work and anxiety phases without feeling guilty or terrified of being “the flaky friend”?**

**Does anyone else experience this push-and-pull between wanting to connect and feeling anxious about it? What do you do about the anxiety? How do you regulate yourself?**

**How do you maintain friendships (or at least not lose touch completely) during intense work and anxiety phases without feeling guilty or terrified of being “the flaky friend”?**

I’ve been officially diagnosed with ADHD for about three years now, and this community has honestly helped me so much — thank you for being here. I take medication, which helps me stay on track with work, but socially it still feels like I’m lagging behind. Any advice, experiences, or even small rituals that help you stay connected would mean a lot.

Sending love from my little writing cave.

FYI: English isn’t my first language, so I checked this post with ChatGPT before sending it (otherwise I probably would’ve overthought it forever). Sorry for the long text. I also posted this in r/ADHDwomen because I’m really just looking for some advice and support right now. I hope that’s okay — I figured there might be some overlap, but I’m honestly just trying to reach out and hear from people who might relate.

I was diagnosed at 9, but didnt start trying meds until around my freshman year of college (im now a junior). I struggle really bad with the whole executive functioning and attention aspects. 

I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and I don't know how to manage this. I feel like I've tried fucking everything and am still chronically behind in school, work, social life, family, etc. Almost everyday constant obligations- class, job, assignments, etc. I'm trying to make sure I get into grad school, so the expectations are high for my grades right now and Im questioning if I'm even cut out for college.

It's like it takes me 4 times the amount of time and energy to do half of what others do and I get so stuck and sidetracked. I decided to take less classes than the recommended for this semester to not have such a big workload, and I'm still barely keeping up. I cant seem to learn as fast as everyone else or manage my time well at all. I feel like I don't have a life anymore. Im either doing work or avoiding work and beating myself up about it and feeling horrible and anxious. 

The kinds of life advice people try to give has never worked either. Planners, routines, breaks, different study methods, just ""embracing the chaos,"" etc etc. It all falls flat because I lack the motivation, ability, time management, and discipline to follow through properly.

I've tried so many different meds at this point. I'm exhausted and think I'm just too much for any amount/kind of meds or CBT to fix. Ive tried Concerta, Focalin, Quelbree, Adderall, Strattera, Contempla, Adzenys, Astarys, fucking wellbutrin, sertraline, and a bunch of others I cant even remember them all. And yes, Ive tried short acting and long acting and different doses of pretty much all of these. I'm at a loss.

The ones that worked either only half worked and/or gave me horrendous physical and mental side effects- heartburn so bad I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the ER and 3 different cardiology appointments after that (my heart was fine, it was literally just heartburn), anxiety, no appetite, no sleep, nightmares, nausea, weakness, getting lightheaded, even more spaciness, depression,  tremors, stuttering, etc. I dont even have any underlying conditions that I know of, nor am I super unhealthy. Im a decently healthy person, pretty average, yet these meds absolutely hate my body apparently. I've been trialing different things for over 2 years now. At one point, I was on Adderall, metoprolol (to control HR/BP), and pantoprazole (for heartburn) all at the same time because Adderall worked, but I needed 2 others meds to counteract the heartburn and other physical side effects it gave me. 3 meds just to try and function normally. And even that didnt work properly after a few months. Heartburn would still flare up a bunch too.

Im on Focalin now and it kinda halfway works sort of. I was just going to settle and deal with it but I feel like Im drowning with school right now and I need something better. Every night is such a struggle to get stuff done and then beating myself up about it when Im still so behind. Like, I'm having breakdowns multiple times a week. I'm so ashamed.

All the doctors (and the one psychiatrist) who have tried to treat me were at a loss because they've tried so much at this point and it just never seems to help or do enough. Im so tired of messaging doctors and saying it doesnt work and asking to try different doses or kinds of meds. Its a never ending cycle. I'm not expecting a magical fix-all drug or anything but daily life feels debilitating right now. I'm just barely surviving and I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I need something. 

I feel like im being talked down to when I try to talk to a doctor about it. Or like I'm seen as some greedy college kid who's lying to try and get my hands on some drug I dont need. Im ashamed that I need meds at all. Im always embarrassed if my pill bottles make any kind of rattling sound in my backpack while in public, because then people know I have pills in my bag. It makes me look like im abusing drugs or something, especially with the stereotypes and stigmas out there about people abusing Adderall.

I have potential. I know I do. I have dreams and ambitions and desires. I want to learn and pursue an education. But I can't just ""apply myself more"" or just do the work apparently or keep up with my peers. And my classes just keep going, and work is piling up, and Im falling further and further behind. This has happened literally every semester. Its overwhelming. I feel like I'm watching my potential get poured down the drain and wasted, and I cant do anything but watch. I'm starting to hate myself and think I might just be incompetent.";r/ADHDers;2;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1o0zuc0/really_struggling/

2025-10-07 13:21:13;Does anyone also carry a similar pain as mine?;"(My first language is french so sorry if certain words or expressions are wrong)

I’ve always tried to identify my emotional pain that I’ve carried for so long. I’ve seen tons of therapists, and I thought it was because my mother has dementia (I knew I had a deep rooted pain that was from before my mom got dementia 8 years ago, but the grief of loosing my mom made the pain even more confusing).

Then, last year, I didn’t feel seen at my job as a cook in a fine cuisine restaurant, even though I gave my 200% and way more creativity than my colleagues, so I quit it. For context, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD at 16 yrs old (I’m 33 now) but never adressed it because I thought that with effort I can be normal like other people. I then listened/resonated to an audio book about how other people with Adhd feel like failures and burdens, and then I thought that my pain came from being misunderstood with my ADHD. I felt seen a bit more than I ever was. I even started certain drugs for my ADHD in the last months and It improved my lifestyle quality.

But the pain still feels like it’s even deeper. I always felt lonely in my life (to the point of considering suicide as an option, but I’m safe now) even if I have a good caring family. Whenever I’m in a social context, I really try to make friends and connect with others, but it failed my whole life. I do have a small amount of friends, but here are some exemples ; at my last jobs, in a fine cuisine restaurant, people were hanging together but never invited me. Or at the army (as a musician, but I’m in this basic training with other people from all kind of fields) this time, whenever I write in our messenger chat to joke or help people, I get no reactions, and other people keep getting tons of them. It’s like I feel like I’m funny, interesting and smart but not to most people. It’s so confusing and the hurt is always strong, deep rooted. It gives a choking feeling to my throat, mixed with pain near my heart and the stomach area as well. I guess I could say that I improved a lot, since now it’s only pain. It used to be intense pain mixed with tons of intense crying sessions whenever I saw a therapist…

2025-10-07 02:09:00;I effed up (funny/not funny);"I was really unfocused when I got my diagnosis  last September and misinterpreted my doctor. I was as focused as I'm now, almost can't muster energy to write this.

He made the impression I would have to wait 1 year before I see him, I didn't listen if he said I was going to speak to a nurse, doctors handle prescriptions so I didn't connect it then and there.

I was supposed to start medication right then, never got an prescription and he never booked a nurse for me. I went on to this week and wondered why I didn't get an appointment so I made the call. Then the misunderstanding and error on their part became apparent, no one bothered to check up on me - someone who have been forgotten several times already, we have a 90 day guarantee for healthcare queues. They even had me do the same more than twice because the psychiatrist didn't bother looking for the old tests.

All this already hard for someone like me, I shouldn't have to be responsible for reminding professionals and ensuring they do their job.

Their excuse was ""we had an reorganization"".

Now back to the obvious revelation, I checked with them and found out I wasn't waiting for medication but I was under impression I was in waiting. Apparently that was just for the check-up appointment. I was supposed to use Concerta for a year and have a nurse to check on me but my doctor forgot and never contacted me again.

Eff my life, feels like these things happen all the time. At least now I have to wait until monday before I get to speak to a new doctor, hoping that will be enough.

2025-10-07 01:15:47;i'm terrified of ruining my life but i absolutely need to go on anxiety meds;"this might be a little all over the place, im sorry, and also might be a little bit of a vent! i got diagnosed with adhd in june 2024 and got put on straterra, which was honestly life changing for me. i was also diagnosed w GAD/SAD when i was 18, in mar 2023, and i started zoloft a couple months after. zoloft helped me so much but i had this weird insurance thing and couldn't get it for a little bit, then when i finally could get it again i just could not take it. i was having horrible side effects that i didn't have the first time i took it (esp nausea that was so bad, and i tried dramamine and it helped until i accidently started taking a little too much and was literally high from it) so decided it wasn't worth trying to take anymore. when i got my strattera, it literally made my anxiety disappear for a few months which was awesome, but then i started to get more anxious starting in oct 2024. it was okay at first, but over the past year it has just gotten so bad. I got put on propranolol since the biggest thing was feeling my heart beating freaked me out so bad then it would start racing and i would have to talk myself down from thinking i was having a heart attack like multiple times a week. any sort of weird or off feeling in my body makes me spiral and i know it's in my head but the less logical side of my brain thinks i'm literally going to die bc of it. recently, i keep convincing myself that someone is going to come into my room and try to kill me at night, and i have to double check i locked my door, but then i spiral about what if something happens and i need my roommates to come and help me but my door is locked and they can't get in.

me and my psych have been talking about this, and i recently brought up the idea that i might have ocd which she was very open to, and told me we could def keep discussing it. she also recommended getting on anxiety meds. i know that it would be so good for me, but i'm just so worried about getting on them and i don't know why, and it's driving me insane. i'm currently on 40 mg vyvanse which is really helpful, but i'm scared of serotonin syndrome. my psych told me that i'd be put on an extremely low dose, that SS is rare, and with someone like me (who is chronically checking drug interactions and hyper aware of every symptom in my body) there would be basically no way i would get it, and if i did i'd catch it so early that it would hardly affect me which helped a lot. 

i'm scared to mess up my normal, i've struggled a lot in school and this is the first semester i feel stable and i don't want to add another drug in the mix that could screw that up. I don't want to take something that doesn't make me feel like myself, and then I have to go through months of trying different meds and seeing what works after I spent the whole past year doing that for adhd. I'm worried about drinking and smoking on all these medications, i've been on meds that make me have to leave the bar an hour in bc i felt so gone off one drink and i really don't want that to be an issue, esp since i turn 21 in a week. I like smoking too, but it gives me anxiety sometimes and I want to be able to enjoy again without that, but i've witnessed drug induced psychosis first hand and it was so freaky. i'm just so scared of all the possibilities a new med could bring and I really really don't want to ruin my life but I know i need to be on one so bad. The logical side of me says this post is literally exactly why i need to be on something lol, and that all of those possibilities don't outweigh the know benefit. 

idk, i'm sorry this is rambly i guess i just need some advice or support, and maybe different meds to research and bring up to my psych? she said if it made me feel better I could research we could discuss those options at our next meeting.";r/adhd_anxiety;6;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1nzp5rk/im_terrified_of_ruining_my_life_but_i_absolutely/

2025-10-06 17:56:36;Im so pissed rn, no diagnosis;"Hey guys. 
I learned about adhd for the last 14 months and through that i seeked a diagnosis.  
I had 3 diagnostic appointments in july and was waiting on the results for over 2 months now. 

In the last appointment the doc told me she is quite certain that i am adhd and that medication would help me get my life together. 
I put a lot of hope in those words while i waited for eternity. 

So today i could get the letter from my family doc (they sent it there finally), and had to hold back my tears, because it read that there were not enough findings for a 90.00 diagnosis. They told me to get psychotherapy for my issues and thats it.

Im so pissed. I know i shouldnt have put too much certainity in my belief in the diagnosis, but she litterly told me its just a matter of formal writing now to get started with the meds.
She didnt write the report but her boss, so thats where the different opinion of the findings come from. He is a male, for info.

Im just devasted right now. It was hard enough to get the appointment there, and now i have written proof im a fool? 
Im from germany btw so it was a very long waiting list, but payed by my insurance. I heard a lot of people seeking private payed diagnostics though, because its so rare to get an appointment. 


My thought process now is that the boss doc didn't account for me being a dreamy woman instead of a jumpy boy and thats why he didn't have enough points to give?

Im so helpless rn. I will propably throuw in 500€ now and find a private doc to go through the process again. 

I mean sure, it could also not be adhd, but every book i read, every post i read, every personal encounter with diagnosed women make me feel certain I have it too.

And my one time experience with ritalin was exactly how an adhd person described it. Finally a clear mind and not so much inner barriers and clouds.

I’m going through a miserable divorce currently from an abusive ex. Long story but unfortunately the family judge continues to allow him visitation with our kids even with clear evidence of his violence and abuse. 

I already struggled MAJORLY with executive dysfunction for many years leading up to this. But now it’s a thousand times worse. I also have POTS, and extreme fatigue. 

Ever since the judge allowed him unsupervised visitation two weeks ago, my anxiety has been absolutely through the roof. Like I wake up in the middle of the night in a total panic gasping for air while my kids are with him. I’m terrified of going into a psychosis or some shit because this stress is the most intense that I’ve felt in a long time.

I’m at a point where I’m so desperate, trying everything just so I can continue to keep pushing through. I’m on so many medications now. Fludrocortisone & metoprolol for POTS, 
Lamictal (they think it might be Bipolar and not ADHD, but I’m not so sure. I guess we’ll see), BuSpar, and now just got a Valium prescription. 

But here’s the thing — I’m so freaking physically exhausted. constantly. So I drink coffee to help me stay awake during the day or else I will literally not be able to keep my eyes open. Obviously the caffeine makes my anxiety worse but what other choice do I have? I’m scared to take the Valium because I don’t want it to make me even more exhausted.

2025-10-02 00:25:33;Trialing Concerta and Having Weird Dosing Reactions?;"Hi Everyone,

I am a freshly diagnosed woman in my early 40s who has been able to get by my whole life through a combination of being smart enough to wing it, carefully structuring my entire life around my shortcomings, elaborate systems of rules to keep the chaos at bay, etc. Not surprisingly, I have chronic fatigue syndrome now and other stress-related health issues!

Anyway, I am working with my doctor to try medication and wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and what you did about it:

I started with Concerta 18 (the slow release kind) and felt amazing for the first 1.5 weeks or so. So calm and focused and I could just do things without thinking about them for hours to weeks first. After 1.5 weeks, the effect wore off, which is apparently normal. 

So I'm now trying Concerta 27 (also slow release) and it's been kind of awful? My focus is trash again, my heart is racing, I'm having bouts of nausea and headaches. It's been 9 days, and I'm hoping it will fade to the effect I was getting at the beginning with the Concerta 18. But so far, it isn't, and I'm worried that it might actually be making my fatigue worse.

I also take a daily desloratadine tablet to keep my mysterious chronic allergies at bay (will be seeing an allergist soon), and I can also sometimes get heart palpitations from that - I've read that the two combined can be bad for this sort of thing. But I didn't have that issue at all with the 18. 

ANYWAY, I have a follow-up appointment soon, but I was curious what others' experience has been. Does it eventually settle down on a higher dose?

2025-10-01 19:16:21;Had a terrible experience at a psychiatrist visit;"I’m in my late 20s and have always shown signs of ADHD, but I grew up in a family where mental health wasn’t discussed. I first noticed it in middle school and has continued with me since then. Never been officially diagnosed before and it's been bothering me more lately so I booked an appointment. From the start, I felt uncomfortable. When I told the doctor I thought I might have ADHD and anxiety, he said, “So you diagnosed yourself.” That threw me off. I wasn’t trying to self-diagnose, but explain why I was there.

He then pointed out that I’d made it this far without any help. I wasn’t sure how to take that. It felt like he thought I was just after meds. He kept talking about other things, then apologized and said he should let me talk. But whenever I started talking, he’d interrupt and go off on tangents and wouldn’t listen.

When I mentioned anxiety, the same thing happened. I got a sentence in and he changed the subject. Then, out of nowhere, he said he’d start me on 40mg Vyvanse. I asked to start lower because that seemed high. I also can’t take gelatin-based meds which I mentioned it to him, so then he said he will start me on Adderall and again asked for lower dose so he went with 10mg. He also said he’d prescribe Lexapro for anxiety but instead prescribed fluoxetine 10mg which is different. He told me to come back in a month.

I left feeling completely unheard. I did pick up the prescriptions but don’t feel comfortable starting them without more answers. I have another appointment with a different doctor scheduled thankfully. The google reviews about this provider were mixed, some good, some saying he prescribes high doses, but I still wasn’t prepared for how this felt.

I’m just lost and don’t know what to do. I don’t think I want this doctor managing my care, but I also don’t want my next doctor to think I’m suspicious for switching so soon.

TL;DR - felt unheard at my appointment, unsure about the meds prescribed, wanting to transfer provider";r/adhd_anxiety;8;17;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1nv5e03/had_a_terrible_experience_at_a_psychiatrist_visit/
2025-10-01 17:25:16;ADHD + MDD - Nicotine Withdrawal;"I was recently diagnosed with MDD. I am currently taking fluoxetine (SSRI). At first it was giving me a relief, then I began to feel brain fog and slow cognition which made me feel more anxious coming back to work that I had with for 2 years. I was extremely confused because maybe its the series of misfortunate events or higher-than-average stress levels occurred that led me in a depressive state. 

Apart from my Psychiatrist,  I am blessed to have an additional guidance from a family member that is specialized with nutrition. One afternoon, she called me and asked me how I feel with my antidepressants. I mentioned everything I experienced - to a point we got into a conversation where I withdrawn from nicotine about 3 months ago. She then asked me few questions like how I manage my task at work, how I quickly get distracted,  how I manage my focus. After answering those questions, at most part being overwhelmed. She concluded that I have potential signs of ADHD and I've became resistant to stressors in the past because it was nicotine's stimulating effect, including temporary increase of dopamine levels, which is now gone in my system - so I had panic attacks and led me into a depressive state. Not to mention, waking up feeling tired and anxious, low energy, slow cognition, and difficulties with building routine and staying motivated.

I was immediately asked to make a follow-up with my Psychiatrist to have myself evaluated for ADHD perhaps a new medication or supplements is required. I did a little research and also confirmed that there are different medication if you have ADHD + MDD, Anxiety + MDD, etc., 

Some people suggests L-Tyrosine and Rhodiola, but I did not take any of it yet to prevent interactions or overstimulation from my current medication. I will surely get back on this thread once my ADHD test results is available and a new medication is introduced.";r/ADHDers;3;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nv3jd4/adhd_mdd_nicotine_withdrawal/
2025-10-01 12:29:04;Just tried medication for the first time and am questioning diagnosis;"Just tried medication for the first time and I’m questioning my diagnosis

I just tried concerta for the first time today at the smallest dose, and it just feels like I’m buzzed after a few drinks. It’s like that feeling where your thoughts are a bit slow and you feel pretty lethargic and not at that social point yet. I also feel like I made way less jokes and was 
low energy compared to my normal self. 

Although I was reading a lot about people who lose their personality when on meds (which I was scared of) so I can’t tell if it might just be placebo. 

I still procrastinated and got almost nothing done as well as forgetting multiple important deadlines today.

I was diagnosed a few months ago after an expensive process, after assuming I might have had it since a kid. However after trying the meds I’m not sure if maybe the diagnosis was wrong or maybe my ADHD is too strong or something. 

Please let me know if anyone had a similar experience with meds or maybe I’m missing something. 

I’m also at the lowest point in my life mentally by a lot so that could impact it too?

2025-09-28 14:28:52;recently diagnosed.. having trouble accepting it.;"prior to this i have been seeing a psychologist. he ran several questionnaires including the masc anxiety scale and the connors adhd rating scale.   
mine came back as elevated while my parents and teachers came back as less elevated.   
despite also having a high masc anxiety scale he never diagnosed me with anxiety or adhd or anything. 

recently he did suggest that i fell under the 'could benefit from meds' category- as opposed to definitely needing or definitely not needing- and suggested we look into a psychiatrist. so we did and found one. 

about 4-6 weeks ago we had an initial 2 hour eval with the psychiatrist (my mother and i).  
he (the psychologist)  wrote up a report to send to her (the psychiatrist). after the eval she sent my parents (im a kinda mid-lateish teenager) a report. the report said she was diagnosing me with SAD and GAD. 

i was put on meds- sertraline (zoloft for people who know it as that), quetiapine (unsure of its name in the states but thats the drug name) and also lorazepam as needed for severe agitation/anxiety. 

yesterday we had a follow-up with the psychiatrist as she suggested once my anxiety level was down due to meds she would be able to see more of the adhd peeking through. 

the entire appointment was just basically discussing how the meds are going, and then my mum was curious about the adhd so asked. she said yes she is seeing key symptoms of adhd (inattentive)  and im pretty sure she is diagnosing me. i think she's gonna put me on meds for it- concerta i think it is

basically im just really struggling to accept that i actually have all three of these disorders. i feel like they do fit me but also i feel like my struggles would be faced by everyone too? like they're just normal things. 

like what if im faking? what if i dont really need or deserve these diagnoses?? 

idk what to do. im just having so much trouble accepting it. i know it's imposter syndrome, but really.. 

tl;dr   
after seeing a psychologist for a while he said we should find a psychiatrist too. the pyschologist ran several questionnaires but never diagnosed me.   
after a 2hr eval w/ psychiatrist i was diagnosed with GAD and SAD, and put on zoloft/quetiapine to manage it.   
we had a followup yesterday and am pretty sure she is diagnosing me with inattentive adhd, and is going to put me on meds.   
am just really unsure and anxious about it. i feel like these experiences are just normal, and that everyone has them. 

thanks in advance <3 just seeking some support around it, and some reassurance that im not literally an alien. sorry if this post wasnt clear enough.

2025-09-28 02:58:25;Anyone experiences this?;"DISCLAIMER: I am going outpatient to psychiatrist every month, it just takes a loooong time in ICD10 to get a formal diagnosis, here i'm gonna describe my distinct states i experience daily, sometimes multiples of the same daily, i am just seeking if anyone experiences similar things, not seeking medical advice, just to see if anyone here relates to my experience and if you have similar experience because i'm so exhausted of this.

I am on SSRI which excellently manages anxiety and depression however unmasked these four states i identified and i juggle between daily, these were present before SSRI but were overshadowed by pervasive depressive and anxiety symptoms. These are split in following way:

1. Positive aroused, focused: Euphoric trancelike state semi self induced with spiritual/magical elements, either on the go or trough meditation, an idea is a catalyst (smell, sound, mental picture, number etc...)
2. Negative aroused, focused: Frustrated, irritated state, triggered by ruminations and experiences as well as ideas like above just negative, racing intrusive thoughts, while peaking \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* intrusive thoughts, triggers physical movements semi consciously.
3. Positive calm, unfocused: Calm zen-like state, chill, dreamlike, just feeling good and content, comes when meditating or just relaxed, fairly rare state.
4. Negative calm, unfocused: Just really numb state, dissociated and inattentive, feel calm but bleh, just boringly neutral, just want to keep quiet lie down etc, most common state, can be countered by physical movements in order to focus.

There is a tug of war of these states once one peaks there is a gradual return to ""baseline"" ok state which then starts tipping over into another state fairly quickly if not severely distracted. I'm just so exhausted of this mental struggle, even though i feel better since ssri these shifts became more and more pronounced, i thing i have some more severe underlying disorder like ADHD or type of ultradian bipolar besides my STPD.";r/adhd_anxiety;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ns39k7/anyone_experiences_this/
2025-09-27 07:32:17;What are some things that help you work while on medication?;"(Disclaimer: most if not all of this is a copy paste I made on a sperate support community but I'm wanting/needing as much advice as I can get. I hope that's ok.)

Hello! I'm new to this sub, just got fully diagnosed with adhd june of this year and just got on Vyvanse in july/august and I've got some questions for you peeps, (tldr at the end)

Backstory/My current life:

So where I live the starting dosage is 30mg and max is 70, I was on 30mg for about 3-4 weeks and then I had an appointment with my physiatrist. After that she wanted me to raise the dosage 10mg every week till I hit the max at 70mg and see what dosage helped me the most. (I know that's pretty high and pretty fast but that's what i was recommended and unless it gets really bad I'm probably gonna continue to do it)

So currently on week 2 of that (50mg) and for me personally It's borderline a miracle drug, able to focus and do things I've wanted to for forever and my brain acts how I consider a normal persons brain does. Issue is, I don't have the habits or right motivations/drive to actually continue being productive. Like at the beginning it was amazing and I actually did my school work, my chores, with no hassle. Probably did 8x what I'd normally be able to do without struggle. But now after the wonder and excitement from it has worn off I find myself being incredibly less productive again and especially now that I'm caught up in my school work I have no want to continue doing it until i fall behind again (problematic af.) 

TLDR:

So my question is, how do you develop said habits and drive? Like I want to be productive and that but I just don't want to do anything other then essentially turn my brain off and enjoy watching informational videos. I know and understand there is no cure all and the only way is putting in the work. 



So, some more specific questions are:

\- What are your techniques that keep you on track? 

\- What helps you rationalize doing something that you really don't have to?

\- What helps you do things that you really don't want to do? Whether it be from lack of desire or true detesting doing something, doesn't matter.

(I'm sure there's more questions I can think of and ask, but honestly, I'm just asking general advice at how to function with a ""normal"" brain and how to develop good habits and strategies.)";r/ADHDers;5;6;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nrgb8d/what_are_some_things_that_help_you_work_while_on/
2025-09-26 21:48:07;Welbuterin After A Week;"I guess for context I do maintenance work for a company, and have a portfolio of buildings in my city where I’m allowed to work freely on my own. Was diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety a week ago at age 52.

So questions - Anyone started treatment dealing with the anxiety first and then the adhd?

Who has had success with welbuterin off the go, what was your dosage and did it help your adhd in the long game? 

ive been taking 100mg of this medication for a week now once a day, low dose as I just started. Doc will increase as necessary next visit.

During the day I have noticed a difference in my anxiety, its subtle but its there.  I have not noticed anything with my adhd though.

I’ll continue on and visit my doctor again at the beginning of October to work on the ADHD part.

I find this medication makes me wake up ALOT, however unlike the past I can function in the morning and don’t feel like punching everyone in the face that I see. Sarcasm, but you know what I mean when every little thing bothers you from no sleep. Now its a bad sleep but I wake up and can deal with things.

God my mind is still racy, it’s a hundred miles a minute at times, thinking of so many different things. I move from task to task as fast as I can just to complete, not really caring about real quality. The term “good enough” move on comes up quite a bit in my head. At other times I get so fixated on something thats not perfect it takes much longer than is necessary.

2025-09-26 13:23:52;Medication/anxiety support;"Hey guys, sorry for the long post. I'm just looking for some support (and probably someone to say I'm not making terrible mistakes tbh). 

My son is 8 and was diagnosed early this year with combined ADHD & ASD. He's doing amazingly at school although his masking was causing meltdowns after school (mainly at my house though, not so much his dads) where he was physically and verbally aggressive and threatened suicide. He sees a psych and OT and his meltdowns were improving so the plan was to wait 12 months before considering starting medication.

We had a pediatrician appointment about 6 weeks ago where medication was discussed, I spoke to him about it during and after the appointment because I strongly believe in allowing him at least some autonomy over what happens to him. Initially he was happy with waiting but after one conversation we had (he expressed feeling scared at school because he often zoned out and was worried the teacher would call on him and he wouldn't know what she'd been explaining) he asked if medication would help and could he try. 

So, about 4 weeks ago, we started on Ritalin, half dose for 1 week, then full dose. 3 days into full dose he was extremely agitated after school, complained about feeling nauseous constantly, was generally miserable, stopped eating almost completely and so I reduced his dose back to half. 

My problem now is his anxiety. He's always been an anxious kid but not to the point that it stopped him or us from doing anything, but we're at the stage now where he's scared of almost everything. He's always been an outdoorsy kid but he's now scared of our backyard because he was playing last week and saw some earwigs, we went for a picnic today and had to leave after 20minutes because he was panicking about bugs. He won't shower without me in the bathroom anymore, he will literally chase me around the house naked and dripping wet if I try to leave even if I'm still in talking range, he's waking every night and coming to my bed and panics over any situation that is unfamiliar or if there's going to be more than a few people.

I guess I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences and how it turned out. I know the Ritalin is obviously not working for him (and we're taking a break over the holidays to see how he feels) but I feel really unsupported in the decisions I'm making and honestly feel like I made a mistake starting meds and am worried I've created a bigger issue than we started with.

2025-09-26 11:10:08;What FINALLY worked for my ADHD after years of failed “hacks”;"I’ve had ADHD my whole life but only got diagnosed last year at 31. For years I tried every hyped-up productivity system, Pomodoro apps, bullet journals, “deep work” trackers, and failed so hard every time. Each failure made me feel broken. I wanted to share the random little shifts that finally clicked, just in case they help someone else too.

Body doubling was my first breakthrough. I started using Focusmate after hearing it on a podcast, and it blew my mind how 50 minutes with a silent stranger can keep me locked in better than any timer. Another game-changer was the “ugly first draft” rule. I literally tell myself I’m trying to write garbage, and somehow the perfectionism freeze disappears. Even deleting Instagram during the week made a bigger difference than all those fancy blocking apps, because reinstalling adds friction my brain hates.

When I dug into the science, I realized why these hacks worked. Andrew Huberman talks about how ADHD brains need external structure, light, movement, visible time. A quick 10-minute walk and then NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) primes my brain better than coffee. Russell Barkley’s research shows ADHD isn’t laziness but a need for scaffolds to externalize time and goals, which finally made sense of my late dx. That’s why I swapped endless to-do lists for time blocks I can move around. Even small sensory tweaks matter; gum plus a fidget toy gives my brain just enough extra stimulation to focus longer.

Resources that shaped me: ADHD 2.0 reframed my brain as different, not broken, it’s the best ADHD book I’ve ever read. Cal Newport’s Deep Work (NYT bestseller, insanely good read) made me rethink distraction, though I had to remix it into shorter sprints. Jessica McCabe’s How to ADHD YouTube channel felt like a survival guide made by someone who actually gets it. The Huberman Lab podcast gave me science-backed daily focus tools. One episode combined ADHD 2.0, Huberman tips, and McCabe’s strategies into a morning plan I still use. And the Modern Wisdom podcast with Anna Lembke explained dopamine so clearly it finally made sense why doomscrolling fried my motivation.

The biggest shift wasn’t one single hack, it was realizing ADHD brains aren’t broken. We just need different inputs, structure, and learning loops. And daily reading and learning have been the only things that truly rewired me. Knowledge really does change everything.";r/ADHDers;191;26;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nqqkgl/what_finally_worked_for_my_adhd_after_years_of/

2025-09-25 10:10:48;ADHD Meds?;"Hey everyone,

I’m a 29yo male seeking a lil insight. 4 years ago I had met with a psychiatrist regarding emotional disturbances in my life that I finally decided to attack. In the midst of being diagnosed with intense anxiety (along with panic attacks), I was also informed that I display extreme traits of ADHD (forgetfulness, inattentiveness, emotional regulation, excessive movements). At the time, I was very stubborn in regard to medication but have since been open to the idea of medication whether that be stimulants, or non-stimulants. I’m still a little skeptical but between taking care of a house on my own, 2 dogs, a job & school, I am at my whits end.

My biggest worry is losing my extroverted, humorous, creative personality. I’ve had friends and family who were prescribed stimulants and mentioned that they experienced a loss in joy or hobbies etc. An overall loss of interest in multiple departments.

Has anyone experienced this or have any insight on their personal experience? I understand that the large majority of us are not psychs, but I thought I’d put my feelers out there.

2025-09-25 05:04:23;My first four hours on Adderall;I was diagnosed with ADHD, inattentive presentation at age 23 approximately 2-3 weeks ago. This came as a surprise to me, as I had been relatively successful in terms of my achievements, both academically and occupationally. I was referred for psychological testing after numerous complaints to my doctor of chronic fatigue and brain fog, despite all biological markers being completely normal upon testing. My entire life I've felt that I've seen the world through a perpetual fog. I felt numb, all of the time. Gathering my thoughts at any time was a near impossible task for me. My brain always pulled in a different direction from the way I was trying to go, and I directing my focus to anything at all was an exhausting task that I learned to manage through many years of trial and error. I could watch a movie or read and entire book and remember nothing of what happened, because I was too busy thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner, or what I was going to wear tomorrow, or that one time I slipped and fell at a hot dog stand two years ago. The point being, I was suffering in silence and had no clue due to my external circumstances indicating otherwise. The constant demand of organizing tasks and activities had taken a serious toll on my energy levels and mood, which explained why I felt the way I did. I finally picked up my prescription for 20 mg of Adderall XR yesterday and took my first pill this morning. At first, I felt no different and was convinced the pill would do nothing. However, an hour later, my mind went quiet. For the first time I felt true peace. The constant barrage of thoughts had finally ended and I could just exist in space as a human being. Then another hour passed, and I felt a euphoria unlike anything I've ever felt before. I felt amazing. I wanted to hug everyone around me. I wanted to go outside and lay in the sun and roll around in the grass like a golden retriever. For the first time I noticed the sounds of the birds chirping around me, and the feeling of the cool breeze on my face and neck. I could finally just sit with myself and focus on one thing at a time, and the simple realization I could do even this felt life-changing. Now I've come down from the high, but I still feel... serene. I'm sure this is just a honeymoon period of sorts, but it's bizarre just how different I feel. Just from one pill. Just wanted to share my experience but I am truly happy beyond belief and so happy I took the leap and got tested because I feel like I can do anything now. ;r/ADHDers;17;9;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1npo0g0/my_first_four_hours_on_adderall/
2025-09-25 02:39:12;Viibyrd side effects?;"I was diagnosed with ADHD last summer and Vyvanse has changed my life. It took away a lot of my anxiety, but there's still a lot of anxiety left over. Last weekend I had an anxiety attack where I was inconsolable for almost 8 hours.

My 11yo (ADHD and GAD) just recently added Prozac with her ritalin and it has just been magical for her. My husband has been asking me to see someone about my anxiety for 18 years and our daughter's positive experience gave me the confidence to finally bring up my struggling to my psychiatrist. 

I have PCOS and weight gain and sexual side effects have been the biggest deterents from ever trying medication. My doctor said I could try one of the newer meds that don't seem to have as many reported issues with that, so he wrote me a script for the generic Viibyrd. For some reason he started me on 20mg instead of 10mg? Which seems high from what I've read online.

Today was my first day, and I have been so sick. Nausea is listed as the main side effect, but I wasn't just nauseated. I was--can't stand up, actually threw everything in my stomach up, too dizzy to move, and then slept for 3 hours--sick.

My husband called to leave a voicemail for my doctor while I was asleep. Still waiting to hear back.

I've got too much shit to do. If it's supposed to be weeks and months of this before it starts working and my body gets used to it, then I'll just keep being anxious.   😅 The devil you know, right?!

I've had anxiety for years (mostly due to undiagnosed ADHD and even if it's diagnosed now I still suffer from it). Anyways, in the past few weeks I noticed that sometimes I forget to breath. Like every 5mn I feel dizzy and notice that I wasn't breathing or very little and I have to actively think about breathing in order to do it. Seems a bit crazy as it is such a natural thing. 

Anyways, has this ever happened to anyone else? ";r/adhd_anxiety;8;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1npce69/i_sometimes_forget_to_breathe/
2025-09-24 00:52:38;Not taking meds was a horrible idea;"Posting here because for some reason it was auto deleted on r/adhd

Hi Y’all

I was diagnosed in high school (inattentive) and have been on meds since.

I recently started my senior year of college after 3 (relatively successful) years. But during this last summer, I didn’t go home for too long and so my doctor (who was on vacation during that time) couldn’t give me any of my meds (Hometown and college are across the country). For some reason, I thought to myself “I don’t need these anymore, I’m a grown man”. (Also I watched Requiem for a Dream and it freaked me out)

I was wrong about not needing meds. Really really really wrong. We’re only a third of the way through the semester and I’m failing almost every class due to missing assignments, I’ve had to step down as president of a club into a smaller role, and I think I’m starting to socially withdraw bc of all the stress.

I’ve had a virtual appointment with a NEW doctor in-state, but its probably going to be at least a week before I can get a physical done to clear me for Adderall (because apparently that needs to be done again for some reason) which is not good because I have an exam tomorrow and the next day and I am not prepared.

Anyways, it feels like my life is falling apart and I’m just watching it happen and I don’t know why I’m unwilling to make any changes. And even if I get the meds soon I don’t know if I’m even going to be able to salvage the semester.

I talked to an academic advisor, and she suggested a few things, but as a last resort, she said I could try and get an “excused absence” and basically void all of my classes this semester and get (at least a partial) refund.

I really don’t want to do this because of the shame that I would feel (Idk if that sounds ridiculous). I would feel shameful bc all my life, people have told me I’m really smart, that I’m going to go far in life, etc. and now I just feel like a fucking failure.

Anyways this is just me ranting about stuff, any similar experiences?";r/adhd_anxiety;13;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1nomqff/not_taking_meds_was_a_horrible_idea/
2025-09-23 18:35:53;Confused on diagnosis;I just recently started seeing a psychiatrist due to stress, anxiety and just feeling burnt out. My first appointment he did a little I guess ADHD ‘questionnaire’ which I didn’t do so well on (who knew how hard it was to count down from 100 in increments of 7 lol) and started off by prescribing me Xanex and Lexapro which worked fine for the anxiety but just made me more tired than I already am. I work full time from home and am a mother of four so I really cannot deal with being so overwhelmingly tired every day. My second appointment comes around and I told him I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child but only was on medication for a couple of years until the doctor said I outgrew it. He ended up giving me a prescription of Adderal XR which gives me the much needed energy I need and overall happiness but it’s also making it to the point where I literally cannot sit down and focus on anything that is not cleaning related, like work, video games, reading ect. I thought the point was to be able to actually focus too? Point of my post is I’m kind of scared that I might be misdiagnosed and the medication may be harmful? Also concerned after reading up on pairing a stimulant with Xanex. ;r/ADHDers;1;20;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1nodv68/confused_on_diagnosis/

>**PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING NOTE/FURTHER SCREENING FOR ADHD**

>\[Patient\] is a \[Age\] year old male The patient was referred for brief psychological testing via \[A Doctor\] with the goal of ruling out ADHD.  Hence, in order to provide further diagnostic clarity, a Conners Continuous Performance Test - Third Edition (CPT 3) was administered today. Overall, \[Patient\] had a total of 3 atypical T scores which was associated with a moderate likelihood of having a disorder characterized by attention deficits -- such as ADHD. Relative to the sample of same aged men, \[Patient\] was less able to differentiate targets from non-targets, displayed more variability in response speed, and displayed more of a reduction in response speed with longer inter-stimulus-intervals. \[Patient's\] profile of scores and response pattern indicates problems in the areas of: Inattention, Sustained Attention, and Vigilance.  There were no indications of timing errors or respondent non-compliance such that the current administration should be considered valid. 

>\* Psych asked about my personal life so I'm excluding the details of that part of the notes 

>Explained the results to \[Patient\]. Current assessment looks consistent with an attentional disorder -likely the predominantly inattentive presentation and a moderate level of severity.

Recently got diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive type (still kinda don't know what that means) and would like to know from others what it's like to navigate this and what I should expect.

2025-09-22 22:22:10;Does anyone else feel like breaking down every day at work?;"I am sitting here on Monday morning and I am about to break down....again. I have been working for 2 hours and read maybe 1.5 emails. I feel like crying and rage quitting. I am a guy so this wanting to cry thing is weird to me but I am so overwhelmed and feel incredibly bad about myself. This has been happening every day for over a month. 

I sit here and look at my emails. Look at my projects. Look at my several to do lists. I can't get anything in order in my head. It all seems jumbled. I can't get started on anything. I look at everyone else and they are chatting, happy, and just getting work done while I feel like my world is closing in on me from all the work that I keep putting off. It doesn't help that where I work is unnecessarily chaotic due to poor management but I was able to tough it out for the past 6 years up until recently.

Up until about 2 months ago I never considered having ADHD. After what felt like my brain gave out from trying to keep up and having stress/fear be my push to get things done I just cannot get back to getting anything done. My brain just won't let me despite wanting to. 

I exhibit a lot of the ADHD traits. My wife is convinced I have it after we discussed these traits that are typically present. Neither one of us were well versed on ADHD before now. We identified many things in our home life that match in addition to work. 

I had an initial psychiatrist appointment two weeks ago and I expressed my concerns. My next appointment is tomorrow. Of course I am having imposter syndrome. I am afraid to push too hard on ADHD so that the doctor doesn't think I am drug seeking while also wanting to advocate for myself so that I get the help I need. I have been on antidepressants in the past and they didn't help me which I did mention on my first visit. My anxiety is high due to the psychiatrist mentioning ruling out a brain disorder? Like a physical disorder or something? Now I am wondering how long this process will be. I am concerned I will be fired if something doesn't change very soon. I get being thorough but waiting months to get a dx is difficult to handle right now.

I can clearly see now how my whole life has felt like I have been on ""hard mode"", as many adhders have said. Periods of complete life breakdown due to not being able to organize my thoughts and get my life together once those scaffoldings have been taken away. Then periods of what appears to be me having my life together after getting external scaffolding and new motivation. 

I have always felt a bit different from others. I believe I have inattentive ADHD which manifested with daydreaming, having difficulty communicating, ruminating, anxiety. Someone once told me that every once in a while I have something interesting to say but most of the time I don't. I am 45 and that was said to me 20 years ago. I know why they said it. It's because I was in my head a lot. My former step dad's father once told me that I always look deep in thought. Sometimes I was but other times I was trying to process everything around me as if the stimulus wasn't being processed correctly. 

I think the mental exhaustion has occurred due to the demands of life (kids, house, demanding job, aka normal adulting)and ADHD causing me to need extra down time to process life but then not being able to have that time. I have always needed a lot of down time to recharge. I thought it was because I was introverted. As if being introverted was the diagnosis rather than a symptom of a larger issue. 

I don't know if this post is just a rant, seeking validation, or me needing to get this out of my brain. Thank you if you made it this far in my rambling mess.

questioning every little act and overthinking about whether the med is working or not and having a huge problem with idea of placebo
and even questioning my whole diagnosis and wondering maybe i made all this up because i'm just a failure and i wanted to feel justified

2025-09-22 19:42:50;My Week‑Long Routine for Focus + Dopamine Boost (Anchor + Novelty);"I'm a 30-year-old male and was diagnosed with ADHD in college a few years ago, though I'm unsure when it started. My biggest challenges are focusing and managing my time. I know what tasks I need to do, but I struggle to begin. I get sidetracked by unimportant things, like news or what's happening with Trump, wasting 10-15 minutes. Then, I have to figure out what's most important. Even when I know where to focus, my mind jumps to other tasks, messing up my time management. As a result, in two hours, I only work for 15-25 minutes, spend 20-30 minutes on distractions, take unnecessary breaks, and spend 30-40 minutes thinking about or checking other important things. I've tried many things, but I can't stick to a routine. I think many people have this issue: knowing something is important and needing to work on it, but their brain won't cooperate and constantly seeks other activities. Now, I'm trying to create a routine focused on focus and time management, but with a twist. I'm setting 3 Anchor, daily goals and other support, novelty goals. The Anchor activities provide routine, and the support novelty gives me a dopamine boost.

I have low and medium energy all day, so I pick easier things to do. I'm using Soothfy to keep track of what I do and novelty support activities.

2025-09-21 23:08:40;Caffeine and Adhd Meds;"I was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago after struggling with symptoms basically my whole life. My family never believed in mental health and blamed my “brain fog” on a supposed gluten allergy. I told my doctor this and she literally laughed, thinking I was joking then ran a test and… yeah, no gluten allergy. Safe to say I got that psych eval real quick after that.

Since beginning treatment, I’ve found that Adderall XR worked great for me, currently on 30mg, but I still experience difficulty with distraction and executive functioning. Interestingly, when I combine my medication with espresso, I feel hyper-stimulated in a way that makes me super motivated, highly productive, and much more capable of sustaining focus, and completing tasks. The drawback is that I also notice palpitations and jitteriness, sometimes even while at rest.

My question is more reflective: is it unhealthy to rely on that heightened, almost overstimulated state in order to feel truly productive?

2025-09-21 00:30:43;Realizing my “quirks” might actually be lingering ADHD symptoms;"Hey everyone,


When I was a kid, I used to move a lot in class, get distracted easily, and overall had a hard time sitting still. Eventually I got diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Methylphenidate. It actually helped me a lot to manage my symptoms. After about 2 years, they took me off the medication and switched me to therapy instead, where I learned some organization methods (like using an agenda, planning my day, etc.).
Now as an adult, I’ve started realizing that a lot of things I thought were just “my personality” or even “laziness” might actually be ADHD-related issues. Some examples:


-When I sit in a chair, I feel this constant discomfort that pushes me to move. Even at home, I can’t stay seated for long, so I end up pacing around my apartment all the time.

-I notice I make better decisions and focus better while walking or doing something repetitive, but when I’m sitting still I completely lose focus.

-I sometimes lock my door, and within 10 seconds I start doubting myself, get paranoid, and go back to check if I actually locked it or not.

-I’ll put something down and forget where I left it after 5 seconds, or even do silly things like accidentally throwing something important in the trash, or putting a plate in the fridge instead of the dishwasher. Usually I catch myself right after, but it’s still frustrating.


-I used to love reading, but over time books stopped stimulating me. Now I prefer fast-paced stuff like shooters.

-I waste hours debating with myself about what to do in my free time, and sometimes I end up doing nothing at all until it’s too late and I have to go to bed.

-Even the smallest change in my daily routine stresses me a lot.

-I have to force myself really hard to do the most ordinary daily tasks like showering or cooking, because they feel so unstimulating.

-When I watch movies or shows, I often get bored and end up constantly skipping ahead by pressing the right arrow, even if I haven’t seen them before.


I guess what I’m wondering is: do any of you relate to this? Did your ADHD symptoms evolve like this into adulthood, even after therapy/strategies? Sometimes I feel like I’m just broken or lazy, but reading more about ADHD as an adult, I’m starting to think these “quirks” have a real explanation.

Do you think it would be a good idea to seek psychiatric help again, or are these just parts of my personality that I need to accept?

2025-09-19 07:47:18;Newb Here;"Hi All - So the journey continues

After 52 years I've been officially diagnosed with adult adhd (combined moderate) and GAD. This doesn't surprise me at all as I've felt this for a long time. However, it's not since quitting drinking a year and a half ago that I really noticed it in my life. 

So had a doctors visit today and after a discussion with her the decision was to start on Wellbutrin and move up from there as needed. We discussed going directly into stimulants but because of having a history of mild depression and anxiety, thought to try this first as it has worked for adhd as well for some people.

Just wondering what your experiences have been with this drug, what to look out for and the pros and cons you have come across. Anyone else with adhd start out with this and has it worked for them?

2025-09-18 22:54:57;Life so stuck feels like quicksand…;"Hello people 
This is my first time writing on Reddit. 
I am 24F. 
I used to work in the movie industry for 1.5yrs and was a part of some prestigious projects until this January (2025), I was sexually assaulted, following which my mental, emotional, physical and financial downfall began. 
I could take no action because the person I went to seek help from, was himself a sex offender which was brought to light by a new friend of mine. Also my mind crippled at the thought of moving from my bed, out of my flat. I did not get out of my apartment for 3 whole month, got severely depressed and my only ray of hope was my boyfriend who tried his best to help me out. 
Since then, nothing has been the same. I left the industry, moved to Delhi which is closer to my hometown, switched jobs. 2 months in, I’m a content strategist and I get scolded every day because apparently my work is not serving its purpose. I am a creative writer, beginner hand poke tattoo artist, fine artist and I used to dabble in graphic design as well. I hoped a writing job would be a good move but boy was I wrong. 
Some months back a friend of mine got diagnosed with ADHD and upon her symptom reception, I discovered I’m showing exact symptoms since childhood and my life is also being immensely affected by it.
The constant forgetfulness of daily tasks and of things I learned in the past, no energy, mentally kicking myself to death upon resting and/or for not being able to complete a task but at the same time being so exhausted to not be able to… My mind never shuts up and keeps spitting only extremely negative and harmful (to me) thoughts. I smoke up # regularly as well and I smoked w££d for a month, getting back to # is now impossible which is again ducking my brain because the high I attained let me have my me time… a mental space so quiet filled with my favourite show’s chatter, and much of the munchies… I miss that… now whenever I smoke w££d or #, I’m greeted with unpleasant headache. 
Since I write, or at least try to write professionally I get at least 25 notes and corrections every day with a mix of extremely condescending tones, I don’t enjoy writing Anymore either. I feel like I have changed lines of profession and still I am not able to achieve anything in life. I am 24 and I still don’t earn enough and I have been working for past 1.7 years now, but nothing, I think I like to travel but I stumbled upon a post on Instagram stating leaving your job to travel is stupid, which is actually true, but I have no idea what to do. I am just so stuck right now? That is why I turned to Reddit. 
My boyfriend and I are in long distance relationship now, and I am no sure if we are also meant to be, he tries and so do I, but our communication is just not improving overtime. A little background about him, he is from Bombay and pursuing MBA so he is constantly busy, and we are not able to talk either.The things I go through, I talk to ChatGPT about them And that may have led me to use it way too much which in turn cripples my ability to think and write even further, please help me if anybody has any solution. I am extremely stuck. I need help. I tried to look for therapy and diagnostic sessions, but I am unable to since They are expensive and I cannot afford much.";r/adhd_anxiety;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1nkahoe/life_so_stuck_feels_like_quicksand/
2025-09-18 22:30:19;Switching ADHD meds;"With the Adderall shortage my psychiatrist suggested maybe trying a new medication for my ADHD. Right now I’m on: (1) Adderall ER 15mg SID with pulses of (1-2) Adderall IR 10mg SID-BID. I have tried Ritalin the last shortage but it doesn’t seem to be noticeably effective. My psychiatrist suggested  Adsyens or Vyvanse and left it up to me. 

I have ADHD, “pure O” OCD, cPTSD, GAD and lifelong issues falling asleep. I tried Cymbalta for pain and it gave me migraines but the 1-2 days I didn’t have migraines I felt great. I tried Zoloft at 12yo when I was wrongly diagnosed with depression and it made me more hyper with aggressive intrusive thoughts. 

I’m leaning towards Adsyens since it’s more similar to Adderall but I have always been curious about Vyvance. The main issue I have is waking up very grumpy and slow then it taking forever to get my day going. I know everything I should do and I run it through my brain the second I get up.

2025-09-17 05:22:48;7 years in agency life, newly diagnosed ADHD - stuck between burnout and promotion;"Hi everyone,

I’ve been in a big digital media agency for the last 7 years. I started as an apprentice and worked my way up to Senior Programmatic Manager. In the company I’ve got a golden reputation - they even put together a business case to promote me again. But the truth is, I’m burnt out. I regularly work 50+ hours a week, constantly firefighting client problems, reprioritising deadlines, and managing a team. It’s been draining for years, but I kept pushing myself to ‘just try harder’.

6 months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly it all made sense:

* Why constant interruptions and overstimulation leave me overwhelmed
* Why I struggle with organisation and juggling multiple deadlines
* Why I do my best work when I can hyperfocus on one thing at a time
* And why, despite the chaos, my detail and intuition have kept me afloat

The problem is: this environment brings out my biggest ADHD challenges, not my strengths. I feel like I’m surviving, not thriving. And honestly, I’m scared that if I take the promotion, it’ll just push me closer to a breakdown.

What I *think* I want: smaller team, calmer environments, remote or WFH balance, time for deep focus without constant interruptions, better Work/life balance.

I’m torn between staying in the industry but moving to a calmer role (ad ops, analyst, or freelance) vs. retraining for something completely different (gardening/landscaping, working with dogs, psychology-related work - I studied psych at uni and loved it).

My biggest worry is financial. I’m saving for a wedding, and can’t afford to start from scratch on minimum wage. But if I don’t change now, I fear I’ll get stuck.

Has anyone here been in a similar position? How did you manage to pivot into something that better suited your ADHD brain - without setting your life back financially?

2025-09-17 05:06:05;My ADHD medication journey;"I, a 19 year old female, was recently diagnosed with ADHD that causes anxiety and depression. I’ve been treated for anxiety my whole life and the medication has worked (Lexapro) however I am not having the same luck with treating ADHD and was wondering if anyone could help me out on if this is normal and what to do. 

I started with 10mg adderall XR. I immediately noticed a difference and I was upped to eventually 30mg. After a few weeks of taking the 30mg, I noticed that the medication lasted no where near how long it should have been and I was having a major crash early in the evening. My psychiatrist then switched me to 15mg of IR twice a day. It is the same, if not worse. She then decided to put me on Wellbutrin as it could be my depression symptoms taking over. I have not been on Wellbutrin long enough to notice the effects fully yet, but so far there is not change in my mood. 

I was experiencing what life was like to actually feel motivation for the first time ever, only for it to fade away pretty rapidly, which I now realize was only the first stages of the medication being introduced to my body. The XR lasted me maybe four or so hours while each IR pill lasts me 2 or so hours. I can tell that the medication does work very little as I am completing schoolwork much sooner than usual (I’m a big procrastinator), but other tasks still seem too overwhelming. I am having a hard time in college and I rarely go anywhere other than class, as it is all I can force myself to do.

I have tried Ritalin and Vyvanse and while they helped with productivity and focus, they made my anxiety much worse. It also made my emotional dysregulation much worse to the point where I was very volatile and I felt like I was going crazy. I am currently on guanfacine, bupropion and recently Qelbree. I was on guanfacine, bupropion and buspirone and that was my favorable drug combination but I was always tired and sluggish. I was calm but maybe too calm.

2025-09-16 17:12:21;First time posting on this sub, had to get something off my chest.;"For context, I haven't been formally diagnosed with ADHD(I'm working on it), but I do exhibit a lot of traits that I recognise in my ADHD aunt.




I tried to talk to my parents about what I think are my legitimate issues, and I said to my dad that I know he and my mom think I'm being lazy on purpose and he immediately told me that I was, and then I said I feel overwhelmed when I think about all the things I have to do like cleaning the kitchen and the living room and the dining room, and I just don't feel like they understood what I was saying, and then my mom said I was just making excuses. 

I think I have ADHD and I've been trying to advocate for myself more and I kind of feel a little demoralised. I kind of feel guilty about it now because it's not that I want to be lazy, I just genuinely have a hard time pushing myself into doing something. 



I feel insanely guilty whenever someone does something for me, and it can be as simple as someone hanging up my clothes. Whenever someone gives me a gift, I feel like I don't deserve it because in my head I'm this awful person who doesn't deserve nice things, and compliments confuse me because how dare someone say something nice to me?



Another point of guilt/shame for me is when I know I have to/must do something that realistically I am able to do, but I can't just ever bring myself to actually do the thing, so I end up just leaving it, and when someone calls me on it, like my mom for instance, and they ask me why I didn't do such and such, I don't know how to answer why I didn't do it because realistically it wouldn't have even been that hard to do it, so I default to answering with 'I don't know', and that sets off a whole argument and discussion about how lazy I am and my lack of drive, and it makes me feel like utter shit.



So here I am again, it's currently 3:58 am, can't go to sleep, probably won't be able to go to sleep, I told myself I was going to go to sleep an hour ago but I didn't. Now I'm going to be up for half the day, probably most or all morning, get a few things done, get tired, go to sleep, and then wake up to my mom yelling at me about how the day time is for being awake and night time is for sleep like I don't already know that.

2025-09-16 16:39:11;Please give a newly enMESHED in ADHD middle age woman some hacks;That says it all - I have probably always had this diagnosis or been neurodivergent in some way. I'm in my late 40s now and fully diagnosed and undergoing treatment. I've struggled with relationships, substances, careers, family my whole life. I have taken things personally since day 1, but I consider (or maybe considerED?) myself highly intelligent. I've had ups and downs in my life - sometimes I am the queen of the ball and sometimes I have been the biggest scumbag you'll ever know. All people, if you make it this long, can say this. But, these are all signs of ADHD (full disclaimer - not going there with the bi- this and bi- that and 'disorder' and blah blah diagnoses in the DSM). Sorry, I'm not those and I've tried most and I am a little resentful, so my apologies. That's another subject. Anyways you all probably know that estrogen is involved with ADHD and it DROPS at my age, I cannot do a day and accomplish one thing to the life of me, one thing that I set out to do, so mostly I focus on cleaning and I think that in and of itself has become a 'disorder' if you will. Kidding, it's a coping mechanism for sure. I still get things done EVENTUALLY. I'm still a good marathoner and artist and garderner and things, but everything else has changed. I was a very competent professional and now I can't focus because 'SQUIRREL.' Anything distracts me from task at hand, anything. My day, though not unpleasant, rambles on and loops around this way and my friends have mostly given up on me. One more thing and then I want your hacks or advice or relatibility...this seemed to start really spiraling when I lost my job last November. I've not worked since and my 'job' each day is to study for what is supposed to be the hardest professional exam there is. I've passed two sections, but now I simply 'CANNOT STUDY.'

2025-09-16 07:08:06;Can ADHD lead to “periods” that are worse than others?;"I (F 21), have previously been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified Mood Disorder, Inattentive ADHD, and Unspecified Trauma Disorder. The only thing that different professionals seem to agree on is that I have anxiety. The ADHD specifically is what different professional seem to disagree on the most.

I originally was tested for ADHD on my college campus, where a neuropsych test conducted by a grad student concluded that I don’t have ADHD, but just GAD. I already was diagnosed with this about a year prior by my first therapist.

About a year later, my second and current therapist recommended that I get a second opinion on ADHD. Her and her son both are diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, and she said that many of my symptoms relating to struggling with time management, focus, and task-paralysis seemed familiar to her experiences. Previous to her recommendation of me getting a second opinion about the ADHD she had only diagnosed me with GAD, and eventually Unspecified Trauma Disorder. She however does not have the qualifications to diagnose ADHD.

I ended up taking an online test through “ADHD Online”. Here I was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD, Unspecified Mood Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. This test was self reported though, so it is hard for me to trust it- it was just what was manageable for me financially.

I ended up seeking out a psychiatrist eventually to try medication. I was prescribed Vyvanse, which I didn’t react well to. It did help me to be more productive, but it gave me anger issues. I had some nights where I did not sleep at all and didn’t feel super tired after, and I remember people saying that I seemed angry. I also drove more aggressively I think, so I quit the medication because I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I was able to get more school work done though, and it made my relationship with food better. 

When I was talking to my psychiatrist the other day about how I have periods of time where I struggle to get out of bed, struggle with hygiene, have task paralysis, etc., she said that I can’t have ADHD since ADHD is something you always have and not something that you periodically have. While I know that this is of course true since if you have ADHD it is consistent, I feel like if a person with ADHD also has depression it would make sense for their executive functioning to still be periodically worse? I also told her that my time management has been getting better, and she told me that’s another reason that I can’t have ADHD because a person with ADHD wouldn’t be able to be on time. I told her that often when I am on time it is because I overcompensate by waking up 2.5 hours early, and that I skip things like eating breakfast and washing my face when need be to make sure that I am on time, because I used to struggle with being chronically late. She said that someone with ADHD wouldn’t be able to overcompensate.

I was now prescribed Wellbutrin for depression, but I’m really scared that I am going to react badly and become manic or something, (I know mania isn’t a part of ADHD but I genuinely don’t know what I am struggling with at this point). 

TL;DR
My Psychiatrist says that I don’t have ADHD because I am able to arrive to things on time, and I have periods where I struggle more with executive functioning, (and ADHD is consistent, not periodic). Can someone with ADHD still have “highs and lows” where they struggle to function more than other periods of their life?";r/adhd_anxiety;2;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ni15w3/can_adhd_lead_to_periods_that_are_worse_than/
2025-09-14 10:44:18;switching meds in the same family;"Hey everyone,

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and have tried a handful of meds over time Adderall IR, Adderall XR, methylphenidate, and dexmethylphenidate and honestly, I haven’t noticed much if any improvement with any of them.

The only thing I do feel is maybe a bit ""medicated"" like there’s *something* in my system but my actual ADHD symptoms (focus issues, procrastination, racing thoughts, mental fog, etc.) are still very much there. No real clarity, no productivity boost, nothing like what some people describe.

I’m wondering:  
Has anyone had success just switching formulations within the same med family? Like from Adderall IR to XR or Vyvanse, or Ritalin to Focalin or Concerta and then suddenly it clicked?

2025-09-13 07:08:21;question about my adderall😞;"hello, i am 25 F diagnosed with hyperactive ADHD, anxiety, depression, & PTSD, and i would say for me its on a scale of 1-10 it’s a 7. my psychiatrist prescribed me 7.5mg IR x2 daily in the morning and at lunch. i have such a love hate thing with my medication though. it’s really getting to me and making me feel like i need to choose between quiet, productive, calm, still, “smarter & confident” me or just being myself. 

over the course of a little over a year i’ve noticed when im on my meds i can “see” better and focus and complete tasks in a very timely manner. oh and im also a SAHM of 2 toddlers, it helps me so much with basic chores such as dishes (always struggle with them), picking up stuff in a timely manner when it’s not in its place to avoid a lot of clutter. i don’t interrupt people much at all and i just sound very calm and more “professional” & more “adulty”. i do have a big problem with task initiation and that scares me because i need to be in constant alert for 2 toddlers and a husband who works long hours. 

but sometimes it feels like my medication is just a “fake” version of me like what i wish i could be but still with my original personality and creativity and funniness. and sometimes it makes me depressed and/or guilty. i notice that when NOT on medication i do my hobbies that i enjoy and just feel my emotions which i find as a strength because i care deeply about my close friends and family. i am so torn on if i should just take my meds when absolutely needed like if the house is just an absolute wreck or i just don’t know what to do. 

ive been taking it daily for a little over 1 year and i just feel like ive lost a bit of my creativity and enjoying my hobbies but i absolutely love the motivation, focus and how clean ive been keeping my house for my kids. so sorry but my question should i just take as needed because it really does help and i want to be the best mom i can be to my children but i still want to feel like myself and enjoy hobbies and be silly sometimes not so serious.

2025-09-11 03:36:35;Meds and tips after diagnosis;"Hi everyone,
I just got my first proper prescription for ADHD which is 10mg Medikinet CR once a day. I have a diagnosis now but I want to be fully open; 
I misused stimulants before, both ADHD meds and other stuff. At my worst I was cramming for exams on ridiculous doses, and for years I also loved to smoke some snoop’s special . I know it wasn’t healthy and I crossed the line into addiction.

Right now I’m 2 weeks clean and starting meds the right way while also attending group addiction therapy sessions being under a doctor’s guidance there too. I am really trying to stay disciplined and avoid slipping back into old patterns like “eh, I’m tired, I’ll just pop a pill” . That mindset was exactly how I abused them before and I don’t want to repeat that.

The dose feels very light so far , pretty much nothing maybe I fidget bit less but mentally I don’t feel much difference. I know this process is about patience and working with my psychiatrist, but I’d really like to hear from people here who have been through it:
        1. How did you realize when your dose was  “sweet spot”? Were there clear signs it was helping but not too much?
       2. What improvements did you notice first ? Fidgeting, distractibility, emotional regulation, focus?
      3. How do you manage the crash at the end of the day?
	4. If you’ve tried different long-acting versions (like Medikinet vs Concerta/Atenzo), how did they feel different for you in terms of stability and side effects ?
       5. How is your experience with tolerance, and the starting „magical effects” of the right dose stayed with you or was it fading away with time? Do breaks or some cycle like 5days on 2 days off help with it, or shouldn’t I be bothered about this at all?

I want to do this properly and not treat meds like a shortcut or a crutch for every little discomfort. I’m committed to sticking with my doctor’s plan, but it would mean a lot to hear how you all figured out what works for you.
Thanks in advance for all your replies, really appreciate :)

2025-09-10 03:15:39;I feel like there is something more to me than just ADHD;"I got my ADHD diagnosis around May of this year and it felt like such a relief to finally know why I wasn't ""belonging"" to other people. Now that some time has passed and I learned more about my disorder it seems like I might have more than just ADHD. I'm not entirely sure what it could be or if it even is a disorder I'm not aware of. That's why I'm asking here for help finding out what it might be. Some stuff I've noticed that I am not aware of being a trait of ADHD are:

1. I react with anger/anxiety to sudden and unexpected changes (even if they are minor). For example - today I was in school and I went to the classroom where the next lesson was supposed to take place. I headed to the seat I always sit but someone already sat there. I tried arguing with them but they didn't want to switch seats. I felt like I was about to cry and I was in a bad moon for the rest of that lesson.
2. Social situations are tiring. Even when I go out with my friends I feel a bit forced to go out. Don't get me wrong, I love them and I would be miserable without them. Though the ammount of times they asked me to go out and I felt like I had to agree to be nice is pretty big.
3. I panic very easily. I can't tell you how many times I've started crying because I couldn't find something and then found it after a quick search. I'm slowly learning to control it but it's very energy-consuming.
4. I am very terrified of dirt. To be more exact - ""human"" uncleanness and sticky and smelly substancess. This consists of foods that make your hands get a scent or become oily, dirt in public transport, money and probably something more I forgot to put here. I am pretty chill about mold or other stuff that are natural (unless I start to get paranoid about the food I ate being moldy). This fear has intensified after and during the pandemic.

These are some things I've felt that had some relevancy to my question. Obviously I'm not asking for a full blown diagnosis but a nudge in a direction.

2025-09-09 10:23:06;Diagnosed with Dyspraxia: Worth a Second Opinion for ADHD?;"Hiya! I'm looking for some advice I was unable to receive on the Dyspraxia subreddit. Please let me know if this isn't allowed and it'll be removed right away! Also apologies for the length:

A few weeks ago, I (24M) concluded my Neurodiversity assessment under a clinical psychologist, and was diagnosed solely with DCD/Dyspraxia. I've always had poor motor skills (shoe laces, buttons, arts/crafts  woodwork, physical education especially. Terrible with sports.

The assessment was overall confusing as Dyspraxia was a minor focus of assessment, and also the struggles I largely experience seem to perhaps not be Dyspraxia related. I've seen a lot of recorded secondary symptoms that have ADHD crossover. I thought I'd list notable symptoms and hopefully gauge whether this is feasibly exclusive within Dyspraxia:

* Inattentiveness - If someone's talking to me, I spend a lot of energy trying to focus on what they're saying. I can have trouble with zoning out, and coming to when I suddenly have to engage again (it's not as dramatic as I put it but definitely a factor). Following instructions is mostly difficult. I'm very disorganized and a bit messy at times, which carries into work - I spend most of the time daydreaming and it's not uncommon to catch myself making a careless mistake, or walk a lap and not actually intend on going anywhere.

* Restlessness - I'm not hyperactive, although have moments if I'm on a roll. I have a difficult time unwinding and relaxing, without having thoughts on how I should be doing something more important. I feel like lots of normal things/hobbies for people are boring to me, and I need to do more exciting, 'big' things to feel happy with my life. My very active mind has also led to a lot of unhelpful rumination (past bad decisions/mistakes and experiences), which is very draining, like I'm constantly policing myself. I am also incredibly fidgety when I'm sitting down or standing in one spot, and often pace.

* Emotional Dysregulation/RSD? - Although I'd say I can be emotionally mature, I can be a bit short fused too. Not yelling (and that fuse extends significantly out in public/with friends), but inconveniences in something I'm trying to do, or plans having to be interrupted or changed annoy me greatly. I am sensitive to criticism and really try to work on that. When I was a kid, I always was scared of having friends over because I was nervous they would like the other kids more and ultimately wish I was more like them. I guess that's kind of RSD? Or somewhat abandonment issues maybe, but it has definitely followed me growing up (into relationships as well). Also if I hurt a close friend or a loved one, I sit and ruminate on it for a really long time. I really struggle to get over it. 

* Forgetfulness - I do have a great memory and never struggled with assignment deadlines (though I procrastinate soooo much now), appointments or scheduled outings. However, I absolutely misplace my belongings around the house lots. I lost quite a few jackets growing up as a kid. My workaround right now is to dump all my belongings in a bag, and as you'd imagine, that bag is a mess. Sometimes, I also forget about or stop tasks mid-way through, like finished laundry still in the machine. 

I do apologize for the information dump and to anyone reading this, I do appreciate it very much. Technically it was concluded I didn't have ADHD, but is there any merit to getting a second opinion? I understand no one can say for sure but just wanted some external perspectives outside of myself.

while I finally went through the process and ended up getting diagnosed.

I went to my GP, showed them the full results, got prescribed Dex, and am now on a waitlist to get in with a psychiatrist. And even though I did everything above board (no getting diagnosed by TikTok) I still feel like a fraud because I don’t relate to every symptom described by every single person whose account I’ve heard.

2025-09-08 18:50:30;Thinking of getting tested for ADHD;"Unsure if I am able to post here but I thought I'd give it a shot, just to see what others think.

My son recently has been diagnosed with ADHD and was taking Vyvanse. During the process of filling out forms with the School and the Pediatrician, a lot of the questions and answers that I was giving felt very much like how I was during his age, and how I still feel now.

I am now 36, have never studied, but I am married, have a house 2 kids and a stable job. But I have always felt something is there, something mentally stopping me, for example, I find it hard to commit, e.g. I've attempted certifications to progress my career, I really want to finish said certifications, but I cannot, even if I am enjoying it. I find minor things can trigger me, to the point I will blow up and other arounds me are generally left thinking WTF just happened. Also, I generally need 5-10 breaks to get me through the day. I am by no means making that up!!

I can keep going with examples, and what similarities I have with my son, but there are to many to list.

My Sister, has been going through a similar process with her children, but she has never had the same struggles I have. After speaking with her, she suggested, why not try Vyvanse as you have a bit left over (my son had issues with this, we are trying him on Ritalin). I hummed, and sat on it for a week after reading up about it, and I don't like taking things that are not prescribed to me as I always taught that.

I eventually tried it over 2 days, and the effects I noticed;

My wife calling out for me, and I was able to respond immediately. I generally don't hear my name!

At work, there is another ""Andrew"" which is my name, and I heard my name being called at least 5 times. Generally I wouldn't hear it Brain fog / general clutter seemed to be not there.

I generally have 2-3 things on my mind any given time. Just silence and I could focus on one thing / task at hand

Reading documentation at work seemed so easy.

The ""on call"" after hours phone rang, and for once I didn't have a melt down which generally happens I felt like I was able to run a little slow and still get tasks done Forgetfulness didn’t seem as bad

2025-09-07 09:39:52;Frustrated trying to figure out what's happening to me;"Context (sorta): diagnosed adhd and currently trying to figure out if I have anxiety with my doctor. I experience some social anxiety(very shy as a kid) but I don't necessarily ""act"" shy, I just avoid situations entirely/get overwhelmed and shut down and spend the entire time leading up to said uncomfortable situation I'm anticipating, just obsessing over how anxious I feel about it. I don't know if that's just feeling self conscious? Because I feel hyper aware of myself/ appearance, though I know logically, no one cares. This was my first week back to school, in my second year of uni, so there's a good chance I'm just having trouble dealing with the normal amount of stress that school comes with. 

The only thing that make me feel otherwise is that, recently I have been spending near entire days just cleaning my house, because if I don't, I feel almost like, neurotic? The month before school started I would come home from work etc, and immediately clean the kitchen and it was sort of soothing. If one of my family members were using the kitchen i genuinely felt overwhelmed and couldn't do anything while I waited for them to be done. I don't know if this is anxiety or adhd or what.

Yesterday i got home from school and cleaned my entire house for 4 hours before my friends came over, not because I wanted it to be clean for them, but I just couldn't stop and I nearly cancelled on them because I felt like I just needed to keep cleaning. I felt like I had to vomit and was on the verge of tears. I generally keep a tidy space and I don't know why I'm doing this. 

This could 100% just be stress cleaning, which I do before I have friends over anyways, but this past month I have felt genuine distress over cleaning, both when thinking about how/ what I need to clean when I get home, and then during cleaning, thinking about how I can make sure everything is clean and like steps ex: can't vacuum then wipe tables because crumbs/dust might get on the clean floor, have to sweep the floors every time I'm done doing another task.  

If you made it this far and have experienced anything similar, any insights/tips/personal experiences would be appreciated :D";r/adhd_anxiety;7;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1nags20/frustrated_trying_to_figure_out_whats_happening/

What started as a constant need to shake my legs whilst seated (still severe) has now turned into some serious toe twitching and toe rubbing. I had no idea this was a thing, looked it up and the term was “cricketing”.  It’s a form of stimming from what I understand.

2025-09-05 20:44:55;Vyvanse makes rumination and overthinking worse?;"​I've been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety (specifically, rumination and overthinking). I was first prescribed Ritalin, but it made me feel irritable and aggressive. After a while, my doctor switched me to Vyvanse, starting at 20 mg and then increasing to 30 mg. At first, it felt like a miracle. My mind was so calm. I had an incredible awareness of my thoughts, actions, and behavior, and my decision-making was significantly improved.

​This lasted for about two weeks. The effect wasn't as potent as it was initially (I know I was experiencing the ""honeymoon period""), but it was still decent. Everything was fine until my life became very stressful and I went through some bad experiences.

​After that period, I was still on Vyvanse, but whenever I took it, I became highly anxious, irritable, and depressed, ruminating and overthinking every second of the day. I experienced the most intense emotions and the worst mood swings. I lowered the dose to 20 mg, but nothing changed. I increased it to 40 mg, and things got even worse.

​Eventually, I decided to stop taking Vyvanse. My withdrawal symptoms were gone after one week, and I felt much better after two weeks. It's now been more than a month. I still ruminate and overthink, but not nearly as much as I did on the medication. I also no longer have the intense mood swings. I'm back to how I was before medication, but I know I won't be able to function properly for college like this.

​My doctor says we should treat my anxiety first, but I haven't had a good experience with SSRIs. I've researched guanfacine and clonidine, as they seem to help regulate the side effects of stimulants.

​I feel stuck right now and was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences with Vyvanse or other stimulants.";r/adhd_anxiety;31;11;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1n94a9p/vyvanse_makes_rumination_and_overthinking_worse/
2025-09-05 08:07:39;My thesis has been holding me hostage for the past 1.5 years.;"I feel like a failure. I am a failure actually.

I always had a plan. I knew what I was gonna do. I always knew what secondary school I was gonna pick, what package of subjects I wanted. I knew four years beforehand what college program I wanted to get into. And once I got in at 17, I knew what specific track I'd apply for in my second year.

But not I am 21 years old. I dreamed of writing my thesis not only about something I studied, but something about the world or something that highlighted the societal topics problems my university wanted to avoid (like Palestine). I had big plans for myself, and I still have them somewhere deep down.

And then came my thesis actually came. I was already barely getting by from year to year. I think it's because I wasn’t being micromanaged by teachers. I had to do all the readings, the planning, the preparations by myself. And I felt so lonely in the process. Moving out meant I was so far away from my friends and my friendships slowly withered with distance. I had a hard time making new friends. I feel so misunderstood. I feel like I am failing my own expectations and the expectations of my parents, my little sisters, my friends. I was supposed to be the smart kid. The prepared kid. The one who loved debates and politics and complex societal issues.

I’m the oldest sister in an immigrant household. I have two little sisters who are my world. They look up to me. I have a mother who sees me as her pride, her educational pride. I’m the first with the privilege to go to university in Europe. And my parents sacrificed so much money to give me this opportunity. I had to claw every step of the way since I moved out and started uni. But then this thesis came.

The worst thing is I have ADHD on top of anxiety, and I feel like my ADHD made the anxiety worse. Getting an official diagnosis was already a struggle. Now everything is crumbling. The thesis itself, but also the fact that I have to pay extra tuition. My parents couldn’t afford more than they already had, so now I have to pay for myself. I already did one extra year, and now I have to do another and it's soo humiliating.

Every time I try to open the laptop to write my thesis, I’m scared what I’ll do will be horrible. It's gotten to the point I can't even keep the tab open. It's like a sickening pit in my stomach and vomit in my throat. My entire body freezes. That for 1.5 years.

I drown myself in TV shows to escape from the world but its not working anymore. I keep wanting to run away when I've always been the confrontational person. People used to tell me I have no fear. That I was the crazy person that will say shit in your face no matter how hard. That I never back down from a fight.

If that isn't who I am, who even am I? Who is this person that is so afraid that I now can't even send out resumes, because I am not good enough anyways? That is so ashamed to even admit to people I did in fact not graduate?

Anxiety is ruining me. Ruining the image I had of myself. Ruining whatever plans I once had. I don’t know what I am anymore and I am so afraid to find out. I'm afraid of people, afraid of the future. My life feels frozen. I’m stuck, and I don’t know how to get out.";r/adhd_anxiety;13;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1n8qhoi/my_thesis_has_been_holding_me_hostage_for_the/
2025-09-05 00:09:49;I just got (re)officially diagnosed at 40. I am so mad.;I was diagnosed when I was 16. But when I was 17 after numerous mental health issues I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and was told the ADHD was a misdiagnosis. I've been taking medication for Bipolar disorder this whole time, but I never felt like I was stable. My house is a mess, I spend all my money on stupid shit, never went to college because I can't retain any information at all, many toxic relationships, a couple stints in rehab, I'm in a constant state of anxiety and unfinished ideas and projects. The psychologist said if I was properly diagnosed and taking medication for the ADHD this whole time life might of been a little bit easier. I am so thankful that I finally got diagnosed because now hopefully I can understand my brain a little bit better but part of me is pissed about all those years feeling like something was wrong and not being able to pinpoint it.

2025-09-04 14:44:05;choosing weed over adhd meds?;ik that sounds like a dumb question but hear me out. im a 20 year old about to enter my second year of college as an engineering student and this summer ive been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety leading to me isolating in my room. ive also felt completely numb to emotions for years and ive definitely had some level of dissociation from reality. anyways, i recently noticed about 4 days ago that when i smoke weed alone it helps me feel emotions clearer, work through my thoughts, feel grounded in reality, and just generally helps me feel real. this has lead to me making tiny improvements in my own life and my relationship with my mom and brother is better (i can have genuine conversations and ill do nice things for them). ive been spending less time on my phone scrolling, my screen time went down from like 8 hour average to 4, and ive been actually learning about things im interested in. im still not being super productive, but at least its getting me off my ass and i have motivation, plus i actually get to enjoy my days which feels really relieving. VS the effect that adhd meds have had on me since i got diagnosed in april: the first day i take them i feel like i can finally change my life and turn it around and do all these tasks like a robot but then the next days i feel more dissociated and i just get lazier and more depressed. i haven’t taken them in almost a month. and ive been on adderall, concerta, and now my drs trying dexo-something before he can give me vyvanse. so anyways weed feels like it works way better for me than adhd meds mostly just because i get some sort of enjoyment from life. and when im enjoying life its easier to do the boring mundane tasks. also, ik it might sound like i need an anti anxiety med, but i actually think weed could be better because it feels like im almost healing myself with it on a mental and spiritual level instead of whatever synthetic thing anxiety meds would do. like i come to some pretty intense realizations about my life when im high. but idk maybe thats all in my head. im pretty confident it isn’t though. but yeah ;r/ADHDers;2;22;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n82yoe/choosing_weed_over_adhd_meds/

I’ve noticed that the older I get, the more I hate being a slave to the system, I hate having to work 40 hours a week to live (recoup) for two days… this just feels wrong, this isn’t the way we were meant to live. I want to have the free time to bake, and swim and camp and cook and spend time with my loved ones. Instead I spend 40 hours a week at a computer and my husband spends 40+ hours a week breaking his body in a blue collar job and we have nothing to show for it other than the bags under our eyes.

2025-09-03 17:48:40;How ADHD meds have affected my life;"Me (m17) just got diagnosed with ADHD and have been using Methylphenidate (medikinet) 40mg for five days now.  Most noticable effets are better ability to focus, circus in my went quieter, I have much less anxienty, I think less negatively about my self, my self-esteem is not as low as it used to be. And overcoming andh paralysis is so much easier.

I don't feel like doing my usual dopamine hit things as much(scrollin through social media, eating sugar and beating my meat)

Thing that I sadly relised is that meds won't change my life alone I have to do lot of work myself. I am still masking at shcool and everywhere else except home, still late for everything, still afeard to socialise,I still get distracted and still addicted to my phone

Meds have some side effects too . I have loss of appetite, hart rate little bit high, can' sleep and my head is confused after the effect wores of. and i have hard time falling asleep.

For context I have always known that I have adhd and got diacnosis because I was failing in shcool and had the above mentiond symptons that are now smaller.

After I raduate from high shcool I am gonna quit the meds because I have to do my mandatory military service, so do anybody have tips to function without them as best as possible?

And Can anyone relate to my experience

Ps. sorry for all the grammar errors I know I suck I have never really tried in shcool



Edit: I am going to answer the most common suggestions. My doctor said that the side effects should be gone in two weeks and I was able to sleep last nigth just fine. My hart rate is higher than usual but not too high so I am not concerned. Also I have never really liked eating because I have to eat so much sence I do lot of sports.";r/ADHDers;7;9;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n7aheb/how_adhd_meds_have_affected_my_life/

2025-09-03 11:51:35;Can ADHD ever be outgrown?;"From late elementary school to early in high school, I (18F) believe that I showed many symptoms of Inattentive ADHD, quite possibly enough to receive a diagnosis. I had a hard time turning in assignments on time, a hard time focusing in school, and occasionally in conversations. I also frequently lost/forgot things like jackets and waterbottles as a child, and have memories of my mom telling me that I needed to get better at time management.

Anyway, when I was in high school, my symptoms seem to have slowly started to...disappear? My focus has become much better, I turn in most of my assignments on time, I don't really seem to forget items, etc., etc. Maybe I still have symptoms, and I don't realize it, but I really don't seem to anymore.

Also:

1. I read a post here on Reddit once on an ADHD-related forum (I don't remember whether it was this one or not) that discussed whether or not ADHD could be outgrown. Someone said that they once believed that they had outgrown it. But then, they went to college, and they realized that they hadn't, and that their environment had simply been ADHD-friendly. They specifically described their high school as having 40-minute long classes, and most assignments were due the next day. I find this to be eerily similar to my high school. I'm currently a part-time student at a community college online, and I've been doing well so far. But maybe that's still a stable enough environment? I also still live at home, if that's significant.
2. I am most likely autistic, and I know that that can cause executive dysfunction as well. That said, there is also a massive overlap between the two conditions.

What do you guys think? I would love to hear your opinions. Also, I can totally add more detail to this if you guys want to, although I probably won't be able to look at this again until tomorrow night.";r/ADHDers;7;26;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n74oxm/can_adhd_ever_be_outgrown/

2025-09-02 22:03:12;Adhd questions;"So i was diagnosed with adhd when i was 12. My parents were confused why this kid knows everything about history, mechanics, physics, biology, do mental experiments and play sports, but he cannot get grades in school anymore.

I was always told i’m very smart as a kid, i knew stuff most adults didn’t. I would fix stuff my parents wanted to throw away. I knew about napoleon’s victories at 10, i knew Leonard Davinci’s most famous painting and could name all the ppl in it. I could do maths mentally, i read Churchill’s books and debated on politics with adults. I could literally talk about anything but i just couldn’t study at school. Not that i didn’t want to but because i wanted to do smth more interesting and something more complex.

When i was diagnosed with adhd, they performed at IQ test which was for 16 year old ( they didn’t have those for 12 year olds) and i scored 136. That gave me an ego boost that maybe i was a genius. Procrastination ruined me. Everyone around me also used to talk how handsome i was (i’m sorry for saying this) this was led me into having some sort of complex that no matter what i’ll land somewhere in life and things won’t be hard for me in life.

Fast forward to this day(M21), i’v failed my Alevel’s and i’m on gap year and i feel like loser because everyone around me is somewhere while i’m not. I try to study and work hard but i cannot put in the hours and i know i have the potential to do good in life but i cannot study. It’s hard for me to focus and have an adequate attention span. I know i can learn stuff quick and grasp the knowledge but i keep putting it off.

The doctors first gave me ‘Aripiprazole’ but that did more damage than relief. It made me aggressive and gave me anger outbursts. Which i never had before.

Then i was prescribed ‘atomoxetine’ which went well for a few months until they started adverse effects too. I still rmbr the first time i had those and went to school i noticed how attentive i was towards the teacher and how focused i was. I was actually being productive rather than being disruptive and unruly. That was the first time i realised and said to myself, damn i actually do have adhd. However a few months later i started to realise that i was slower than i was before. My thinking was blurry and i stopped talking like i used to. I wasn’t as witty and energetic as i used to be. I wasn’t having the fun i used to and it was making me depressive. I started having panic attacks in the following weeks and they started increasing until i stopped eating them.

I’v recently been prescribed Ritalin, they don’t affect my personality, however they don’t have the same affect as atomoxetine did on me. I don’t really feel any different with those. I do have a crash a few hours later which i didn’t with atomoxetine.

I’m ending this with a question on wether anyone in this sub can relate to what i just said; being smart but not productive, knowing stuff other people don’t but being a lazy student and most importantly did you ever feel like helpless and wanting to just quit? If that happens what helps you cope and be productive.";r/ADHDers;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n6kcva/adhd_questions/

2025-09-02 05:34:13;Fairly new to diagnosis and Vyvanse... Need opinions;"Hey y'all. I'm 50 (as of yesterday) and was diagnosed with ADHD 3 months ago. 

I wish I would have thought to get tested long ago because life may have been different, but oh well. 

I started on Vyvanse 20mg and have worked up to Vyvanse 50mg. I've had the 50mg for a month now. Dr appt tomorrow morning. 

What I've noticed was that my first week of Vyvanse was like actually being aware and alive for the first time in my life. My brain was able to finish thoughts. I could tackle a chore and actually finish it. I was no longer just chaotic, I was organized and chaotic yet nowhere near AS chaotic. 

I started focusing on one thing at a time and making plans for the next tasks at future times. 

I felt like I was almost where I needed to be. My only real issue was that it felt like my meds wore off kinda early. So I was upped from 40mg to 50mg. 

This past month, I haven't had much of the motivation. I don't feel like I'm focusing as well. I want to. I can open the notes app and make the lists. But I don't feel like actually completing those lists when the time comes. My brain feels a little more unfocused (even though it's focused, it's trying to focus on too many things at once and it's unable to do it well) 

My energy level on 20 and 40mg was great. On 50mg... It seems all in my head. No physical movement unless I actually force myself to get going and then it's still a slow start. 

At my last appointment, the Dr mentioned that they won't do booster doses with Vyvanse. If I felt like my meds weren't lasting long enough, then they'd switch me to something else. 

I'm scared of losing what I have. I like how things were going other than it not lasting long enough. 

Is the 50mg too high for me and that's why I don't feel like I'm as focused or productive? Or should i somehow see if the Dr will go higher? I don't want her to think I'm pushing for a max dose. She already seemed wary of my getting 50mg. 

This is honestly my first and only medication for this and maybe I'm just overanxious about it all, but I really really don't want to go backwards. I'm so enjoying the little bit I've been able to handle in life lately. Especially before this last 30 days. I accomplished so many things that I've put off for years. That's definitely a win in my book. 

I believe the other name she tossed around that could potentially have a 2 times a day dose was dyanavel but I could be wrong. She is hesitant to prescribe things without knowing me more, which I totally understand. I also have severe anxiety that has prevented me from being a functioning person outside of my home for over 20 years. That, combined with depression for as long as I can remember. I don't know if those things have anything to do with it, but she talks to me a lot about those things and then makes her decision about my monthly prescription. 

I see her tomorrow morning and I'm just not sure if I should tell her that I didn't feel the same this last month, or if I should keep quiet and try another month of it.

The reason I'm posting here is because over this past month, he went off at me for the most random reasons (some I admit I deserved, some I still can't comprehened) and it's always the same pattern:

1. I screw something up (either for real or in his eyes)
2. He gets mad, calls me names or shuts me out for half a day
3. I go quiet and go do my thing instead (work, gym, bike)
4. He comes back acting like nothing happened.

Examples: 

* I accidentally washed his cycling clothes with softener because he left them in the washing machine and I didn't think to check before throwing my stuff in. Completely my fault, I offered to replace everything later. When he realized what happened he went completely non-verbal and wouldn't talk to me until the next morning.
* Again, stupid mistake but the door handle on his door had been hanging on by a thread for a few months. A week ago either I pulled on it and didn't notice until the morning or the cat jumped on it but basically, he woke up and realized we were locked out. He swore at me for several minutes until he unlocked it with a credit card.
* I was at a friend's birthday party and asked him if he wanted to come for a bit because everyone was excited to meet him. He came and after a while lashed out at me for ""touching him three times in ten minutes"" and left. I wasn't groping him or anything, just had my hand on his thigh because I thought it was a nice gesture since he didn't know anybody there. 
* I was looking after his cat and he (the cat) ate the humidity absorbing packet from his treats that I didn't even know were there (so he must've left the empty packet somewhere in the room) - again, he lashed out at me, said we had to keep an eye out at him because he didn't know when it happened but then he went cycling anyway.

It's always stuff like this - some things are serious, some are straight up dumb but I never know how he's going to react. I never know if it's okay to touch him or not and some reactions don't make sense to me no matter how hard I try to understand. I admit, I often retreat to my room or go take a walk so I don't say things in anger. But then he starts texting/calling me? I tried explaining how I felt and that I wasn't sure if I could exist in this environment but he told me I also had mental issues because I was reacting this way to his blowups :D 

Is there even a way to set healthy boundaries in this situation?";r/adhd_anxiety;4;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1n5whwb/me_and_bf_both_diagnosed_i_cant_seem_to_settrust/

2025-09-01 10:56:38;I’m worried I “enjoy” my adhd meds too much???;"I have mentioned this to my doctor but just wanna get some other opinions/experiences from people to reassure myself lol. I’d really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and give input! Not looking for medical advice at all just curious if this experience is “normal”

I’m 21 f and have been diagnosed since I was 13. It’s extremely clear I have adhd, and also was diagnosed with Autism recently.

I went on and off meds in my teens for various reasons but started again as an adult. First I was on focalin but it kinda felt like “too much” for lack of a better word and I’ve been on Ritalin since, for about 2 years or so. I have ocd and anxiety so I overthink and overanalyze everything and am constantly paranoid I’m “enjoying” the effect of the stimulant too much or am addicted or something.

I hate when I have not had my meds and it drives me insane, I always feel like crap and super groggy. When I do take them, I always get sort of a dopamine rush and feel super motivated and happy for a bit, and it’s super helpful to get things done. I take my meds even when I’m not working etc bc it just makes life feel nicer and happier. But I have heard many people with adhd say they just feel more chill etc on their meds and I’m paranoid maybe this isn’t “right” or I shouldn’t be getting this “rush”. I just almost feel guilty? Idk. I just am wondering if anyone else has felt this and if it’s normal. I don’t wanna be doing anything “wrong” lol.";r/ADHDers;17;11;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n5di3z/im_worried_i_enjoy_my_adhd_meds_too_much/

2025-08-30 03:01:06;Are my symptoms a reason to pursue a diagnosis?;"Hi everyone. Quick disclaimer, I know that reddit is not a place to get a diagnosis, I just wanted to list my symptoms and see if anyone who does have an ADHD diagnosis thinks it sounds similar to their own symptoms/if it sounds like a reason to go see a professional for a diagnosis. Here are my symptoms:

Since I was a kid, I have always struggled with getting distracted. I would take 3 hours to clean my room because I would get distracted my all my things. I was homeschooled with my older sister and I always took hours longer than her to finish my work because of my attention span. One time, my parents asked me to put my packed suitcase in the car because we were getting ready to leave. I put it in the car, only to realize I forgot to pack ANY clothes. I still get teased to this day.

I do not know why but I am TERRIBLE at time estimation and management. If someone asks me how long it will take me to finish a task, I get incredibly and irrationally frustrated and irritable because I just do not know. I have always struggled with being on time, which may also be due to my OCD (I have been actually diagnosed) which makes me paranoid about double checking and having everything I need before I leave.

I am not hyperactive. I do not interrupt people or have a hard time waiting my turn in a conversation. I also am not very chatty. I do not have a hard time relaxing but I am constantly fidgeting, sometimes in weird ways that I do not realize until someone calls me out.

I have pretty bad meltdowns when my routines are interrupted or plans change, often requiring sensory supports like a weighted blanket or laying on the floor. It will feel like I cannot move my body or get anything done.

I cannot tell you how many times I will be looking someone in the face, nodding and reacting appropriately to what is being said to me, but not hearing a goddamn word that is being said. Its caused me to not know how to get assignments done at work or school and it has caused numerous arguments with my partner. I cannot blame him for getting frustrated either. I really do not mean to. Also, sometimes someone will say something to me and I provide an autopilot response. After they walk away, I often realize within a few minutes that I did not respond appropriately to what was said, like laughing when being told a serious story.

I have a really hard time with retaining book information. I could write a 30-page research paper on the same topic for a month and not be able to recall or explain things about the topic when asked. It affects my school and work.

Any help or input is appreciated! If you have made it this far thank you so much for reading.";r/ADHDers;6;9;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n3g46r/are_my_symptoms_a_reason_to_pursue_a_diagnosis/
2025-08-29 12:52:46;I am done being ADHD..;"Hi, I’m a 24-year-old woman diagnosed with ADHD since I was 12. (I was lucky to be the disruptive type, so I didn’t fly under the radar for too long.) English is not my first language, so please bear with me. If something is unclear, I’ll be happy to explain.

I’ve been on medication since my diagnosis and I’m still taking it. Around 16, I developed anxiety, and since starting university at 19, my depressive symptoms have increased (I’m Canadian). During university, I had a part-time job, was very involved in student associations, and still managed to maintain good grades. Naturally, I burned out a year and a half ago, right as I was finishing my bachelor’s degree, and I’ve been taking antidepressants since then.

From the start, my parents always wanted me to have the same opportunities as everyone else, even if that meant I had to work harder than others to get through. This fall, I’ll be entering the final year of my master’s degree in psychoeducation (a profession unique to my province, somewhere between special needs work and psychology).

At the beginning of this summer, when school ended and I took on a new, challenging job while keeping a part-time role at another, I had a realization that really shook me: I will probably always have ADHD, and I will likely always need medication to function.

(Quick disclaimer before continuing: it may sound like I’m bragging, but I’m not! Yes, I’m proud of myself, but I want to give an accurate picture.)

This summer I realized that even though I’m excelling in my field (I’ve already been offered three jobs after my studies), I will always struggle with organization, time management, deadlines, communication, motivation, and more. (And yes, I’ve tried lists, reminders, and all the strategies—I work in the field, so I know them. Being diagnosed early and learning how to manage my symptoms is one reason I’ve made it this far.)

But for the first time, I feel ashamed and frustrated that I have ADHD. I know I have so many good opportunities, but I’m afraid my ADHD will somehow ruin them. I’m angry that I don’t get to function like “normal” people.

If I could illustrate it, it feels like fighting with a best friend. I know my creativity, spontaneity, and unique way of thinking are strengths—and I love those parts of myself! But I also hate being unreliable, disorganized, perceived as immature, and impulsive. Right now, I can’t stop thinking that all the hard work I’ve put into becoming a professional and building my career will inevitably be impacted by ADHD. I feel defeated.

I don’t know if anyone else relates to this, but I feel like no one really understands the dichotomy. My boyfriend also has ADHD, but his is closer to the giftedness/ADD spectrum. My parents definitely underestimate the severity of my symptoms. Only my colleagues seem to accept the duality in me—being very disorganized but also having great clinical instincts.

I just feel really lost…";r/adhd_anxiety;10;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1n2ydcz/i_am_done_being_adhd/
2025-08-29 12:34:31;I’ve had lifelong depression and anxiety in addition to ADHD;Not really sure what flair to use, it’s not really a rant since I’ve accepted it, but I figured this would be a good place to talk. I know some people say you shouldn’t accept mental illnesses and always believe you can overcome them, but while years of therapy and medication have improved my symptoms to the point where I can mostly function normally, I don’t think I’ll ever be totally “cured”. I don’t even know what caused the depression and anxiety because I haven’t had any trauma, but although I was only diagnosed as a young adult thats been part of my life for as long as I can remember. Idk if it’s related to ADHD somehow or if it’s genetic, but anyway idk if anyone can relate or not but I just wanted to get that off my chest.;r/ADHDers;11;3;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n2y1rq/ive_had_lifelong_depression_and_anxiety_in/
2025-08-29 06:48:23;When I unmask, people think I'm crazy. 😔;"I'm a 45 year old woman. I was diagnosed about 7 years ago, but forgot I was diagnosed. (How's that irony for ya) 
I got ""re-diagnosed"" again within the last year and started treatment a few months ago. I've learned so much about having ADHD and realized that all this time that I thought that I was really good at blending in, I was really just masking. I had too because otherwise I've always heard I'm ""too much"" . I'm over dramatic, or I just need to slow down or calm down. My favorite... ""Take a breath"" 
When I'm just talking normal. Well I'm really tired of pretending I'm ""normal"" but it seems that when I really show my true self, especially with doctors, that I get treated like I'm crazy. I've lost (gladly, actually) friends that I tried so hard to fit in with for so many years because I don't want to ""fit in"" anymore. I want to be unapologetically my self. I'm quirky and messy and forgetful. I talk too much, I lose things constantly and I never stop making some kind of noises or signing and bouncing around. When I am very comfortable,  I probably act a lot like a care free child. But ... Again, I'm not crazy. I'm 45. I have held down very good jobs, all long term positions. I raised an Autistic child with Type 1 diabetes and mental health struggles all alone. She's currently a second year Engineering Student living in her own half way across the country. I moved out of my childhood home at 16 and started working. Etc....Im ok. I'm a productive member of society who as always blended in no matter how different I felt. 
So why now.... Am I being treated like I'm crazy? Does anyone else feel like unmasking is frowned upon or getting you judged by peers or doctors? ";r/ADHDers;23;8;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n2qrnm/when_i_unmask_people_think_im_crazy/
2025-08-29 01:25:11;Wisey Review: Not a cure but works for me;"In this Wisey review, I’ll share my personal experience with the platform. Like many, I’m skeptical of online “tests” - they often feel like fluffy funnels. Since I already work with a psychologist for ADHD, I wasn’t searching for a miracle cure, just a tool to make daily focus a bit easier. After seeing Wisey ads repeatedly, I finally gave it a try.

Wisey Review: First impressions - elephant in the room first: Wisey is mainly a web product, not a native app. That’s a minus if you want deep offline mode or all the polished app-store features. Is it critical? For me, no. On mobile, it runs fine in-browser; add it to your home screen and it’s basically “app-ish.”

Flow-wise, you start with a short quiz that’s actually decent, then Wisey builds a course around you. The daily load is small (15-20 minutes), and most of the content is solid. Some of it is generic, but the memory-training course was a pleasant surprise: practical drills, easy to apply, and engaging enough to revisit. There’s also access to three extra apps; being honest, I didn’t use them much, so can’t judge.

What could make Wisey better? I’d prefer one unified app hub with a built-in timer, tighter reminder controls, and richer progress graphs. The web-first limits mean you’ll miss a bit of that native feel. Still, as a support tool - not therapy, not a diagnosis - Wisey did its job: it helped me stick to a 15–30 min focus block daily.

Overall, Wisey is legit, not a scam. It’s more positive than negative, especially if you’re okay with web-first tools and want a lightweight scaffold for habits and focus. My advice: give it 7 days with specific goals; if you feel momentum by mid-week, keep it. If not, cancel and move on.

2025-08-27 20:32:02;ADHD DIAGNOSIS;"So happy and proud of myself and I wanted to share within this community, so back story I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but didn’t get treated / support during this time. I have a long and I mean a very long history with behavioural problems with being impulsive / attention issues and not being able to have a long term employment, relationships and all I  have wanted was a quiet brain. I realise and wanted better for myself so I decided to get into therapy and have been doing it for a whole year and my psychologist said very honestly I think you should see a psychiatrist for your ADHD and get the support and treatment you deserve and it has been the best thing I have ever done. I was open and honest about myself and self-destructive behaviour and what I wanted from the appointment and I finally felt in my life I was listened to and understood. 

I was diagnosed with Combined ADHD at a Severe level 

I also have anxiety, depression and PTSD due to childhood trauma. 

I was a high school dropout and didn’t graduate but did my cert 3 in community services and now I am a support worker and I finally feel like I can have the life I wanted and deserve and help other people who struggle with their own mental health. 


My treatment plan is Dexamphetamine, 2 of the 5mg two or three times a day when needed and it has changed my life and just wanting other people’s experiences with ADHD and the treatment. 

I feel like getting treatment and being so open and honest about my struggles was the best thing and I feel like Dex has helped with having with.

 * Clear mind and not over thinking 

* Being more self aware and not being impulsive

* Not over talking like I usually do 

* Able to focus on what I need to do without being distracted 

* I am more positive in myself and I want to do and with getting stuff accomplished.

2025-08-27 13:29:03;does having anxiety and depression make ADHD meds not work well?;"I’m not trying to ask anyone to give me a definite yes or no to my situation (and not a diagnosis either cause I’ve been diagnosed) of course but,

I’m 20 and I have definitely been struggling with adhd for a long time ever since I was young

My mum passed away on December the 31st and she was basically there for me my whole life as I lived with just her, so I’ve been struggling with a lot of depression and anxiety this whole year due to having to live with my dad in the middle of nowhere (I don’t have a job since I have been my mums carer since I was 17)

Anyway, I got put on vyvanse 40mg around February and it made a difference in my binge eating and stress eating but I didn’t feel very focused and I still can’t do basic tasks. My psychiatrist told me he was gonna put me on anxiety meds and depression medicine but I ended up asking him if I could try a higher dose because I was worried he was trying to say I don’t have adhd when I struggled to be able to get a diagnosis which I know I have.

I’m on 50mg now and it was okay at first but then I’ve started to become more depressed due to personal things happening in my life and a lot more anxious. On top of already feeling anxious about my psychiatrist incase he doesn’t believe that I’m struggling with adhd symptoms since he didn’t diagnose me it was someone else.

So I was wondering if people had similar struggles to me and if anxiety and depression can make focus and attention bad like adhd, and if being on adhd medicine and depression medicine will actually help? I’m unsure if this is the right place to post this but I didn’t know what else to do because I’m struggling alot with being able to clean and do my business course etc,  I’m just stuck sitting in bed and working with my dad 3 times a week. I want to get my life together cause I’m obviously 20 and too grown to be doing all this.

2025-08-27 05:29:48;I just need to vent abt my meds;about 6 months ago i started taking adhd meds for the first time, with the lowest dose of methylphenidate (concerta), a month or two after my brother started taking methylphenidate (im pretty sure it was ritalin). for the first few days it was SUPER helpful, it felt like i could do anything and i thought that that was all it would take to get my shit together and be able to be consistently productive, but then it kinda stopped being as helpful. it was better than nothing but it honestly didnt make a huge difference. my dr increased the dose and it was the same thing, being great for the first few days and then it wasnt as effective anymore. at the beginning of this month my dr raised the dose again and at first it was the same as usual, with the first few days being good, but this time, instead of just being less useful but still better than the previous dose now its worse than it was before i ever started taking meds. its like all the energy its supposed to give has just been replaced with unbearable tiredness. so now what happens is i spend the entire day feeling completely exhausted and when i go to bed sleeping is even harder than usual. for as long as i can remember i've had a hard time sleeping, it always takes over an hour to fall asleep and sometimes i wake up randomly between 2-6am, and to help with that my doctor put me on hydroxyzine, i've been on it for months now and its been pretty helpful. now that the concerta is having these dumb side effects it feels like im sleeping worse than i was when i was completely unmedicated. its like the concerta took over and made me totally unable to get any sleep even though i spend the whole day too tired to do anything. at first i figured that i got a tolerance for the hydroxyzine and getting a higher dose of that might fix it but then i randomly got the idea that maybe it was the concerta and started looking into that and that was how i realized it was from the concerta. so yeah i just needed to complain abt this, i dont need someone to explain why this happened because i figured that part out. im just so annoyed bc this was supposed to be an improvement but now everything is harder than ever. i have a virtual appointment with my dr on friday so im gonna tell her abt all this ofc and see abt trying something else bc the for concerta the dosage goes from 27mg (my previous dose)(wasn't enough but better than nothing) to the next step up being 36mg (the new dose im on now)(living hell) and since i dont think its possible to try anything in between it would probably be most effective to just try a different drug completely. my brother also isnt taking methylphenidate anymore bc it didnt work for him either (hes been on adderall which didnt help but he just picked up a new prescription today, idk what it is tho). it is kinda nice having a sibling who also has adhd bc i can yap to him abt it and he actually gets it, but also bc since he got diagnosed sooner than i did so he might find smth that works sooner than i do, and since we're siblings i assume that if something works for him it would probably also work for me. idk how to end this i just kinda needed to vent bc this whole thing is rlly pissing me off. it's only been like a week and a half that ive been feeling like this but im so fucking sick of being too tired to function and knowing that trying to sleep will do absolutely nothing to fix it;r/ADHDers;0;1;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n0yido/i_just_need_to_vent_abt_my_meds/

2025-08-25 17:57:12;ADHD relationship anxiety;"Hi everyone! I’m 26F and  got diagnosed with adhd earlier this year. I’m on adhd medication and some antydepresant that should help with my anxiety. During past months I also started to notice some autistic traits in me.

I’m in a relationship with an autistic person. She is the greatest relationship I’ve ever had. I love her very much but I really struggle with our differences sometimes. I always try to support her in her struggles, give her what she needs and respect her boundaries. She is currently away on vacation with her close friends. We agreed that we will call each other every day same hour but it’s not happening. In one voice message she said that she would really want to hear me but she promised a friend that they would watch a movie and that she will also not call the next day. I did not expect from her to call me and talk for hours. 10 minutes would be nice. I went to sleep crying that day, thinking that a movie cannot wait 5 minutes. She is not good at communicating when we don’t see each other. She says she doesn’t like using phone. On the other hand she still uses it for checking instagram. I really try to understand that but sometimes I feel really hurt.

My father died in June and I felt really bad the past few weeks. She tried to support me with that but I noticed that she sometimes cuts me off when I try to talk about this topic. I already talked with her a couple of times about the fact that she is not checking in on me or not texting me for the whole day. She says she struggle with autism and it’s really difficult for her to keep in touch via phone. I really understand that but sometimes it would be nice to get  a message from her once a day, asking how I feel or telling me that she loves me. I don’t want to ruin her vacation, we already had a talk during this time about her not making an effort. This whole situation gives me such strong anxiety.

I want to be the best partner for her and understand her but when I’m telling her about my needs I don’t feel understood. I get in my head all the time, spiralling about potential breakup and that maybe she does not care about me so much. Rejection sensitivity is really strong, I’m gonna bring this up on my therapy session this week but I would really appreciate any advice from you guys 🖤";r/adhd_anxiety;9;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mzm9tr/adhd_relationship_anxiety/

2. Saturday, morning (well afternoon) I don't wake up until 12:30. Decide I should get to the task ASAP. Don't even begin until 3pm. Get a few things done then dick around the house doing random shit that doesn't need to be done. Anything but task A. Focused work only happened from  8-11pm and then give myself and undeserving binge watching reward. Pass out in the couch around 2am.
3. Sunday, wake up and ready by 9 to hit the ground running. At 10, decided I wanna make a new dish for lunch when theres still so much left to be done on task A. I've never made it before but that did not tell me I should not do it now and make it later. Spent the next several hours making the dish from scratch and beating around the bush in between but not working on task A. Cursed myself at least 5 times in the process. But then I'm like I've already fkd the day, might as well see the dish through. 6pm, reality sets in. Work on whatever from 6-10 and then I give up. 

Self loathing for the past hour. Tomorrow is Monday and I have to be at work early so my day today is done. Yet another week of fckery.

This has been me my whole life. School assignments, exams. I've spent so many weekends of my life playing catch up cos I didn't do shit when I was supposed to.

I am so annoyed at myself, I don't even know what to do. I could cry but I can't even get myself to do that to let it all out. I wanna just scream at the top of my lungs. I'm 35. How TF does a middle aged man not know how to be responsible for his life and career?

Oh and the fun part is, I will follow through on tasks for literally everyone else. You want me to pick you up from the airport at 1am, while I have a meeting at 7am tomorrow? No problem. I'll be there.

2025-08-25 05:01:10;Is my brother's girlfriend ADHD or simply entitled?;"Hi, my brother who has ADD and his girlfriend who has ADHD are both 25 years old and have been recently engaged. For him, school has always been a harsh struggle. It strangles him down and makes his life harder. He can't concentrate when doing anything related to school, yet when it comes to his work which he is passionate about he can sit for hours and ""lock in"". I feel that after he was officialy diagnosed he changed. He used to scold me because I didn't brush my teeth three times a day or tie my shoes properly but now that he's dating his girlfriend he eats a lot, lives in a messy room and fianancial situation. His lover, who also has ADHD, claims that it is extremely difficult to do house chores and start her day. She expects everything to be served for her and my brother promotes this attitude by threating her as a little princess being saved by him, a night in shining armor. You say it's hard for you brush your teeth but you'll be ready in no time when it comes to shopping and going to the pool. She can say hurtful things at times and bullies my brother, but the thing that bothers me the most is that she acts like a literal child. She always wants things resolved for her and always makes my brother buy useless crap because she won't take a no for an answer.She is very childish and it is hard to see. My brother also suffers from this childish behavior but it runs in my family. I feel like his gf has influenced him a lot .As stated before, he lives in a very messy apartement because of her. He said that he hates that but is now indifferent. He does all the chores while she rots in the couch watching reels. I am not very informed about this topic but I truly believe that my brothers suffers from something. Maybe it's not ADD but childhood trauma because his teachers treated him unfairly and said he was good for nothing so he vicitimizes himself and thinks he is unworthy. I don't hate his girlfriend but she is pathetic at times and complains like a child.

So what are your thoughts? I'm just asking this out of geniune curiosty. Thanks.";r/ADHDers;0;9;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1mz7dma/is_my_brothers_girlfriend_adhd_or_simply_entitled/
2025-08-23 21:36:05;Fulfilling career for ADHD. Please help!;"tl;dr: I’ve always had top grades and broad interests, but no clear passion. Tried law, found it too monotonous. Now considering business or a gap year, but still feel lost. Question: If you have ADHD and a job you love, what is it?

I need objective advice about my career path. I’m in the process of getting a diagnosis, not on medication yet, and feel very lost.

Since childhood I’ve pushed myself to excel in every subject, which left me without a clear passion. I like math, science, and humanities equally, so I can’t see myself fitting into just one direction. Over the years I’ve considered medicine, pharmacy, law, business, economics, education—you name it. I get interested, then lose motivation.

This year I studied law but found the work too monotonous and couldn’t imagine doing it long term. Now I’m thinking about switching to business/economics, but I’m not sure it would fulfill me. A gap year could give me more options (because this year I missed the first deadline for enrollment), but I worry I’d still feel undecided.

With my grades I could get into any program, and it feels like a waste to end up in something that doesn’t inspire me. But business imo is a degree that has a million different career paths - thats why maybe I could find something I enjoy.

2025-08-22 21:25:02;Anxiety made my body overly reactive and now I can’t take my meds anymore;"I’m 20F and have been struggling with anxiety and perfectionism since I was 14. When I was 17 I got diagnosed with ADHD and started taking Ritalin. Starting meds has helped me a lot, but sadly my anxiety never really went away. Over the past year, my anxiety has been the worst it has ever been( probably because I overloaded and pushed myself way too hard) , and in June my body basically hit a breaking point. I started spiraling over small things, feeling tense, with a racing heartbeat and fast breathing whenever I tried to do anything productive. I also started having trouble falling and staying asleep, and I couldn’t take Ritalin anymore because it made the insomnia and anxiety worse (even though it never caused any of those issues before).

I’ve since then started taking complete rest from everything, and I’ve also started using cbt techniques for my anxiety along with sleep therapy. I’m already doing better, but still struggling…I’ve also tried restarting Ritalin twice. The first time I tried restarting Ritalin I couldn’t sleep at all. Two weeks later, I tried again and managed to sleep 3-4 hours, but that’s it.

Today my psychiatrist said it would be fine to try taking Ritalin again, but I’m not so sure. My sleep isn’t back to normal yet, and I’m honestly scared that my body still won’t be able to handle it. I really want to get back on my meds because managing my ADHD without them has been incredibly hard and Ritalin has made a huge difference in my quality of life. Now I’m scared I’ll never be able to take them again and that my body will stay in this reactive state forever. Has anyone else (with both Adhd and anxiety) gone through something similar?

2025-08-21 03:13:38;Wanted to get diagnosed with ADHD, left with a Bipolar Diagnosis.;"Y’all, I don’t know what to think. This diagnosis has me questioning everything! I’ve been studying for the LSAT (pray for me), and my distractedness has been out of control. I’ve always done well in school, graduated with honors in Pre-Law, but I wanted to get a handle on my ADHD before law school. I’m bubbly, social, and a “Most Spirited” award winner in high school, lol. Everyone around me has always said I have ADHD—I misplace things, forget mid-sentence, and I’m high energy. So I finally decided to start the process.

I booked with a psychiatric NP I found on Zocdoc, and while the quick availability should’ve been a red flag, I went for it. At the appointment (less than 18 hours later), the unprofessionalism was obvious. When I said I wanted an ADHD evaluation, she immediately told me she couldn’t diagnose ADHD. I’d already paid $200, so I stayed. She asked why I thought I had ADHD, and then veered into abandonment issues, my father cheating on my mom, and made me tear up. Then she asked about my spirituality; I shared that I’m a devout Christian, talked about my best friend’s cancer and a recent loss, but also how I still find joy through faith. She just responded with, “Mmm.”

We discussed anxiety, control, and how I feel validated by good grades. After just 30 minutes, she diagnosed me with ADHD, anxiety, and **bipolar disorder**. Bipolar?! I’ve never once thought that. She said, “Being this happy all the time isn’t normal,” and claimed my joy after good grades was “manic” and that she could see my mood swings in the short session. I explained that I simply love school and feel proud when I achieve—but she still insisted it was mania.

For background: I’ve never been on medication. Yet she wanted me to start **Latuda** (an antipsychotic) for two weeks “to rule out bipolar.” My stomach dropped. Medication already makes me anxious, and I felt blindsided. She brushed it off like it was no big deal, but I left knowing I’d never go back.

I went home, researched Latuda, and was floored. This whole experience left me confused, overwhelmed, and honestly stunned at how quickly such a heavy diagnosis and medication were handed down in a 30-minute session.

2025-08-17 08:13:59;Situation on vacation with backseat driving;"Backseat driving has always set me off. Now that I've been diagnosed, I've found out that it's a common reaction for those with ADHD. 

I recently took a vacation to an incredibly large state that put me, my son and my partner in a large rental vehicle with 4 other people, two of them kids, two other female adult inlaws. It was perhaps the largest passenger I have ever driven with incredibly sensitive brakes. 

From the start, the in laws started back seat driving. This made me very upset and they continued doing it despite me making clear that it was agitating me. I tried to put on music as it calms me but one of the in laws called my music junk and I was made to turn it off. My partner even said ""it doesn't work."" 

As I was agitated it affected my driving. Braking was harder and I wasn't slowing down. Despite being the only registered driver on the rental, I was banned from driving.

At the end I had to be the one to drive to the airport as I was still the only registered driver on the rental. Before I even got out of the driveway one of the inlaws started backseat driving again and didn't stop. This got me incredibly agitated and my driving became reckless, which was on me. I wanted my phone so I could quietly put music on, but my partner said I ""didn't need it."" 

After I got home, I told my partner that in the future I would need separate vehicles for long trips; possibly separate accommodations. While I admit I need to learn to control my emotions my inlaws urge to backseat drive is something out of my control. I was also told if my medication worked it wouldn't have set me off. If I can have a quiet vehicle with my music playing it takes a lot less effort to stay calm.

Is expecting my inlaws to forgo backseat driving unreasonable? Is expecting to drive a separate vehicle ""childish"", as my partner puts it? Is it unreasonable for me to expect to use music as a calming mechanism?";r/adhd_anxiety;7;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mscf41/situation_on_vacation_with_backseat_driving/
2025-08-16 04:25:05;30M Huge anxiety these week after starting 2 weeks ago Concerta;"Hi, ive been diagnosed 2 weeks ago at 30 yo. I am very skeptical about if I am ADHD or not, I ve been feeling a bit like an impostor these days sometimes.

The thing is that Ive started with Concerta 18, everything was good but I felt the effect to be a bit low specially after lunch, so my doctor went up to 36. First day a bit anxious at the beginning of the day but after that everything seemed good. I would say my focus and even nervous tics I had they improved.

The thing is that I started my treatment on holidays, so very relaxed and all. These week I started working again (pretty stressful job) and I had a huge fight with my girlfriend. 3 days ago I was SUPER anxious all day. Yesterday it was better again, focused and not really super nervous (just the bit of energy that stimulants should give). But today, again, I was super anxious, feeling uneasy, thinking a lot on my girl, building imaginary scenarios (and not good ones, ofc), worrying about work.

I ve been having a hard time, but I dont know if

* Im not an adhd and after the initial motivation spike the stimulants are starting to fuck all my ""normal"" brain.
* Im an adhd but the Concerta makes me feel more focused also in the bad things and not being able to detach from this kind of problems
* I need to wait until my body gets used to the dose and meds.

Hello everyone,

So I’m 26 and was always a high achiever and quiet child growing up so I never thought I’d have ADHD. (I have always had anxiety though)

However since reaching my mid 20s I’ve noticed that I have so many problems with executive function, time management, literally so so many posts on this sub I relate to and my mind is ALWAYS hyperactive. 

I am planning to take the LSAT soon but in preparing I’ve grown even more suspect that I have ADHD. So I’ve decided to find out once and for all and on Monday and Tuesday I have a two-part test with a local psychologist. I just spoke to him on the phone and I’m super nervous about it all. It’s also a significant financial investment but I want to know my diagnosis, if I have one, for sure before I start my law school journey. I think it will put my mind at ease to at least have the knowledge. 

But I’m so so stressed about it all!

Does anyone have any insight into what the test might include or have any advice for me to calm my nerves? I’d sincerely appreciate it 💕";r/adhd_anxiety;1;8;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mr4wbd/being_tested_for_the_first_time_what_to_expect/

2025-08-15 15:39:50;Please help me convince my Doc & therapist;"
I (26f) have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder since the age of 18. After my second manic episode last year, I returned to Law School (in India).
I discovered that a formerly gifted me was unable to focus and got too distracted randomly. This made me realise that to an extent I was always like this. Only, school and high school were easier than Law School.
This sent me down a rabbit hole where I used every resource possible to understand ADHD.

I could connect various incidents and behaviours to ADHD, especially Type C.
I spent some time and wrote a 10,000 word document detailing the 
stims (physical,sensory, verbal, tactile),sensory difficulties, injuries (absent mindedness)BFRBs,affected facets (hyperactivity, impulsivity, executive function etc),areas of life, hyperfixations,ADHD vs Bipolar (clarity about the overlap)masking mechanisms and so-called advantages that I've shown.

Both my parents (who show separate signs of ADHD themselves) have declined to accept my conclusion. They just call me 'lazy' 'unfocused' and 'spoilt'

My Doc refuses to accept this because according to her, I can't have adhd and read two novels at the same time (I get distracted and bored which is why I switch, also novels & movies are my hyperfixations imo)
She also says that people who were exceptional in school can't have ADHD.

I would like to clarify here that I am not seeking adhd meds, I know a friend who functions just fine without them, I already have a lot of bipolar meds.I am seeking some support via therapy and I would like to reorganize my Law studies somehow.

My last chance to convince anyone is to convince my therapist on Monday the 18th.

2025-08-15 06:54:21;Migraine and ADHD;"Hey everyone, I'm 29 year-old afab non-binary person and I was diagnosed with ADHD around half a year ago. Due to high blood pressure I was not able to start ADHD medication right away but now I was finally able to. So it's coming up to day 4 on a low starting dosage of Elvanse (20mg), I have my next appointment to up the dosage next week, so we are starting slowly. 

What concerns me the most currently is migraines: I have chronic migraine and I've been doing okay with them for few months, going from around 17 migraine days per month to around 6 migraine days per month for the past two months.
I read that migraine and ADHD are common together and that one of the starting side effects from ADHD medication can be headaches/migraines, especially around when the effect of the meds is starting to wear off. I know it's only been 3 days but bc my migraine has been chronic for over 5 years and I've lived with migraine in general for almost 15 years, I am easily a bit paranoid with it. So I was wondering if any of you had headaches/migraines while starting your ADHD meds and how long did it take to get over that side effect? And what helped you with that? 

I do admit that it is in general not the best possible time for my migraine anyway since my eating is shit, it has been a heatwave, I forget to drink, my sleepin schedule is whack, my Botox was late... I know I need to keep my eye out on these as well but I guess I kinda need encouragement to not just give up with Elvanse before I've really even started fully. 

EDIT: My brain is clearly not really working currently bc I'm having a migraine.. But I meant that I am currently having a migraine and that I'm afraid that my meds could be causing it.

2025-08-13 22:43:40;How are ADHDers feeling about themselves regarding their diagnosis?;"

Well, I have now joined the long line of people being banned from the main sub, for ""misinformation"" and ""toxic positivity"", but in reality; for presenting my view of myself. I'm a biologist and have read tons of studies and research on different diagnoses, cognitive therapy etc. It's one of my many interests. Granted, I don't remember much details, but it has lead me to a perspective of myself that I find helpful and helps me cope and stay happy despite being ADHD: 

That I'm not more ""wrong"" than the average person and that if many circumstances in my life were different, I could both end up struggling more or not struggle at all with how I'm built. Family members of mine could definitely get a diagnosis if they were struggling with how life ended up. But no, they function fine as many factors compensate or aleviate the negative concequences.

I fit into the man-made ADHD category of today and in today's society, but even my neuropsychologist thinks medical perspectives of ""the neurodivergent umbrella"" with go through lots of changes in the future. The more we learn, the more we see the differences and similarities within, and the extreme amount of individual variance. You need only look at the recent changes in perspective regarding hyperactivity and gender.

Most people have bad genes in *some* regard or something they are particularily good/bad at. Colour blindness, lactose intolerance (which is not considered an illness in many parts of the world), aphantasia, weak stomach, good/bad with faces, photographic memory, sensitivity to blood sugar levels, neurotisism, unusual circadian rythm... etc etc..

I've been on vyvanse for years, sometimes paying hundreds of dollars a month when insurance was being annoying, just because its worked SO incredibly well for me. This has not been my experience with the generic now for awhile and I'm not sure what to do. I don't particularly want to go back to paying a ton of money or trying to convince my doctor that something isn't right here. 

I used to take it and it'd kick in anywhere between 45-65 minutes. Sometimes it will take a solid three hours to kick in now, frequently taking 2+ or up to 4. This throws off my timing, obviously, as I don't want to take it too late and have it keep me up or I’ll wake up, take it, and need it to start accomplishing life within a reasonable time frame. Sometimes I don't really feel any effects at all, other times, it hits me so hard and I feel like I'm tweaking and get anxious. Generally, though, it’s been giving me a lot of anxiety, increased heart rate, and I don’t feel great. But when I don’t take it, I don’t feel like I can function, have no motivation, simple things feel like a mountain, and then I get stuck in the procrastination spiral and feel mentally terrible and down. 

I used to just take my vyvanse, it'd kick in in its normal time frame, sometimes I get a little jittery for 30 minutes, but overall it'd make me feel calm and I could function like a normal human. I slept better when I took it consistently. Every aspect of my life felt more stable. It worked better at regulating my mood than any antidepressant or anti-anxiety med I've ever tried. It just made me feel normal. Emptying the dishwasher no longer seemed like an unmanageable massive task. Now, if I even feel it do anything, I never know when it will kick in, if it’s going to ruin my day with anxiety and jitteriness, if it will make me moody, etc. Its not helping my mood at all. Honestly, it might be making it worse in ways. I don't feel stable and “normal”. I have a baby now and I crave the stability name brand vyvanse gave me, but more often than not, it kicks in and makes me more overwhelmed. Some days it feels like it’s working properly and I feel good, but it’s so rare. I feel so level when that happens. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't want to believe the generic could be that different, but this absolutely sucks. I've checked my past bottles and the pharmacy definitely shuffles through the different generic manufacturers and I haven't noticed one being better than the other. They've all sucked compared to my sweet, sweet name brand. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please share your insight and experiences! 

Editing to add- I’ve tried concerta and adderall in the past, neither worked well for me. Vyvanse was light a magic switch to normal functioning. I got diagnosed around 20 when I was in college, living on my own, and the skills I used to get through my teen years were no longer enough to keep up and manage things. So much made sense about my life and struggles after diagnosis via a full day neuropsych work up.

2025-08-13 05:59:15;Just got diagnosed. What are your positive and negative experience with meds?;"Hi guys,

I'm 28 (F) and just got diagnosed with ADHD. I'm curious if anyone with more experience could tell me their negative and positive experiences with medication? I have known people who act and speak so differently on ADHD meds and I really like the way my brain thinks and don't want to change all the complexity and depth. I also tend to gravitate towards more natural solutions and away from medication in my life. BUT on the other hand it would be sooo nice to not fail all the time. I'm currently in Grad school for a Masters in Ed and I am getting married in a yearish. I would really love to be able to be better at taking care of myself and not fail over and over again. I'm not looking for medical advice ofc just peoples experiences so I can be fully informed before I decide if I want to be medicated or not. Also I'm not trying to come across judgey to anyone who makes either choice that's your decision and I respect it. Any information is welcome:)";r/ADHDers;7;8;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1momdk0/just_got_diagnosed_what_are_your_positive_and/
2025-08-12 11:17:21;Dealing with my Anxiety and ADHD;"Hi everyone - have never posted on here but was looking for a little life advice. I'm a 35M and have had a hell of a year to 18 months.

I lost my father unexpectedly - who I was very close with, our first pregnancy was lost at 16 weeks, death of my father in law to cancer and a massive unexpected surgery for my only sibling. During this time l've been suffering from severe health anxiety as death has been all around me - getting chest pains, brain zaps (like shocks in my head), and panic attacks to the point where it was every other day.

I also have a pretty stressful job that at times does not help my situation but I am good at what I do and in general is in a field I usually love doing. My two trips overseas this year for work both gave me panic attacks. I think this year and my job combined has in general given me a short fuse which I have been working on and haven’t loved about myself as I’m geneallly not confrontational. After doing all of the things that I thought would help (gym, therapy, etc.) - I eventually went to a psych to talk through.

I'm also a very social person who works from home and feel like the more I have going on, the less I mentally have to deal with upstairs. With that being said, I really struggle to just relax - when I'm on vacation or have a second to myself - and when I need something to fixate on when l'm not working or being social, I think that's when my symptoms become the worst.

Long story short - in the past couple of weeks I was prescribed Wellbutrin by the psychologist. I initially was on board to take the Wellbutrin but delayed by a few days and have since been hesitant. Part of the reason is in the meantime, I have cut out all caffeine for two weeks and my anxiety seems to be under control. I used to have a cold brew a day but cutting it out has made me recently feel much better.

My question is - have any of you been in a similar position, not knowing the next step to take?

I was initially given Wellbutrin for both diagnosed anxiety and adhd (and a little ocd). And even if the anxiety seems to be gone, is it just proactive for me to give it a try?

I just have never been on psych meds (or meds for that matter) and want to find the long term solution but am seriously 50/50 on what I should do.

My dad was the best, but he also suffered at times from many of my same symptoms - and I just want to do all that I can knowing that. Despite my tragedies over the past few months - I believe I have a great life and am generally not depressed (but frustrated from my past symptoms). I am just wondering if there's another quality of life that I can unlock.

I want to be the best version of myself after losing my father and hopefully becoming one soon. Any advice/ guidance helps. Thanks in advance.";r/adhd_anxiety;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mnxrsk/dealing_with_my_anxiety_and_adhd/
2025-08-12 08:31:27;Any ADHDers who have had chronic anxiety since childhood?;"
I have had panic attacks since I was a child and was diagnosed with severe ADHD at 18. Did some deep research and found that many kids have the same problem. They come in with chronic anxiety often for no trauma related reasons, but come to find out they have ADHD. 

 - For some reason the lack of dopamine I had caused some type of hypersensitivity to change in my surroundings and within my body. If I ate something and it made me feel the slightest off I would focus very hard on it unintentionally till I got anxious and eventually panic. I remember once I was rearranging my room and got a panic attack bc it was changed it was different than before and I didn’t know if it was good or bad. 

- This made making friends very difficult bc they always wanted me to spend the night at their house but I nvr wanted to due to sleeping in another bed and waking up in a different house, or eating something I wasn’t used to. 

- So as you can probably assume that has led me to not liking people that much, they are huge variables and I never can trust them personally. Everyone has a probability and if it is not in the percentage I want I can’t take that risk of freaking out and being humiliated.  

 - At 20yrs I was put on Stratterra. It helps a lot but numbs the mind a lot too. If yall have any relatable stories or tips and tricks shoot them my way, I am 21 and turning a new page. Trying to find a new job and looking for tools to battle my mind to keep me from getting panic attacks. Don’t give me book recommendations please.

2025-08-12 06:54:25;I need medication but my mom hates drugs and refuses to let me go on it.;"So I’m 17 and have autism and ADHD. I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADD (I think that’s what it was called back then, not sure if that’s still the correct/widely used term anymore), when I was like 8 or 9. Ive had severe trouble focusing in school since i was in 1st grade. I started on Ritalin in 5th-6th grade (I think?) and it made me tired and drowsy so I eventually stopped taking it. 

Fast forward to 8th grade, I was 14 and struggled with severe depression and self harm, and spent 2 weeks in the psych ward or whatever you call it. While in the hospital I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I was put on zoloft and adderall. TMI: the zoloft gave me horrible diarrhea, and the adderall also made me drowsy so I was weaned off of both. My mom was extremely hesitant to put me on any sort of medication, and was very adamant that I stopped taking it. 

I’m going to make this as quick and to the point as I possibly can, but my ADHD is making my life miserable. My brain just will not stop. I talk so fast and so much that it makes my head and throat hurt. I have extreme mood swings, my mood will  change in as often as every 15 seconds, and then sometimes I have episodes that last weeks/months. I cant even keep track, it’s so completely random. I forget absolutely everything. The only way I could possibly remember something would be to tape a sticky note on my forehead, and even then it would just be something that’s always there so I’d still forget. My mind is always racing. I cant sleep, I cant focus on anything, I cant make friends. I do have a good group of friends now, but I’ve lost so many friends that I cant trust who’s going to stay or if they’re going to leave me because I’m so annoying. I talk so much and so fast that I get headaches and my throat hurts. I lose my train of thought every 5 seconds and can’t remember for the life of me what I was just saying. I talk so much that my words start to make no sense. People notice. They get off putting vibes and I can tell. I want to yank my brain out of my skull and throw it into the washing machine on maximum speed so then maybe I can be normal. I’d do anything to just be normal. 

I go to an off-site special Ed program for school with about 8 other kids. Even they hate me. I’m the scapegoat of the class and literally no one likes me, even in the place I’m supposed to fit in. The others are quiet, social outcasts, but they’re all similar and they like each other, but not me. I love to socialize. I love to go to parties and shows. I’ve began over scheduling because I need constant stimulation to counteract my constant, never ending energy, otherwise I’d go crazy. I have been doing good with scheduling things, I started utilizing calendars, both a physical and digital one, and I’ve made it a routine to check my calendar for the week every day, and plan accordingly. So I will give myself credit for that. 

Anyway, I feel like i need medication. I’m not saying it’ll be the absolute end all be all, and I’m not 100% certain it’ll solve all my problems, but I want to try it again now that I’m in a good mental state, but my mom refuses. I’ve been asking her about it since last year, but it just turns into a huge argument so I don’t even touch the topic with a 10 foot pole anymore. I feel like if I got on medication, maybe people would tolerate me, and maybe my brain would quiet down for 5 fucking seconds so I could actually focus on shit. I know it should have to be this way, but it is and theres nothing I can do. That’s just how society and the school system works and I just have to fucking deal with it. Maybe I could actually pick up a consistent hobby or interest or talent. Maybe if actually be able to commit to one thing and practice and get good at it instead of my brain running in circles 24/7 and not being able to do one thing for more than 5 minutes. The only thing I have right now is nicotine. I’m addicted to it because it quiets my brain for a very short amount of time, but it wears off quickly so I have to hit my vape over and over and over again until I get dizzy and nauseous. I’ve gone through 3 vapes in the past 2 months. It’s bad. I know it’s bad. I’ve already been caught with a vape once and if I get caught again I’ll be dead. But there’s literally nothing else that makes me feel calm. I’ve tried the stupid breathing exercises. I’ve tried the stupid self care and the stupid essential oils and the stupid mindfulness shit. Fuck all that. I’m beyond help. 

After I turn 18, would it still be reasonable to consult about starting medication? Even if I’d be very close to graduating? I just want to be normal and tolerable and not have to deal with my brain anymore. I turn 18 in 3 months, but there’s already so much shit I plan to do, such as starting T, (I’m trans FTM), getting my name legally changed, getting a better job, all that kind of stuff. Is medication even worth it?

2025-08-11 13:12:18;Dexamfetamine, Duloxetine, and The Terrible, Horrible, No good, Very Bad Month;"G’day all,

So, I have had a hell of a time navigating the mental health system here in Australia in relation to my ADHD.  I finally managed to get in to see a psychiatrist (at a cost of $780 AUD) and managed to get myself sorted to restart my ADHD treatment.  When I say “restart,” I mean I was originally diagnosed in the United States.  I immigrated to Australia a few years ago.  Anyway, I was also on amitryptaline at the time for nerve pain/anxiety.  When I started taking dexamfetamine (the closest thing to adderall here in Australia) I started having brutal chest pains followed by shortness of breath while feeling dizzy.  It turns out that dexamfetamine and amitryptaline (a tricyclic antidepressant) is a deadly combo to take.  So I stopped taking the amitryptaline and waited a few weeks to see what would happen.  The chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness all subsided.  The downside is that I didn’t taper off the amitryptaline, so I got hit hard by withdrawal symptoms.  My mood crashed, my anxiety went through the roof, and my nerve pain returned with a vengeance.  For three weeks, my mental state was pure chaos.  While taking the dexamfetamine, I could focus on my tasks for the most part, but intrusive thoughts managed to win out constantly, which caused my work to suffer majorly.  I’m a motor mechanic by the way, so I have to be on top of everything because people’s lives are on the line if my head isn’t fully in the game.  It all came to a head about three days ago in what I call “the perfect shitstorm.”  

So last week, I had to contend with several things that all piled up and compounded everything going on with my mental state in massive ways.  Not gonna get into a lot of detail, but it involved some extremely bad events emotionally and psychologically to the point that the PTSD flashbacks decided to say hello again…after I’d managed to keep them under control for nearly 16 years.  This was slowing me down at work substantially, so much so that I had three people getting on me about when a vehicle would be done.  I couldn’t focus for the life of me, and the ADHD meds weren’t enough to keep my head where it needed to be at that moment.  I was struggling badly, locked in my own head and didn’t know how to break out and communicate what was going on effectively with my boss, and I did something I’ve never done before in my 20+ years of turning a spanner:  I sent a vehicle out without having everything tightened down properly.  I saw the customer getting into his vehicle to leave and it dawned on me that I didn’t torque check anything like I normally would.  I ran up and stopped him from leaving, apologised and told him I’d need five minutes to double check a few things.  I got everything squared away, and then I got my ass reamed by my boss over it.  There’s a high probability I’ll lose my job over this (because it is a severe safety violation, which I’ll own.  It is my fault at the end of the day), even though I caught it and corrected it.  I finally did figure out a way to fully communicate what was going on and why my head wasn’t in the game.

I went to my doc today and explained the entire situation to him.  So, he prescribed me Duloxetine.  He took the time to find something that would basically kill three birds with one stone:  Nerve pain, anxiety, and depression.  He also wanted to make sure he was giving me something that had the least amount of risk considering the dexamfetamine.

So here’s what I need to know:  Is Duloxetine and dexamfetamine a generally safe combination?  I know that the risk of serotonin syndrome and heart complications still exist with this combo, but I have to do something to get my head back under control.  I apologise for the long read on this, but I felt like the full context of my situation was needed for a better understanding of where I’m at and where I need to be.  The last month just snowballed out of control on me, so any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.  

tl;dr Got back on ADHD meds, TCA I was prescribed at the time nearly blew my heart up, stopped taking TCA, went through withdrawal, other horrible shit went down and broke me mentally/emotionally at the same time, quality of work and life suffered substantially, SNRI/Dexamfetamine combo started today to try and correct my course.

2025-08-11 02:49:26;Oh medication...what to do?!;Short summary, diagnosed with adhd recently in my mid 40's. I've struggled with anxiety/panic disorder since I was in my late teens. I feel like I've been on all of the ssri's over the years plus buspar, Wellbutrin and then of course the only medication I feel actually makes me feel like a normal human, Xanax/alprazolam. I currently just take Cymbalta for the anxiety. For the ADHD my psych started me on Vyvanse which did seem to help me focus but I was feeling kind of anxious. So we are now trying Adderall. I've been on 20mg for almost a week. I think I feel better on it anxiety wise but definitely feel when it kicks it and feel a little amped up. I'm not quick sure if the help with focus is there yet. I think work this week will be the tell. My question is if Vyvanse or Adderall isn't the right fit, what might be a good next step?

2025-08-09 17:21:13;Tolerance break;"10mg IR Ritalin 3-4 times daily
(Mostly 3, 4 if I am still busy)

I’ve been taking it nearly everyday for about 3(?) months now after finally recognising I am the best mentally when I’m regularly medicated. I just feel in control, on track in my studies quieter brain, helps stop intrusive OCD thoughts ect-

I’ve been fighting my usual OCD overthinking that’s telling me I am secretly “an addict” because I have the urge to take it most days, it’s almost like… My ADHD being managed is a desirable feeling… Actually being on schedule for my assignments, being able to sit and not get distracted every 5 seconds and not dealing with intrusive loud thoughts all day feels pretty great, who’d have thunk. 

I have a university holiday coming up, I am going to go visit my parents for about a week and a half. You can see where this is going- I’m planning to take a tolerance break for that time,

1. Give my body a rest


2. Save medication, each appointment is $300 sometimes I come close to running out

3. I’ll be doing a lot of activity, I am a bit sensitive to stimulants- it’s no issue when I’m just doing basic tasks, anything even moderately intense makes my heart rate insane

I am worried I’m going to struggle mentally for that time dealing with my 50 tabs open brain, half of them being OCD intrusive thoughts. I am scared I am going to slide back into self hatred when I have been getting so much more confident…

Taking my medication while I’m there is honestly just not an option because of the activity, It’s a really hilly area and I feel short of breath even without the added stress of stimulants in my system dealing with it. 
(I likely have POTS and hEDs my brother is officially diagnosed I’m just waiting to get in)

I’m going to have to raw dog life for a bit and the guilt of needing my medication is already creeping in… I know it’s normal, it’s logical, I have ADHD everyday why wouldn’t I feel better when I medicate it everyday? That little voice in the back of my head is still sneering I’m some addict…. That voice will only take centre stage again when I’m alone with my rampant uncontrolled ADHD thoughts. 


The real answer to all of this: 

my god I need to get back into therapy for my self hatred paranoia fuelled OCD…. I’m so sick of dealing with the little hater in my mind trying to ruin my mood. ";r/adhd_anxiety;4;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mll6sy/tolerance_break/
2025-08-09 01:34:41;Did anyone else overthink their first ADHD med way too much?;"Even after I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid I looked at that bottle of pills and could not take the first pill until days later. I would keep reading the list of side effects, googling each and every symptom and keeping myself convinced that that is somehow how I am going to feel as some crazy new person.  
  
My personal tip would be to keep in mind it is not a lifetime commitment, it is just data gathering to start meds. You give it a go, you experience it and how you feel you modify it with your doctor. And side effects are possible, although in the majority of cases they are not dramatic or severe.

2025-08-09 01:08:04;Diagnosed with ADHD from Doctor, but should I see a Psychiatrist instead?;"Hi, 

I (34F) was diagnosed with ADHD from my general doctor back in 2017. She had me take a test and answer some questions after I told her how much I was struggling, how depressed I was, and how I would stuff my face until I was so disgusted with myself I would purge it all out.   
  
Ultimately, she put me on Vyvanse 10mg to 30mg later, to help with my ADHD and my binge eating. She also prescribed me anti-depressant, which I admit I only took a few times and then quit, because I just don't like taking medication. For instance, I always had to restart my birth controls cause I just hated taking pills. But, Vyvanse? That was a Godsend, I was a new person. I will take! My entire life, I always felt I was dumb and incredibly insecure.. school was not easy for me growing up, I always felt like I had to try twice as hard than the person next to me. I was always zoning out and daydreaming. Even in college, my motto was ""pay attention, focus"" and as soon as the professor would start talking, my mind wandered off and I would catch myself saying, ""What happened?!"" I started recording lectures so I can go back and listen in case I drifted off. Homework and essays, it took so much effort for me to feel ""motivated"" to start. And, if I did get sparks of motivation to do a hobby, but that spark quickly fizzles out and is left never finished.   
  
With Vyvanse, The zoning out during conversations, gone! I was not interrupting people mid-conversation, I could actually carry a conversation. My relationships with people and boyfriend (now husband) improved! Cause yeah, he tells me he can tell when I stop listening. I was happier, because I was productive. I wanted to do things, and clean up my doom piles around the house. Two weeks into taking it, my boss stopped me in the hallway after a meeting, and gave me a huge compliment pointing out that he's noticed how I seem like a different person, how on ""top of it"" I've been. Normally, I am having to go back and ask them to repeat themselves until the information sunk in. But, now? It's like... wearing glasses for the first time, and being able to see clearly, or the fog has cleared and I can process hear, and understand. Lastly, I was no longer purging myself. 

Fast forward, in 2020  I moved cities and had to find a new doctor. This brought in a lot of insecurities because my new doctor questioned me how I was diagnosed, made it clear she doesn't feel comfortable prescribing a controlled substance that wasn't diagnosed from a Psychiatrist. Though, because I have been taking it for years, she will prescribe it. But, I have to go in every three months to see her (even though I only take it on the weekdays, so I'm usually left with a surplus and with my previous doctor, I saw her every 6 months for a refill). I'm also randomly drug tested during my visits. I understand that's part of their process/code, but I can't help but feel so insecure. Like, she doesn't believe that I have ADHD unless I was diagnosed from a psychiatrist and that I'm a fraud. I'm now taking 40mg, and somedays my heart rate races so much, and my anxiety worsens, I know it's a side affect, but I'm too afraid to bring it up so I act nonchalant about it, afraid she may not prescribe something that has been helping me get through the day at work. Can I live without it, yeah. I stopped taking it while I was pregnant and while I was breastfeeding. But, just like wearing glasses it makes it easier. 

Anyway, do you think I should meet with a Psychiatrist to validate my diagnosis? Or keep going to the same doctor because she is prescribing what I need, it just comes with making me feel insecure. What do you guys think? Looking for support to help validate my feelings.";r/adhd_anxiety;7;4;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1ml0xct/diagnosed_with_adhd_from_doctor_but_should_i_see/
2025-08-08 15:54:52;For those who got late diagnosed and medicated, did you notice a difference in how you functioned in romantic connections (in regards to both forming and maintaining them) pre-stimulant and post-stimulant usage?;"Hey guys, I am very curious regarding this because during the short period of my life where I was able to use stimulants, I was significantly more capable in forming and maintaining positive connections with the opposite sex, including romantic connections. I was suddenly very popular with girls my age. Before my stupid psychiatrist blocked me from taking any more meds without justification and I completely crashed. Suddenly, I was very unpopular with girls once again. All the original problems with anxiety around conversations, oversharing, being impulsive, etc. came back. Never had a positive experience since other than group assignment acquaintances in high school and university. 

What about with you guys? How did stimulant usage impact your abilities in forming and maintaining romantic connections?

2025-08-08 07:06:22;I need some advice.;"Hello
First time posting on reddit but I always come to reddit for tips and see what others think by other peoples posts but here I am. If I'm in the wrong spot to post this just LMK.
I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2012. I was in the Army then we were close to deploying. I feel like I was honestly being used for my ADHD because I would take on like 20 tasks at a time and get them all done i was like the power of 10 men. 
Come now to 2025 and this past month I have had a great time and a bad time on Adderal XR 20mg, started at 10mg. Today 07 AUG 2025 i have my 30 day checkup with my psychiatrist. I have called her 2 times since the first day to ask for a raise in adderal bevause it was not working. I literally keep a tracker with a graph chart of 90% of my symptoms and you can see them each fluctuate 4-5 days after my increase. But those 4-5 days actually stay constant with every increase until they don't. 
I have also noticed I get a little itchy not sure if that is dehydration or a allergic reaction. I read on a few other posts people were itchy but it was due to dehydration from adderal. 
So I guess I'm here asking what should I do? Should I keep increasing or should I switch to something different. 
I should also mention that my body burns through everything I put in my mouth so fast. I had a vasectomyand shoulder surgery and I had to double up my pain meds each time due to them doing nothing on a single dose. I asked the doctor before I did that. 
I have gotten so much done because I can focus and pay attention. I can actually listen and process what my wife says and not zone out and think about other stuff. I respect and Love her and I feel so bad because I get distracted so easy. ""Squirrel"" She started to see my meds working from a outside perspective 3 days ago but now they arent. She thinks I should keep increasing till something takes. I am here wanting 3rd opinion, to see what everyone who is on ADHD meds thinks. 

Thank You everyone

Update: 08 AUG 25. my psychiatrist bumped me to 30mg. She said 40mg is the highest. The same night I talked to her I started feeling slight pressure on my left chest area. My BP was 123/ 87 with a 73 pulse and 95 O. Today when writing this I realized I think I forgot to take yesterday's dose. On the other hand, this does not explain the days before, when meds were not working well or at all. Also itchiness is down by half not sure why/how, but ain't complaining.

2025-08-08 03:56:50;Managing college life and medications;I am 18 years old and will be starting college in about a month. I have diagnosed ADHD and Anxiety and I take 20 mg of lexapro and 20 mg of aderall to manage it. Throughout high school I didn’t ever drink or party because my friend group wasn’t really into that and I was also in the trenches getting my mental health sorted out at the time. However going into college I am excited about the social aspect of drinking and partying but I’m worried I will have a bad reaction because of my medications. I assume I would already have a low tolerance to begin with since I’ll be new to drinking and I’m worried that my medications will make it worse. I know that if I ask my doctor about this they will just tell me it’s safest not to drink but I want to know what experiences others have had drinking while on meds?;r/adhd_anxiety;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mka9lf/managing_college_life_and_medications/
2025-08-07 20:34:54;I feel lost;"Hi! I am a 25-year-old male, I have been diagnosed with autism, ADHD, OCD, dyslexia and anxiety, I feel super stressed and without motivation to live. My favorite hobbies are making art and playing video games. I've never had a fixed job, but I've been able to sell a lot of art, but I feel like I have a weird learning disability that I've never been able to understand. I feel very pressured because I need make money, but I do not have the courage to find any job because I get super anxious and whenever I think about it I end up feeling like giving up on life. I've tried to start a tattoo business, but I have a hard time learning more and improving in addition to having social anxiety. I feel some hope that is gradually fading away. Sometimes I feel that I am too emotional and stressed and I hate myself too much for being like this, I hate my personality and sometimes I do not understand my role in this life.

2025-08-07 17:16:09;Is this ADHD?;"I’m so scared. Everyday there is an episode. I’m having an emotional breaking point. It’s hard for me to write, because I’m emotionally upset. I think with my postpartum, anxiety, and depression— everything is building up. 

Today, I told my husband to take our daughter (9 months old infant) for stroller walking, because she was feeling fussy and she stayed home all day. I told him if he can pick up the mail, while I prepare dinner. He goes and does what I told him to do. He comes back home. Our daughter fell asleep in the stroller. He leaves the stroller with the mail, Amazon box, car keys, and our daughter’s sippy cup — everything in the stroller outside on our porch. He picks up our daughter and comes inside the house. I’m not paying attention fully because I’m cooking other than making sure they’re both home safe and sound. I see him sitting on the sofa with her. She eventually wakes up. He is eating. He wants to feed her. I already fed her beforehand, but he wants to give her food again. I’m like sure. He gave her part of his food where it was spicy — not knowing. She wants her sippy cup because she feels spiciness . My husband asks me “can you get her sippy cup from outside? 

I’m like what? That’s when I went outside and noticed he left stroller with mail, keys, her sippy cup outside. We live in the south. There will be mosquitoes and flies flying from time to time. It has been raining constantly. 

That’s the only sippy cup that she is able to drink from successfully at the moment without spilling. I got the sippy cup. Guess what? It already had a fly on it. I had to wash it to make sure it’s not dirty and sterilize it.

I’m getting emotional. One, because my daughter is crying b/c he gave her something spicy without noticing it. And two, I’m trying my fastest to give her water and sterilizing the sippy cup. 

I asked him feeling emotionally upset- when are you going to see the doctor for ADHD diagnosis? 

He gets upset. He tells me “ENOUGH”. He doesn’t want to talk about it. But he said that he told me to get the stuff from the stroller earlier when he walked in but that I didn’t hear him…. I’m like “why couldn’t you say it again”… “if I didn’t hear you in the kitchen??”

Also, why couldn’t he put mail and keys inside the entrance table first and then take her out of the stroller… the distance from our entrance door to entry way table is pretty minuscule. 

If this was isolated issue. I wouldn’t have over reacted. But constantly every day.. every hour … something happens… 

I have to keep reminding him of bills like mortgage. He forgets when they need to be owed. He had speeding ticket from September where he had not only pay a fine but to take traffic school. I kept reminding him weekly then daily to attend his traffic school, so Judge doesn’t suspend his driver’s license. After 10 months, he finally completed in July. Luckily, the state didn’t suspend his driver’s license.

He also had $2,000 tolls unpaid that I did not know when we got married. He kept postponing it and the tolls fines kept accruing. I told him let’s open a credit card with 0% Apr for 24 months and we can pay it off without interest accruing. 

The other day, our daughter had swimming practice. I told him the vacuum isn’t working as I’m getting my daughter ready for swimming class and packing her stuff. We are on crunch time. But he starts looking at the vacuum sitting down like it’s  some fun science project … and forgets that we have to leave and take her to her swimming class. I’m upset because we were going to be late. It’s a 30 minute class. Losing time even 5-10 mins of class— it’s like money going down the drain. I couldn’t go alone with my daughter because I need help when I dress her and dress myself after swimming. Why couldn’t he look at the vacuum after swimming class?  

Every time he has an appointment, he is always late. 

Am I overreacting? Is this ADHD? Or is this regular marriage stuff that I wasn’t aware? We have been together for 10 years.

2025-08-06 20:42:48;Seeking advice on specific situation that icludes a lot of side effects.;"\*To reassure you right away, this post is not a request for advice on how to dose medication.\* I have a specific plan outlined by my doctor, and I’m sticking to it, but I lack points of reference to know what to expect. I’m a bit afraid of this trial-and-error process, so I’m looking for people who have gone through a similar medication and dosage adjustment as prescribed by my doctor. My treating physician didn’t explain certain things to me, and I didn’t ask the right questions because I didn’t know what to ask. So, I’m navigating this blindly, and I also can’t find any active support groups in my area. I don’t know what to expect, and I’m struggling with a lot of side effects that are hard to manage. I understand that everyone’s experiences vary, but I haven’t found anything similar to my situation.

If I should post it somewhere else please direct me. I tried to post in few groups that seem to be inactive, in some my post was deleted with no reason.

I’ve been on \*18 mg of methylphenidate (Atenza)\* for 10 days. I’m 40 years old, and this is my first time taking this medication. In the morning, I drink a light coffee, and in the evening, I take \*25 mg of Trittico (trazodone)\* to help me sleep.

I’ve been cycling through a lot of side effects: \*loss of appetite, facial tics, irritability, apathy, depressive episodes, dissociation/derealization (""teleportation"" feeling), dizziness, and concentration issues\* (I often walk into rooms and forget why, though I also recall my purpose much faster than before).

Additionally: \*tunnel vision, hyperactivity\* (I rearranged my entire furniture in the first few days), \*verbal diarrhea, constant headaches, tooth pain from jaw clenching, itchy skin, cold fingers but a hot face, trouble falling asleep, yet very deep sleep with easy wake-ups.\*

About \*6 hours after taking the meds, I crash\* (the effect is much shorter than advertised), and in the evening, I have \*uncontrollable negative thought spirals\*. A funny little bonus is that my sense of smell has sharpened, but \*everything smells disgusting to me.\*

\*I feel worse than before starting the medication.\*

Even though my doctor told me my diagnosis is clear-cut, I’m now doubting whether it’s accurate. From what I’ve read, the \*intensification of negative symptoms\* I’m experiencing is typical for people who \*don’t have ADHD\* but start taking stimulants. It feels like the things people with ADHD want to eliminate have \*gotten significantly worse for me\* on meds.

According to the plan, in a few days (after 2 weeks at 18 mg), I’m supposed to increase to \*27 mg\*, then after another 2 weeks to \*36 mg\*, and so on until I find the ""sweet spot."" But I’m skeptical whether \*increasing the dose will actually reduce these side effects\* I’m dealing with now.

The internet tells me conflicting things. I \*think\* I feel slightly better than a few days ago, but since I have no prior experience with these meds, I’m not sure if it makes sense to keep increasing the dose.

Today, I consulted a psychiatrist who additionally prescribed me \*fast-acting Medikinet 10 mg\* to try in the coming days. But after this experiment, I’m supposed to go back to increasing the Atenza dose (27 mg, then 36 mg). My next appointment isn’t until September.

The doctor also told me that \*to counter the crash from Atenza, I can take 10 mg of Medikinet in the early afternoon\* to extend the medication’s effect.

With that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. \*Is combining these medications okay?\* Taking \*Atenza 18/27/36 mg in the morning and Medikinet 10 mg in the early afternoon\* to prolong the effect? Does anyone have experience with this kind of dosing and switching between brands?
2. From what I’ve read, different brands with the \*same dosage\* differ in their \*IR (immediate-release) and MR (modified-release) ratios\*-for example, Atenza is \*18/82%\*, while Concerta is \*22/78%\*, which affects how the meds feel despite the ""same"" dose. \*Does the brand actually make a difference in your experience?\* Most opinions I’ve seen focus on release mechanisms, but anecdotal reports suggest that switching brands with the same dose can feel different.
3. \*Are there people here who had severe side effects but found that increasing the dose actually helped?\* It seems counterintuitive that a \*lower dose would cause more side effects than a higher one\*. Can it really work that way?
4. \*Is experimenting with doses (18, 10, 27 mg) in such a short time frame a good idea?\* Shouldn’t I space this out more?
5. \*Do ""medication breaks"" (1-3 days off) negatively impact long-term treatment?\* Methylphenidate doesn’t accumulate in the body, but some people say that after short detoxes, they feel like they’re ""starting from zero."" \*Is this just placebo?\*
6. \*Is the consensus really that you have to try different doses and release formulations until something finally works?\* That sounds a bit horrifying...

Im objectively decently smart and I like the way I work through things in my head I just hate my inability to focus on things for longer periods of time. I cant watch YouTube videos with stories anymore because I will lose focus and everything eill fog over and ill lose an hour doing nothing and not retaining any information.

2025-08-06 08:02:46;Here's a reminder that you can achieve that goal, and you deserve to 🤗;"Just for context, I'm in the UK. When I turned 17, as is the rite of passage here, most of my friends passed their driving tests. I got through 2 instructors, X4 failed tests, and, as I was undiagnosed, confusion and frustration turned to self hatred. I used to genuinely sit on the floor and cry after driving lessons. My instructors would complain of me 'zoning out' or going blank. I now interpret most of my difficulties through the lense of undiagnosed ADHD.

For much of my childhood, my dad would tell stories of his time out on a motorcycle. Riding around France, getting into bashes, annoying his parents. I was intrigued. I took a taster lesson in between my patchy driving career - and it went surprisingly well. 

Fast forward to last month, and in a moment of post diagnosis clarity I thought: 'Fuck it'. I booked myself in for the bike CBT. 

Waking up today I felt like I made a big mistake. I hated myself and as bracing myself to fail miserably. Granted, I had picked a riding school that purposefully did CBTs with people on automatic scooters to ease them in and help get them to a pass. But.....I DID IT! I PASSED! Granted, I'm getting another lesson in to build my confidence on a manual...but...I DID IT! 

Never in a MILLION years would I have imagined I'd be given the golden ticket of being able to ride my own motorcycle, explore and get myself from A to B without relying on unpredictable buses and Ubers. 

I just came here to say - if you have a goal or dream that's felt impossible because of your ADHD, it might still be possible. Give yourrself the chance to prove yourself wrong. If you don't get it, at least you'll have the satisfaction of trying. 

TLDR: I never thought I'd be able to but today I passed my CBT (compulsory basic training) to ride a motorcycle!! Fellow ADHDers - we CAN do this 💪";r/ADHDers;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1mipom0/heres_a_reminder_that_you_can_achieve_that_goal/

2025-08-05 08:33:58;Buspar or Strattera: side effects;"
I’m not really sure how to start this, but here goes…

I (50f) was diagnosed with anxiety in my 20s. Tried Lexapro. Hated it (numbed everything, bad or good). Went over 10 years without meds and did fine. In my 40s I realized my near constant anger might actually be anxiety rearing its ugly head again. Took Zoloft. Meh. It was fine for the anxiety, I guess, but it came with some really unsavory GI issues, so I stopped taking it. 

Things have gotten a lot worse—I struggle with racing thoughts, procrastination, time suck, severe overstimulation in crowds/noisy situations, memory issues, impatience with slow people/talkers, etc. A few months ago I started researching ADHD, specifically late diagnoses in women, and it seems like a legitimate possibility.

Today I met with a psych NP. I hated him and felt like he completely dismissed my concerns (which is a whole other thing I now have to figure out), but he did offer to prescribe either Buspar or Strattera. In fact, he seems quite keen on fixing something we aren’t even sure how to define. “Is it anxiety? Is it ADHD? Who cares!? Let’s throw something at it and see if it sticks.”

But I digress.

While I wait for the referral to go through for further testing, which I’m told will probably not happen for several months because they’re backed up, I need to decide whether I want to try one of these medications.

I am aware that the effectiveness of both medications varies widely from one person to the next. I’m sure that’s true of side effects as well, but I have serious concerns about any side effects related to stomach or intestinal issues. I guess I’m looking to hear how bad the nausea or constipation can actually be (or is vomiting or diarrhea a real concern at all)? Not that anyone wants to deal with either of those things, but my job makes it particularly difficult to take breaks on an as-needed basis, so any urgency that might exist related to these things makes me think I’d rather continue being neurotic and not coping well.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you. ";r/adhd_anxiety;6;15;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mhus3d/buspar_or_strattera_side_effects/
2025-08-04 16:53:05;Severe anxiety despite meds;"Hey everyone,

I got diagnosed with ADHD about 3 months ago — kind of by accident. I originally went to a psychiatrist for severe anxiety. At the time I was on benzos, which led to addiction (not proud, but it happened).

We started proper diagnosis and treatment. I was put on methylphenidate (mph) and duloxetine. I also quit benzos — I’ve been clean for 28 days now. That already helped a bit, but my anxiety was still too intense, so we adjusted the meds: switched to extended-release mph (now on the max dose), and added pregabalin + quetiapine twice a day.

Even with all that, getting out of bed is still terrifying. I’m constantly scared I’ll have a panic attack. It’s been 3 weeks on the current meds — no attacks so far — but the fear is still there every single day.

I’m going to NA meetings and opening up about everything, which helps a little, but not enough. I’m avoiding friends, and when I have to go to work, I do — but I’m anxious the entire time.

What really messes with me is this: I’m scared of feeling happy or okay again… because I don’t trust it. I’m scared that the moment I feel good, the panic attacks will come back and hit even harder. It’s like I don’t even let myself hope, just to avoid being crushed again.

Has anyone else felt this way? How do you deal with the fear of relapse or that constant sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop? Any advice or experience would help so much.";r/adhd_anxiety;7;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mh898n/severe_anxiety_despite_meds/

i started realising i may have adhd when i started uni, after about a year and half and a thorough research i decided to share this thought with my psychiatrist who has been treating me for my long life anxiety. we talked (for about two hours lol) and he decided to try putting me on atomoxetine and do some more tests and stuff. well, through the next three months i started noticing slight improvements like feeling body cues, less fidgeting, more patience and so and so as well as the exam season being the most easy out of all the exam seasons i’ve been through. i actually felt that living is somehow easier now. after these 3-4 months and lots of talks with my doctor, he really diagnosed me with adhd. 

but this period has been really difficult for me in the case of my anxiety disorder and i had to be put on sertraline to stabilise the worst of my anxiety. after about a month of taking sertraline (and after going through all the side effects, you know how it is) i started noticing that majority of my adhd problems started coming back. for example body cues, problems with deciding, focus, patience etc. which has been really troubling me because now i knew what it feels like living on the easier mode and i also started doubting all these months on atomoxetine and the whole diagnosis of adhd, you know, asking myself, what if i am really making this whole thing up? 

now i am in the process of coming of the sertraline because the anxiety problem has been stabilised and i really hope that the atomoxetine effects will return. i also intend to talk about this all with my doctor but until then i decided to ask here if someone had been through something similar and sertraline could really be affecting the atomoxetine effects. 

sorry that this is kinda long but i felt that i need to explain everything in order for someone to understand the whole problem. ";r/adhd_anxiety;2;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1mgrbbl/sertraline_and_atomoxetine_combo/

Hey guys so I am getting prescribed ADHD medication at the end of the month and I truly would appreciate some advice like what was the appointment like for you? How was your follow ups with finding the right dose, and just general information. I have some documents from childhood I am bringing to my appointment aswell and would love some general guidance, I’ve attached them to the post, is there anything else I should bring. For some background I’m seeing this psychiatrist after a long period with a mental health provider who I have been for over a year.

For reference I am 22 years old and I don’t have a relationship with my mum since she struggled with addiction, so any advice with how you went with medication would be great to hear as I was reluctant to start medication for a long time because of my family life. Is the information enough, it is really hard to get information from my childhood due to the situation. I was also first diagnosed as a child but was unmedicated due to the things I mentioned above.

Some things I struggle with include:

Coping with feeling overwhelmed.

I self-medicate with food, alcohol, vaping/ smoking.

Dopamine seeking behaviour — not to feel “high,” but to when I’ve drank in the past I feel like I can function better than dealing with my brain sober.

Avoidance Behaviors are common because I am overstimulated or in emotional pain.(putting things off, isolating, withdrawing from people and feeling numb because I feel so overwhelmed)

I shift between overworking, shutdown and burning out fast. I have had 14 jobs in total and the longest being 1 year.

Struggles with work / employment “I’m bored, distracted, overstimulated, unmotivated.”

Struggles with executive function: planning, prioritising, starting, finishing tasks, remembering details.

Feeling shame when productivity doesn’t match potential.

I stay up late scrolling or dissociating, then feel drained and guilty in the morning. Rest doesn’t feel restful it feels like a delay in productivity.

“Even when I’m tired, I can’t switch off.”

I feel unsafe, on alert, and emotionally flooded constantly.

Struggles with hypervigilance, panic, emotions, or shutdowns at times I feel trapped in stressful or high-demand environments.

I no longer have a stutter but did in childhood from ages 1 - 12

I also struggle with food and binging

I apologise for the dumping of all this information about me 😂 just seeking some advice on how your own experience with getting medicated and your treatment journey was.

I heavily relate to a lot of experiences described here and other ADHD communities have a lot of trouble managing my energy, time, and interests. Also talked with my sisters, 3 of which have similar symptoms, stories, struggles in workplaces or with managing hobbies and such, and 2 outright suspect they have ADHD. 
It seems pretty common that people go to check for ADHD and instead get diagnosed with anxiety or depression, or both. I don't have depression but i got diagnosed with anxiety without having to go into too much detail about it so it was obviously bad enough to notice. Got prescribed prozac. 4 weeks later, no changes at all besides some nightmares and exhaustion in the first 3 weeks.
What should i do? I'm thinking of waiting till the 2 month mark then insisting my doctor reconsider ADHD as the symptoms still affect me and CBT has yet to help me in any way. Or should i get a 2nd opinion? Or am i not thinking straight here? I'm hopeful things will end in a positive way for me in therapy but i'd appreciate advice on how i can make sure my psychiatrist takes me seriously, especially considering my age.

2025-08-03 01:14:09;What should I expect from the medication?;"Hi everyone. 
A bit of back story.

I'm a 32 year old Australian male who was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. Use to take Ritalin twice a day from memory. Back then it helped me out a lot, went from failing school to acing every subject. But then my parents just stopped taking me back and I went off the meds cold turkey. Grades started dropping and I began to struggle again at school however I was still better then pre meds. My parents didn't explore the possibility of putting me back on the meds again. 

Come year 11, I was wanting to work in Finance cause Maths was my best subject (I use to makey own algebraic sums at home when I was bored just to understand the interactions between formulas) however my step mum told me I would never be able to get an office job and I should do manual labour. The next 15 years after that I spent bouncing between jobs, trying to find a physical job that I found engaging enough to keep my attention. I finally had enough last year and I got a job at a call centre working on an account for a superannuation company. I finally thrived at something. 5 months after that I got a promotion to a Real Time Analyst. It finally feels like I am doing something I love. 

However, I feel slow. I can sometimes struggle to start a task and lose track of where I am at. ive caught myself just zoning out sometimes even though I really need and want to get something done but it's like my mind does a reset. I was going to push through it and let my brain adjust to the new things that are being asked of it but on my birthday lunch with my sister she mentioned that when we were younger, my dad paid for us both to do an IQ test. I can't remember this but I honestly can't remember any of my childhood bar a flash of a memory here and there. My sister told me she got 140ish (She is working in Law currently) and I was in the high 150's. This was very shocking to me cause honestly I am constantly thinking I am slow. I get frustrated at myself cause I struggle to do things that other people do everyday.

The reason for wanting you to understand this is cause after learning of that, I am considering trying to get back on some medication. But honestly I don't know what I should expect. I would appreciate hearing some other people's stories about how it helped them. What changes the medication made for you. Can
 I expect a change like when I was a kid or will it be different now since I am older.

2025-08-02 01:48:34;do any of you guys suffer from ocd too? many people claim i’m autistic but i think im just more sensitive than other people;"i have had adhd for my whole life and only diagnosed about a year ago with combined symptoms of inattentive and hyperactive. i struggle with ocd too (not diagnosed but i know that i struggle with intrusive thoughts and hypersensitivity to messes or things being out of order plus i have hard time not carrying a thousand things in my purse just in case i need it). 

However, a lot of people mistake my adhd and ocd symptoms as factors of me potentially being autistic. I have been told I speak in a monotone tone often and that i don’t understand social norms and/or I’m too blunt. I personally believe that I don’t like playing games to get to a point. Things in my opinion are very obvious from the start and when you call them out, people get mad at me. Sometimes they say i even look, sound, or act autistic. I am not saying being autistic is bad, i relate to autistic people a lot as I know adhd and autistic symptoms overlap and display similarly. But for me i feel like some people specifically men and a handful of women seriously try to take a jab at me by labeling me as autistic when i do something i believe is related to my ocd or adhd instead. 

One thing, i know about ocd is that it is anxiety disorder so i feel most people label my anxiety as autism which further complicates why people misunderstand me and why i misunderstand myself.

2025-07-31 21:08:38;ADHD meds and anxiety/panic attacks - will they help or make it worse?;"I’m seeking a diagnosis as an adult, with the goal of trying medication. I’ve suspected for a long while now that I could have ADHD but it’s only gotten worse with age, especially since I graduated and started working. The forgetfulness and lack of motivation is so debilitating! If meditation can make things even 10% easier I’d consider it worth it.

The trouble is, I’m a pretty anxious person and have panic attacks sometimes in specific situations. I’m prescribed Propranolol which has been a godsend for this, it stops all the physical symptoms and helps to me break out of the anxious feedback loop.

Stimulant medication is the first line of treatment for ADHD so I’d be keen to try it, but I’m a bit apprehensive of the impact it could have on my anxiety.

Everyone responds differently, but I’m curious- If you’re on stimulant medication and also have anxiety, what’s been your experience?

2025-07-31 07:24:46;help needed;"hi folks im writing here to ask for help because its been to long and im so stuck on how to get help for this. 



okay so ill try and summarise the best I can. I have for the longest time been wondering what could be wrong with me and for the past few years its clicked that it could be adhd. years of failed relationships, now currently in a relationship where it feels as if I've done so many things to mess up and she's not left me. I worry about going out due to people looking at me, feeling unwanted/ unattractive, im very very closed off. I barely speak to anyone, a lot of the time me and my partner sit in silence because talking really frustrates me. I can't multitask. if someone asks me to do something or speaks to me while im reading or concentrating on something I really struggle to focus on it. not that I can concentrate on anything these days. I have literally no interests, anything I do get into I eventually lose interest in over a matter or days. I used to game every day when I was young. would finish any game I ever had within hours. now I buy games. play for 2 mins then never play again ( impulse buying) I've just spent £500 on music production software. only to realise im no good at it so that's in the bin. anyone I seem to meet im so over the top and hyper with and it puts people off me, I have legit no friends. no-one talks to me. no-one comes to see me/ asks if im okay/ recently turned 30 and no-one reached out to wish me happy birthday. even writing this I know its a mess and am thinking it over in my head, I've rewriting this 5 times now because I just don't know what to do anymore. for the past few months I have been taking strips of tablets In the hope that when I sleep it will kill me. I feel like im just here waiting to die. I don't want to die but I don't feel like I should be here. I feel as if im not good enough for my family even though im told im a very very good dad to my 2 kids, and im the most caring person for them and so protective. ( my dad left when I was small) and I know its adhd I've got but the nhs doesn't want to pay attention to it. say they don't have the funding for it. can't afford a private doctor so im really at a loss. what the hell do I do because for once I want to feel as if I should actually be here. its impacting my life so much. my sex life basically doesn't exist. not because its not there. but because my body and mind are so closed off. I barely speak to my partners mum and dad as much as they do everything for me. everyone I just feel thinks that im weird because im so closed off and I just want to feel normal for once before I do end up somehow killing myself. I really just feel like im here to wait for dying. 

  
and im so sorry I've wrote this as a mess, I've typed it terribly, I don't feel as if I've put across what I mean properly either so I apologise, I just want someone to actually get me diagnosed with this because its ruining my life and my family's ";r/ADHDers;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1mdlvd7/help_needed/
2025-07-30 05:10:56;Does anyone else with ADHD experience sleep issues in a cycle?;"So I’m in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD my doctor thinks I definitely have it and has referred me to a psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis.

One thing I’m really trying to understand is my sleep. Since early childhood, I’ve always had trouble falling asleep. It usually takes me 3–4 hours to fall asleep, and sometimes I struggle to stay asleep too.

But here’s the weird part  my sleep issues seem to come in cycles. For around 6–8 months, I’ll barely sleep maybe 4 hours a night and it’s a real struggle. Then, for the next 3–4 months, I’ll suddenly sleep really well, like 8–10 hours (even though it still takes me a while to fall asleep). And then the cycle repeats.

I’m wondering if this is an ADHD thing? Or is sleep disruption in ADHD usually constant? I understand ADHD is a spectrum and everyone’s experience is different, but many of our struggles do overlap. I’d love to hear if anyone else goes through something similar.

2025-07-27 09:06:12;How do I deal with the guilt of being a bad partner to my ex?;"I’m really struggling to process the dynamic of my relationship that ended 7 weeks ago. 

It’s a very long story but at the time we met, I didn’t realise I had ADHD. When I met my partner she told me she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I researched all I could about borderline personality disorder as I wanted to gain insight and understanding in how I could support her. Having undiagnosed and untreated ADHD myself at the time, we’d end up triggering one another. 

My ex had an extreme fear of abandonment and with my ADHD I would often struggle with conflict. Any raised voices and yelling had me put my walls up and after hours of not feeling like we were getting anywhere I would often ask for space and take days to process what had happened. I struggled to work out if I was in the wrong, if we both were and how to move forward. I sometimes would feel manipulated and confused and couldn’t make sense of things and I would question myself if the issues my partner was expressing were true. Was I really neglecting my partner etc.

There were very clear times I know I wasn’t. For example my ex would say it didn’t feel like I was engaged or interested in chatting as I wasn’t responding often while studying, yet when I scrolled through to check because I know I do have time blindness,  I was responding within 2 minutes. From my partners perspective I shouldn’t have been putting my study over her but from my perspective, I had asked if she was able to see me that weekend, she expressed she wasn’t able to so I thought okay I could prioritise my studies, I can call her after a few hours of study (still texting with her during) and then when she had the day off I could focus my time on her, knowing I’d caught up on my uni work and I could be fully present for her when we were together. 

There were other times, I definitely was not a good partner. I’d constantly run late. Sometimes by around 5 or 10 minutes, other times to the point she’d have to leave and I’d still be getting ready and then she’d have to come back and get me after she’d dropped the kids off. I had time blindness and would say I’m coming to bed soon or “in a minute.” That minute would end up being 40 mins. 

I dealt with chronic pain which led to depression and I didn’t know at the time but I now know it was ADHD paralysis and low dopamine that caused me to just lose my drive. I fell into a deep depression and while I was there in the house, I was withdrawn. Hot and cold. My RSD would play up and I’d have a fear of being vulnerable and initiating affection because if I perceived there was any rejection, I’d shut down on put up walls and it would start fights because I would need validation. Other times I would feel safe to let my adhd mask down and it felt amazing to be able to be so vulnerable and I was being affectionate and receiving the affection I loved so much. When I was cold my partner felt like I wasn’t interested in her or and she felt unloved and it would confuse her when I’d be loving again. I felt truly myself when my walls were down and it felt great to be so close and loving with her. I never wanted to pull away and not have affection but my actions didn’t show that whenever my RSD was flared up. 

My ex basically became my carer at one point when I had chronic pain and depression. She picked up all the slack with the housework. She did everything. Got my meals, my drinks. I felt so ashamed of relying on her and so down about myself that I withdrew further. Eventually she said the resentment just got too much and she said she felt like a slave/carer more than my partner. The resentment turned into her throwing my belongings and clothes outside and kicking me out because she just couldn’t take it anymore. She’d yell at me and call me lazy, swear at me and there was a lot verbal abuse. She’d immediately feel bad and beg me to come back and said she just snapped because she couldn’t handle it anymore. 

I recently left and we started seeing each other again and at this point I have been in therapy with a new therapist and really trying to work on these issues. My partner even recognised this but said she can see improvement in x, y but z needs more improvement but with the effort I was making we could get through it. 

The last time we saw each other we had a disagreement where she ended up throwing food I had cooked. It frightened me and she said it was her OCD. A lot happened since then and things were taken out of my hand when I opened up to a counsellor. The counsellor reported the incident to police and the police contacted me and long story short after discussing and confirming what my counsellor divulged, they insisted upon a restraining order. I didn’t want that but I had no choice. Now I’m stuck because I feel like I caused all of this. My RSD flared up that day and that really kicked off that argument.

2025-07-26 23:35:29;Why I stopped saying “I have ADHD”;"For the longest time, I’ve wanted to tell people that I have ADHD, especially when I screw something up or act in a way that seems “off.” But saying “Sorry, I have ADHD” never felt quite right. It usually lands wrong, like I’m making excuses, or the other person doesn’t really know how to respond.

Lately though, I’ve started doing something that feels better: instead of naming the diagnosis, I’ll just say something specific about how my brain works. Like, “Sorry, I’m really distractible,” or “That’s on me, I have a terrible memory.”

There’s something about narrowing it down to the behavior – attention, memory, time – that feels easier for other people to understand, and honestly, easier for me to say. It’s less loaded. Less clinical. If someone wants to connect the dots to ADHD, that’s their call. But I’m not putting that label in their hands.

Anyone else do this?

2025-07-25 13:10:40;If stimulant medication has proven to be successful for a patient with minimal or no side effects, why on earth would a psychiatrist put a stop to the prescriptions? What could the reasons be other than elevated blood pressure?;"One of my cousins who is diagnosed with ADHD-c (combined presenting impulsive, hyperactive and inattentive) was using stimulants for around 3 years. Everything was going well, with the medication significantly improving her ability to perform at work and even lead to her getting a promotion. She said there were absolutely NO side effects, only positives. She went for a refill prescription and her psychiatrist refused, mentioning something about ""importance of learning to handle the symptoms without drug-intervention"" and that ""she doesn't need it anymore"" and that ""extended use of amphetamines is dangerous"". WTF. She called me crying a few weeks ago regarding this, saying she doesn't know how she's going to cope coz she's doing a masters part time and is a manager at her workplace at the same time. She had to drop her subjects for this term.

This was in New Zealand btw.

So here I am with horrible experiences with psychiatrists and then there is my cousin. This story is horrifying to me. Imagining that once I start stimulants (I have 2 psychologist ADHD diagnosis - need to get a psychiatrist appointment), I will be living a happy life until it randomly gets cut off.

I guess this fear is why I haven't got diagnosed in such as long time. I always knew I had it but was scared of the essential miracle solution being taken away.

I’ve been job searching for the past few months, and the social performance of it all has ground me down. I am a very open person, so even twisting the truth a little bit makes me feel like I’m masking but 10x more intensely. I didn’t get diagnosed until I was in my 20s, so I spent my entire childhood constantly taking mental notes on what was “weird” and things I “should” be able to do and masking. I would just lie to myself and others to make it seem like I was easily functioning, but I was working 3x harder and longer to get anything done and was constantly anxious/drifting off. Once I got my diagnosis I started learning alternative ways of doing things instead of forcing myself through neurotypical ways, unlearning negative self-view, building self-efficacy, etc. etc. the usual stuff.

I’ve made a lot of progress, but the truth-stretching in cover letters and job interviews feels like I’m back to having to lie again. I especially hate the “why do you want to work here?” question. Why do I have to say some bs that we both know isn’t true? There was one place where my answer was genuine (a local cafe I have an emotional connection to) but the rest were not honest answers. I know employers must know they’re almost never getting real unfiltered answers. I mean there are careers where people are passionate, but my view rn is a job is a job and I think that’s fine as long as you do the work. I want to work here because you will give me money for my labor and I need money to live. Like why do I have to practice a flowery answer while faking a smile in my room for hours so it sounds natural when I’m talking to the interviewer?

2025-07-22 04:26:56;AuDHD in need of advice with stim issues (dysphoira, anxiety);"Hi all, **I am looking for advice in my** ***Dyspohira and Anxiety*** that is heightened much greatly by my ADHD Treatment of Stimulants (Adderall IR). It helps so much my ADHD and being more responsible like finishing my bachelors a few weeks ago in 1 year total (could never w/o stimulants), but makes certain aspects of life much harder. **If you can comment advice or thoughts on even** ***any single # point alone,*** that would be a massive help if you struggled or know someone else with a similar issue and possible solutions.

I literally can't find help anywhere else because of my different neurology, making people not understand why I react so harshly to medications and life in general :/

**Formal Diagnosis:**

*ADHD, ASD Lvl 1, Anxiety, Depression, OSA & Sleep Related Hypoventalation, Low-normal Testostorone (treated with TRT), Idiopathic Hypersomnia (really i don't think it's IH though, i think its fatigue ASD metabolic related or such.)*

Issues regarding trying to manage my disorders all concurrently:

(some are theory based as to why they are occuring but all are lived problems I expereince)

1. low dose addy might work better for not exasterbating certain symptoms (autism worsening=rigid thinking/rough socializing when dose is too high/taking things too serious/very heigtened anxiety) and emotional blunting worsens going 30mg and above. more intrinsic motivation on low doses since less emotional blunting of personally enjoyable things (think videogames or going to see a movie, which i can't even interact with above 15mg (somedays even 10mg) since higher dose makes me feel worse about being ""unproductive"" i.e. worsening autism and cant force myself to relax. current dosing regime is 3-4 IR's a day. a good day is 12.5ir > 10ir > 5ir (lower doses in negating side effects) but really bad days (especially self destructive days like further mentioned in #15) have me doing like 20ir > 15ir > 15ir > 5ir.
2. higher dose works for more extrinsic motivation but emotional blunting present >30mg paradoxically makes me stop having intrest in doing the things (fresh off tolerance break, even low 10mg doses help extrinsic motivatoin, but after weeks, the 20mg+ range is needed)
3. addy 30mg+ because of emotional blunting, helps to treat anxiety since it's numbing a lot of ALL emotion somewhat as well, indifferent to most anything (outside of the addy coming on for the first 30m-1hr)
4. when adderall comes on first thing in morning, I actually get depressed feeling and apathetic, exestensial like, never sure if it's making the dysthima or depression just more ""apparent"" or chemically causing it. I suspect a mix of both. this is worst for the first few hours in morning, and then again at night time after dinner. (see #5 below for possible link)
5. DSPS sleep disorder suspected >>> if my circadian rythym i currently sleep in (10pm-6am) is going against a more natural (4am-12pm) I wonder if that misasling causes potential cascade of metabolic issues rel. to morning depression onset with addy and/or anxiety/mood, like my body doesnt have its natural circadian peak timing resources to handle demands i'm asking of it first thing in morning. naturally a night owl and feel a peak energy start at 12pm, get's more wakeful through day. (already diagnosed and treating OSA and Sleep-related hypoventalation). morining 6am to 9am especially is such a drag and if i dont dose atleast 15mg addy, it's hard to really get around and moving.
6. Excess norep feeling from addy after lunch until bed? By this i mean, i feel really amped up nervous system wise from my addearll following my lunch and it ususally never stops until waking up the next day. once i start getting amped up, it is very hard to calm down and breathing exercises and shit dont really help. massive anxiety socially at work, espescially after I have long standing nuerologic changes (and sensory processing damage from being on Soidum Oxybate or XyWav for IH for 6 months from (Oct 2024-May 2025).
7. I tested as a poor cyp2d6 metabolizer, so even though psycoactive portion of addearll is short lived 1-3hrs, the side effects of blunting or anxity stack up regardless of the psychoactive portion being on/off since it's likely processing it out so slow.
8. ANY ssri/snri negates addearll effectivness, severely. (some norep, almost no dopa) anytime i have tried any serotonin based drug, my ADHD immediately gets so much worse and my addearll ""stimulant"" effects that let me be somewhat productive or get things done is literally cancelled. I get somewhat of the wakefulness from it still but i get irritable and the psychoactive dopamine part I dont retain, from serotonin interacting harshly with my dopamine system or such.
9. guanfacine lowered my already low norep, made me depresed feeling / emotionally blunted and lower energy. didn't really help symptoms much? (i was using adjunct to addearll for more symptom coverage hope for anxiety)
10. propanolol makes me foggy headed and disrupts my norep, makes getting up and move ability from the addy about cancelled out, lethargic feeling.
11. busprione actuallycancelled adderall effectivness the first day and immediately worsened ADHD symptoms. same with wellbutrin trial (complete block of any addearll effectiveness)
12. depression and flat feeling worsens as addy dose higher and higher, emotional blunting? too high of dopamine? (naturally enjoyed rewards diminish?)
13. i beleive i have anxiety primary and depression secondary (i believe) high anxiety and avoidance leads to depression, since i cant socialize how i want with others with high anxiety. on addearll (off it aswell but not anywhere as exasterbated) i get very aggressive and intrusive thoughts toward others and it bothers me, like PTSD like of thinking everyone at the gym is a threat to me and waching me and sizing everyone up, or even my roomate at my house who i am such good friends with, i get intrusive negative thoughts seeing him sit around playing video games for instance thinking like ""that's all you do, you're lazy"". this happens to most people a lot of the time where i get instrusive negative thoughts toward them. it doesn't make much sense, i suspect it is like a inward reflection of my internal feeling state i guess. also i anxiety mask heavy toward people, like a paranoid personality type way, where i frame myself strategically for every social situation even though it doens't help. i have a memory of being on trip with some friends and i met a cute girl, and instead of engaging and sayin hi to her to meet her formally, i instead listened to a sad song for a few hours on repeat so try and get over the fact i couldnt engage with her or try to make a friendship / romantic intrest, i just hyper obsessed it wasn't possible and coped myself. this was back in 2023 though before starting addearll in feb 2024.
14. uncomftrable taking addearll tolerance breaks for resetting addearll tolerance like how long it lasts and to use lower dose because of severity of ADHD symptoms untreated and irresponsibility like finance spending.
15. ironically even with good sleep hygeine habits and ""objectivley good"", when my addearll is ""more effective"" because my sleep quality is better it actually increases my depression feelings as i feel so serious and cant enjoy life. this causes me to be impuslive every few weeks to ""break out"" of my cabin fever and craziness feeling where i self destruct in a cycle of staying out super late and meet ladies or something or wanting to binge eat, even though these aren't my typical every day desires. paradoxically after these one night break outs, i feel a bit de-personalized the next day cause bad sleep, but i feel mentally ALOT better, becaue the addy is still working decent for symptoms, but i dont have my instrusive negative thoughts to myself and others and can be more present because of that. i can only get this sleep-dep benefit for one night though, if i do it more, i start feeling worse.

Personal thought solutions right now:

1. eliminate all carbs = night time dinner carbs about 30 minute after cause massive spike in depressive symptoms and dysphoric feeling *( but dumb enough, when high anxiety and overstimulated from work or negative thoughts = crave for carbs to try and self regulate)* this happens during lunch and dinner the cravings, to try and calm my nervous system , though paradoxically only partially helps.
2. strattera combintaion therapy for trying to use lower dose adderall for less effects like blunting and anxiety: more symptom control of - controlling emotions, time management, orginization, planning.

*I actually just saw this so i think not, since everything cancels addearll for me:* ""Atomoxetine prevents norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and has been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans.""

3. medicate with 24/7 benzo for anxiety solution because nothing else freaking helps.

4. Try medical ketamine for dysphoria symptoms and psylosybin for anxiety / mood problems?";r/adhd_anxiety;4;5;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1m5tzrt/audhd_in_need_of_advice_with_stim_issues/
2025-07-21 10:29:40;Most effective guided meditations for an ADHD brain;"Hi all! I'd appreciate any suggestions for guided meditations that keep your focus/actually help with anxiety when your ADHD brain keeps finding 5,000 ways to distract you.

For context, I'm 37 and very recently diagnosed (like 2 months ago, altho had finally suspected for about the past year). I'm also pregnant, which seems to be really exacerbating my symptoms, and with getting diagnosed during this pregnancy, I'm not taking any ADHD-specific meds.

With my first pregnancy/labor (this is my 2nd), I took a hypnobirthing class and used guided mediations provided by the class to help relax/prep for labor. Somehow, this worked well for me at the time, but those specific meditations are pretty cheesy and dated. I try to listen to them now and cringe and keep thinking about all the ways that class was unscientific and mostly nonsense, even though it worked for me, etc. etc. etc. Plus meditating in general is much more difficult now. I'm really struggling to quiet my brain (especiall at night--ended up getting prescribed trazodone to help me sleep).

Still, it was I think very helpful for me during labor to sort of go inside myself/dissociate (in a good way?!) and breathe rhythmically. I'd like to try other mediations that might be more effective. They do NOT have to be pregnancy/labor specific. Open to anything you find relaxing/quieting, and maybe the trick is it still needs to be engaging enough to keep my mind from wandering after every stray thought.

2025-07-21 04:13:25;CBD help for my Anxiety;"Hey everyone, I’m new to this subreddit and I wanted to seek some help regarding my anxiety situation. I recently got diagnosed early in March with severe ADHD and Anxiety. Since then, I have tried several ADHD medications (Vyvanse, Ritalin and now Ritalin) to help mostly with my productivity/focus because I am a full-time college student. 

One issue I always seem to fall into with the medication is this irritated, rushing, and uneasy feeling a couple of weeks into taking the meds. Recently I’ve been making many more observations of my problems with the help of my girlfriend, and I notice that many of these problems stem from anxiety symptoms. Some of these are inability to relax, impulsivity, irritation, picking at skin around my nails, etc. 

After talking to my psychiatrist, she offered to have me on both anxiety and ADHD meds, but I’m already concerned about being on one medication, and really don’t want to be on more. I’ve seen many people online/in person say and recommend CBD for a more natural anxiety reduction. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for CBD-isolate supplements/gummies that may help me reduce my anxiety throughout the day, without impacting my energy levels, focus, or productivity? ";r/adhd_anxiety;3;9;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1m4ytqm/cbd_help_for_my_anxiety/
2025-07-20 00:40:18;Vyvanse break + anxiety;"Hello!

This is my first time posting, and I'm using Google Translate... I hope my message translates well!

A little over a year ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My colleagues pointed out that it was obvious, but I've always compensated with many strategies. Being a perfectionist by nature, I've always done well. However, now in my late thirties, I feel exhausted from always figuring things out and feeling increasingly disorganized. So I consulted a doctor and received my diagnosis mixed with anxiety. I started taking Concerta, but I had major mood swings and was becoming silly without realizing it. So I switched to Vyvanse. I washed the entire house on the first day! Eventually, I was completing tasks without being exhausted. However, I started having anxiety attacks and hallucinating scenarios. Yes, I used to have a little anxiety, but I never had any attacks. The months have passed, and so have the attacks, but I feel like I'm in too much of a hurry on a daily basis. The physical symptoms of anxiety have returned (shortness of breath, tightness, general unpleasantness), and my mood is constantly raging, and I'm very impatient.

So my doctor told me to stop taking Vyvanse to see if it helped reduce my anxiety. I'm on day 4 without a stimulant (which I've been taking for a year) and I don't recognize myself anymore! Extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea...

Is it just perimenopause, anxiety, ADHD... In short, I'm tired of not feeling well!

I have two questions:

1.	⁠For those who have been through this, please tell me it's going away?! I can't take care of my family... and I'm afraid of staying like this... which causes me anxiety!
2.	⁠I don't know if I really have the right diagnosis... It seems like anxiety is taking over in the end. What medication do you take for those of you who have both?

Thank you!";r/adhd_anxiety;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1m40py5/vyvanse_break_anxiety/

I just graduated from college and am feeling completely and utterly lost. It's incredibly hard for me to think into the future consecutively and build on it, I'm able to think about my future for a day and create things in my mind and such but then it just goes away and I don't think about it for however long and then have another day where I'm thinking about myn future in an entirely different light because all I do is think I can't make anything concrete I can't build on the little details that make the big details that turn into a plan. In college, I just coasted by. I always got good grades and just did what was given to me. I don't even enjoy my major, and would never go into it. I don't even know wherre I'm going with this post, I think the only reason I'm able to write this poist is because I took an adderall today because I needed to get a bunch of stuff done, but instead it has all just hit me like a ton of bircks and I have been crying thinking about it would all just be so much easier to just not do anything and just die. I am not going to do that, of course, but I guess I'm just asking for people with debilitating adhd, how did you start your life and take control of your own life post-schooling, where the only structure in your life is the structure you create. ;r/adhd_anxiety;3;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1m36ke1/i_have_just_recently_graduated_college_and_have/
2025-07-18 06:41:32;Can ADHD coaching help me or is medication my only hope;"I am 44m diagnosed with adhd in last year. Also have had anxiety, intrusive thoughts etc m

The problem with the adhd specifically is I don’t sleep well, I am exhausted allot, I can’t focus on the boring things I need too like sorting finances, partly because of the adhd but partly anxiety. All the things I need to do to build a positive peaceful life are severely hampered by the ADHD. I need to be able to work through a todo list, I need to be able to sit down for an hour and sort my receipts and accounts ( I run my own business to make things more complicated), I need to en able to prioritise, right now I have 0 fire alarms in my mothers or my own home but am looking at air conditioning units, discussing changing the lay out which I will never get around to etc. I have a million examples like this.

The thing is I just don’t see how more coaching can help or how I can therapist my way out of this. I did have 1 session with a highly regarded adhd coach but he was taking medication. He suggested I give medication a go and then come back to him.

Lastly the medication has been disappointing. Anything that spikes my dopamine stops me sleeping. I only took vyvance for 3 days in a row before having  to stop in order to try and sleep. I tired supplements for sleep but not sleeping pills.

All in all I am fed up, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks ";r/adhd_anxiety;7;12;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1m2lowu/can_adhd_coaching_help_me_or_is_medication_my/

I have health anxiety, and a lot of it focuses on taking meds—often it takes me months or even years to work up to trying a new med. But I want to try this soon. 

I guess I’m looking for experiences where starting guanfacine was….not such a big deal? I’m worried about it wiping me out to the level of being unable to function. I’m busy right now and it’s hard to find 3 days in a row where I have nothing important on the books so I can adjust to a new med.

2025-07-12 09:14:06;Concerta - too much norepinephrine? Anxiety, overstimulation, misery.;"Hi all, I'm looking for advice. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago and treatment has gone very smooth so far - I have a wonderful psychiatrist who also has ADHD and is very open to my trials. Before this, I had suspected I had ADHD but went through multiple other trials for off-label ADHD/depression with not much success.

Wellbutrin, an NDRI was the worst by far. I had a trial of 150mg XL that went well, honeymoon ended and dose raises made me extremely irritable and on edge. I came back to this two years later and tried both 150mg XL and 100mg SR - XL was no noticeable effect but adding 100mg SR made me feel AWFUL. Wellbutrin is marketed as an NDRI but it almost exclusively acts on norepinephrine - I'm not sure how to explain what my symptoms were like, but I felt horribly on edge, paranoid, hyper-perceptive, flighty, hatred of everything. Very emotionally volatile. The excess in norepinephrine at the peak caused the most emotional misery I've experienced out of any other medication I have tried.

I'm writing this here because I'm on methylphenidate ER 36mg - I started at 18mg and it was pretty nice, but gradually trying to increase the dose because I'm not seeing any of the functional benefits I otherwise would like and it has gone very poorly the more we raise it. This is nearly the exact same reaction I have had to norepinephrine-increasing drugs in the past and it is very difficult to cope with. We decided to augment Guanfacine ER 1mg to see if it would help - it may or may not, I'm not sure yet as the dose is quite low regardless. I feel my heart beating out of my chest, so mentally overstimulated yet so physically exhausted and paralyzed. It may be psychosomatic, but there's a sensation of light pressure in the top of my head that I almost think is a physical response to feeling so overstimulated. Yet energy wise I feel utterly incapable of doing anything and it sucks, because I can't redirect this mental energy elsewhere.

I've expressed these concerns to my psychiatrist and we're going to try Vyvanse (10mg, low and slow), but I'm still a bit worried about the overstimulation ... does anyone else experience similar effects with stimulants and NRIs? Should I be looking more towards a higher dose of Guanfacine or other A2 agonists (↓ norepinephrine)?";r/adhd_anxiety;1;4;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lxnvqe/concerta_too_much_norepinephrine_anxiety/

I'm not looking for a diagnosis - I just wanted to share something that happened recently and see if anyone has had similar experiences or insights.

I got into a minor car accident recently (thankfully no one was hurt), and it's brought up a lot of thoughts for me about how I process things, especially in high-stakes or fast-moving situations like driving.

Looking back, l've noticed that sometimes I struggle with:

• Zoning out or over-focusing on one part of a task (like checking for cars in one direction but forgetting to re-check the other)
• Impatience when waiting (e.g., thinking | have enough time to turn when I don't)
• Underestimating how fast things are moving around me
• Occasionally making risky decisions when I feel pressure to act quickly
• Not noticing things in my environment, even while walking (a friend once had to pull me back from stepping into the street)

It's been kind of rattling, and I'm just trying to make sense of these patterns. I've been considering getting evaluated for ADHD, but what I really want to know is - have any of you experienced things like this? Especially when it comes to driving, attention, or how your brain processes time/speed/surroundings?

2025-07-09 07:42:56;Pristiq (SNRI) and Vyvanse;"Hi guys, I’m new!

When I was in recovery, they put me on Vyvanse (20mg) after I (finally) was diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve been on 100mg of Pristiq since last July and love it for my anxiety. Supplements I also take are 5-HTP, Lithium, B-Complex and B12 daily for mood support. 

As my anxiety got better, ADHD symptoms got worse, I felt like I wanted to ‘crawl out of my skin’ and the overlapping thoughts were LOUD prior to medication.

Anyway, Vyvanse was my first stimulant and 20mg was my first dose. At first it was amazing— I even cried at the end of the day because I couldn’t believe that was how non-ADHD brains felt. My mind was quiet and my body felt steady. I even described how I could feel the happy among the sad if I was feeling sad that day, a ‘partly cloudy’ feeling instead of just cloudy like before. 

However, once treatment ended and time passed, I couldn’t sleep, my depression worsened and I feel like I can’t function— like I was always in some state of ‘freeze’. My doctor lowered it to 10mg and I can sleep now but I still have the same depression and ‘freeze’ feeling despite my mind being quiet. 

I’m in an in between space since leaving treatment— I’m living with a family friend, job hunting and grieving the life I lived before treatment despite it being so unhealthy so environmental is a factor here. 

I’m meeting with my doctor next weekend and she wants to discuss non-stimulant and stimulant options.

2025-07-09 01:27:31;I didn’t realize how much I was masking… until I stopped;"I’m 36 and only recently got diagnosed. For most of my life, I thought I was just “too sensitive” or “lazy” or “too much.” I learned how to adapt to what everyone needed from me at school, at work, in relationships. I became a shapeshifter—great at interviews, terrible at actually keeping a job. Friendly and energetic in public, but completely shut down and withdrawn once I got home.

Since my diagnosis, I’ve been learning about masking how we develop coping strategies to hide our symptoms and appear “normal.” And wow… it hit me like a truck. I didn’t even know who I *was* when I wasn’t performing.

I realized that I never sit down unless someone is watching me. I don’t rest unless I “earn” it. I still rehearse texts like I’m going into a job interview. Even with friends, I replay conversations in my head afterward to analyze if I talked too much or overshared.

But the moment that really broke me: I went on a weekend trip alone, and for the first time in a long time, I just… *existed*. No pressure. No pretending to be “on.” I cried in a museum for no reason. I wandered for hours. I left things unfinished without guilt. And I thought, “Oh. This is what it feels like to be me.”

I’m still figuring out who that person is without the mask. It's scary but freeing. If you're also going through this, I'd love to hear what helped you stay grounded through the process. I feel like I’m grieving a version of myself I never actually was.

This is my first post ever on Reddit, so I am hoping that this turns out OK.

I wanted to share my story as I am hoping to hear from other people who have made it through what I am experiencing. I am looking for inspiration and experiences that will give me some hope to hold on to. Any advice, kind words, or personal examples of success you can provide are much appreciated.

**About me:** I am a 38-year-old male (gay); married. I consider myself to be relatively healthy, exercise daily, try to eat nutritious food for every meal, and maintain a regular sleep schedule. I live in a small town (less than 50,000 people). I am considered a “high-achiever”, self-driven and  admittedly a perfectionist. I have a strong internal critic, which is currently beating me to a pulp. Most people would describe me as kind and funny. Things that normally give me pleasure outside of work are: travelling, fitness, gardening, trying new restaurants and foods, researching interesting topics, and deep conversations with close friends.

It was confirmed in the summer of 2024 by a psychologist that I have ADHD and “broad autism phenotype” (essentially I am autistic, but the traits do not rise to the level of a disorder). I am definitely an introvert and I agree with the psychologist’s assessment that I am part of the “highly emotional people” group. Myers-Briggs classifies me as an INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging). In Attachment Theory, I am classified as having an anxious attachment type.

**Past -**  When I was in my mid-20’s, I dropped out of my PhD program due to a severe depression and anxiety, following a bad break-up, coming out and trying to navigate life on my own away from home. I moved back home, and went through what felt like an absolute nightmare; it took me 3-4 months to start working again. I battled severe depression and anxiety, not knowing at the time that I had ADHD. The key to my recovery was 50 mg of Pristiq per day, a lot of Ativan, walking daily, therapy, eating healthy, a lot of crying, and a lot of support from family. I did not take any ADHD meds at this time (as I would not be diagnosed until over ten years later).

During my life, I never had any single traumatic events that I can recall. However, I am sure that I experienced “little-t” traumas from being closeted until I was 25, and from not knowing that I was adhd/autistic trying to operate in a world made for people without adhd (I believe the pain caused from bullying I experienced as a child related a lot to my emotional dysregulation and different social skills). 

**From mid-20’s until summer 2024:** After I made it through the depression in my mid-20s, I managed to fully “re-enter” the world. I got a job, and moved up the corporate ladder quite quickly. I finished my PhD and I got married to the absolutely sweetest and kindest man I know. We bought a house, a dog… the whole bit. I experienced real external markers of success: awards, recognition, etc. In retrospect, I believe this all fuelled my need for external validation. During this period, I had slight “bouts” of burnout and depression largely emanating from something work-related (and/or me pushing myself too much). However, I never was so burned out or anxious that I could not work. I always made my way out of these bouts by changing things up such as new jobs or promotions. However, I think during this period, my inner critique of “you are not good enough”, “you must work harder”, etc. slowly started to take deep hold, as I was never satisfied that I was doing enough. I continued in therapy on and off during this period as my anxiety would peak.

**Summer 2024:** In the summer of 2024, I was starting to feel a bit more of an intense burnout, related to professional course I was taking. Despite all my studying and work, I was simply not progressing (which was definitely hard for me to compute, as I often excel at most things I do). I began to suspect I had a learning disability. After seeing a psychologist and completing 6 hours of a psycho-social-educational assessment, I found out that I had ADHD / autism.

Once I titrated up to the therapeutic dose of Vyvanse (50mg), it felt like my life was completely different. My anxiety left me completely, to the point that I could not believe it. I felt like I could finally regulate my emptions, and so much pain and frustration from the past made sense: My brain was always just looking for stimulation; lack of executive functioning made managing emotions difficult; etc.

I passed my course and returned to work with like this new sense of who I was; it felt incredible.

**Early 2025 to Spring 2025:** I started a new job, one which was a huge promotion in terms of title and pay at another organization, where I thought I would have the opportunity to develop teams and make a real positive change in people’s lives. My boss ended up being incredibly horrendous and the workplace was toxic and never felt safe (I will not provide all details for the sake of brevity, but just imagine a completely chaotic, emotionally-raged supervisor destabalizing you every 2-3 hours during a work day). My system collapsed in the spring, and I went on sick leave.

  
**Spring 2025 - Burnout:** Initially when I went on sick leave, I thought it was only going to take me 1-2 months at most to feel better. The burnout I experienced (and am still making my way through) has been unbelievably intense: Initially I was having night tremors, night sweats, sleep walking, vomiting in the middle of the night, panic attacks, unable to concentrate on anything, etc. However, once the burnout symptoms started to lift, it was replaced with constant and intense anxiety and depression. 

Luckily, this has not happened in the past 1.5 months, so I suppose this shows some level of improvement. However, I still struggle daily with a high baseline anxiety, and am constantly getting caught in mental “loops” in my head catastrophizing, and struggling to maintain a routine and manage predictability/boredom (thinking that this is an ADHD thing). My self-confidence is compeltely shattered, and I struggle to know who I even am sometimes. I feel like I could slip back into total emotional and functional collapse at any moment. Boredom and lack of desire to do anything is really a curse for me right now. Nothing feels “good enough” to do, like there is no rewward for me (even though I know that certain activities would normally make me feel rewarded). The rumination and anxiety is so bad at times that I literally am paralyzed, unable to make even small decisions. I can ruminate on something for 2 hours, even after trying to distract (with normally only ativan or A LOT of talking to my parents or husband causing the rumination to stop). I often slip into hopelessness, which then spikes my anxiety even further.

I have 2 months more sick leave left to find a new job in a different organization. I have received some good feedback from hiring managers which appears hopeful. They are both for much lower-paying jobs in junior roles in my field of interest (types of jobs I did ten years ago). While this hurts the ego a bit, I am trying to ignore that and think that these types of jobs are for my health. However, almost daily I will find myself spiraling, anxiety high, and “locked into” my thoughts, and catastrophizing that I will never be able to work, given my current mental health state. Every day is a struggle. I have had some good days, but for the past 2 weeks or so, my brain feels like it is starting to collapse underneath all of the constant rumination and catastrophizing.

**Treatment:** I am seeing a therapist and have a family doctor as well as a pharmacist who provides hour-long consultations to assist with selecting medications. My treatment plan also includes as much rest as possible (I am not good at this, as everytime I try to nap, watch TV, etc. I just want to panic and run), walks in nature, being outside as much as possible, avoiding high stimulating events, etc.

**Medications**

**Vyvanse (discontinued):** During my first 2 weeks of burnout, I continued to take 50mg of Vyvnase. However, I quickly learned that the crash from the Vyvanse was disastrous (causing me to go to the hospital at one point for a visit with the ER psychiatrist). I never experienced an intense crash with Vyvanse, prior to be burning out. When I came off of Vyvnase, I felt a bit better knowing that I would not have to deal with the crash and felt like I could fully “feel” and realize the situation I was in. For a few weeks I was OK off of Vyvanse, keeping myself busy fixing up the house, small projects, gardening, etc. I briefly tried going on a low dose of Vyvanse (20 mg), and also Concerta, but the crash again was too much. My pharmacist/doctor said that it “may” be that the stimulant is too much on my nervous system at the moment.

**Strattera (first dose today):** Following a consultation with the pharmacist at my doctor’s office, she decided to start me on 25mg of Strattera (non-stimulant) for two weeks, and then increase to 40mg. I took my first dose today; I am really hoping that the Strattera helps with my ADHD symptoms (mainly rumination, emotional regulation, and internal satisfaction/reward) which may then reduce my anxiety and reliance on Ativan. I feel like my ADHD symptoms may be keeping me in a “holding pattern” a bit: overthinking, catastrophizing, etc. which activates my nervous system. I am bored to tears but the things that normally would give me a sense of reward seem pointless. I look forward to having the structure of a job in my day, but I am terrified it will be too much for me to handle.  I am hopeful, but EXTREMELY apprehensive whether Strattera will work; I hope it does - I really need hope. However, I am worried that I am just “kidding myself” regarding the positive effect Strattera may have. I know how good I feel when I take a stimulant. I am not expecting Strattera to do that; rather, I am hoping that even just a slight reduction in my ADHD symptoms would reduce my anxiety enough to allow me to think beyond the very present moment, cry when I need to, talk to myself more positively, and heal (and therefore reduce the amount of ativan I need; the fear I have of this drug almost reduces the hope it gives me sometimes).

  
**Ativan:** I know all of the risks of dependency, etc. associated with Ativan. However, right now I am using 1mg to 1.5mg per day, as it is the only thing that let’s me access my feelings, gives my nervous system a rest, cry, read books, walk in nature, etc. with a sense that I am healing. It does concern me that I have been using 1mg to 1.5mg per day for over 1.5 months now, but really it is the only thing that is acting as a “bridge” for me, until I find medications and a life structure that works to reduce my anxiety. The pharmacist does not have any issue with me using it, given my current situation. When I take Ativan, and have had time to reflect, cry and journal, I start to feel a glimmer of “hope” that I will make it out of this storm

**Socializing:**

Prior to burnout, while I was an introvert, I did not have any extreme social anxiety/fear about being in big groups, parties, etc. from time-to-time. In fact, at times I would love hosting parties at my house. Now in burnout, I feel so completely and utterly overwhelmed by the thought of large groups and having to maintain conversations with people who do not know or understand what I am going through. It is summer, so the pressure to socialize is high. I also have this nagging critical thought in my head that “you should be socializing more”. My socialization is mainly: phone calls with my best friend, talking with husband and parents, light socialization at the gym every morning, and I try to go out of my way to strike up a conversation when I am grabbing a drink at a café.

  
**One last point - ChatGPT:**

In addition to my human therapist, I have been using ChatGPT A LOT to help talk back to anxious thoughts I am having, reminding me of my healing journey, etc. It seems to help, but sometimes I feel like I am relying on it too much.

**\~TOPICS / QUESTIONS FOR FEEDBACK\~**

Below are some questions / concerns I have that I was hoping people could chime in on to give me hope (I am already very aware of all the side effects and “what-if” catastrophic scenarios, so I am hoping for stories, ideas or examples from people which can provide me with a bit of hope to hold on to, particularly during the dark or scary times. Examples of how you made it through similar situations would also help).

1. Has anyone been through a similar situation of burnout where they used Strattera to help them get “out of the hole?”

2. Has anyone used Ativan for 3-4 months daily to act as a “bridge” until they were stabilized?

3.  Has anyone had success with treating ADHD with Strattera, particularly when unemployed?

4. Has anyone had success with treating ADHD with Strattera when employed?

5. What are people’s experiences with returning to a different job following a burnout (with ADHD / autism)?

6.  What are people’s experiences with socializing during burnout? Particularly from an ADHD / Autism perspective? I do want to socialize again someday, but right now it feels like too much (and I beat myself up for missing events, even though they feel overwhelming; I am worried I might regret something I suppose). 

7.  I find it difficult to develop a routine at this point as nothing is interesting me. I had more of a routine during the first month or so of burnout, but everything just feels like such a struggle now. I try to have “anchors” and a “middle” in my day (e.g., gym in the morning, light task after that, lunch, therapy or walk in the afternoon, then supper with husband, Ativan, watch TV with husband/read, go to bed). Has anyone struggled with routines during burnout recovery but still managed to get through it?

8. A lot of the advice I get from family/friends (and even therapists) has good intentions: The advice identifies the “problems” I have but never really any concrete solutions. For example, “you need to be more compassionate with yourself” (Me: how?; I am reading the books but my brain is constantly all over the place); “your identity is really wrapped up in your work and productivity” (Me: I have known this for a while, how does one separate their identity from a place they spend 40 hours per week, when their brain at the moment can barely decide on whether to have breakfast before or after the gym?); “You need to ‘talk back’ to the anxious/critical voice in your head” (Me: How?  The critical voice is constant, I literally cannot keep up with it, and when I do talk back, the critical voice responds with something even more critical, creating an ongoing loop). 

Any hope you can provide in this area is much appreciated.

 Many thanks for taking the time to read my post and offer your examples of hope. Super grateful knowing there are others out there. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

 Have a great day.

2025-07-09 00:15:56;Psych hesitant to diagnose. Feel like imposter;"I (37F) have had issues with anxiety and burnout or depression (hard to differentiate) since I was a teenager. I always had good grades but did have trouble paying attention and interrupting class as a child and into university. I’m always fidgeting and wondering what’s next, rather than relax or be in the present moment. I’m also a highly sensitive person to sounds, smells and textures. My main complaint is my mind never stops — it is so busy and I feel exhausted by myself.

So I self-referred to a psych who does ADHD assessments. We did an interview and a cognitive test. He said the results were inconclusive. The cognitive test didn’t have the hallmarks of ADHD (e.g. poor working memory or a big discrepancy in one area of functioning vs another). Many of my issues could also be anxiety because there’s significant overlap. 

The psych decided to make the diagnosis anyways so I could try a medication and let that be the determining factor. If ADHD medications help (alone or in partnership with an anti-anxiety med) then that’s the confirmation. If they don’t, then that’s confirmation to. 

I appreciate that he didn’t entirely dismiss me. I also feel a little disappointed. Not because I want ADHD but because it would explain some things. ";r/adhd_anxiety;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lussra/psych_hesitant_to_diagnose_feel_like_imposter/
2025-07-08 05:03:12;Should I push for an ADHD assessment? Psychiatrist seemed to dismiss it;"Had a psych follow-up recently. I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have OCD traits, but something happened that’s got me thinking, and I could use some perspective.
The psychiatrist asked me if I was hyperactive as a kid. I said yeah — I was really all over the place, got injured a lot from just being nonstop active. But that kind of vanished as I grew older.
He replied with something like: “A lot of psychiatrists confuse ADHD with bipolar — I was just checking.” Then he moved on.
Later I mentioned that my self-esteem is around 3/10, mainly because I struggle with things like hygiene and staying consistent with basic stuff, even when I’m feeling mentally stable. He didn’t explore that either.
Now here’s the thing — before starting fluoxetine 20mg, I was genuinely about to drop out of med school. Couldn’t study, couldn’t focus. After starting it (I’m also on lithium 900mg), everything got way better. It felt like my brain finally turned back on.
But now I’m wondering… what if the meds helped because I had undiagnosed ADHD on top of the bipolar 2, and we just never saw it clearly because my mood improved?
I’m stable now, but I still struggle a lot with executive tasks — planning, hygiene, staying consistent, organizing my day. My psychiatrist didn’t really follow up on any of this.
Should I push for an ADHD assessment? Or get a second opinion? Anyone been in a similar situation? 🤔💭";r/adhd_anxiety;4;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lu5yzt/should_i_push_for_an_adhd_assessment_psychiatrist/
2025-07-07 19:47:48;Tried a friend's ADHD medication, did it have the same effect on me as it does on people with ADHD?;"This is NOT recommended to anyone! Please only take any medication for adhd when you are supervised by a doctor!

So the whole situation was more of a spontaneous thing. The friend that gave it to me had been diagnosed pretty early in life but I didn't get diagnosed yet because of multiple factors (like inattentive type of ADHD and not having my mental health cared for).
I know what neurotypical people use it for and that it has other effects on you if you do not have adhd, well and he knows that too.
So he came up to me and asked me: ""You wanna see if you really have adhd?"". In that moment I really struggled because it could have destroyed my whole identity and what if I didn't have it? I just would have been wrong for so long.
In the end I took it. 
And I didn't feel much different. I kind of felt at peace with myslef but at the same time I felt a bit stupid. Ig Stupid in the way that there wasn't much going on? There were like still songs playing in my head but more crisp. I felt like my head was emptier and when I talked I also heared my voice better. 
Sadly there wasn't anything task like to do besides bringing out the trash I forgot the day before. Atleast I did it even tho it rained and I can't really describe if it felt easier starting it, I just did it ig. 
I feel like I am gaslighting myslef into thinking that it didn't work but I also fear just pretending that it worked. 
The things that were negative are that I got super thirsty (yes usal side effect) and at one point I was a bit nauseous for like 5 mins. 
After about 2 hours the effects were gone and it felt like I was at my normal state again.

So what do you guys think about my expirence with adhd medication? 
Did it do the stuff to me that it would do to a neurotypical person or to a person with adhd?

2025-07-06 11:12:54;can ADHD make it seem like you don't care about your loved ones?;"hello! im very sorry that the title is presumptive and offensive, i dont mean to be, im just not sure how else to word it TT

**TLDR:** this is a personal post about my relationship/history with my mom about her ADHD. i feel guilty that i took symptoms of her ADHD extremely personally as an adolescent. for a long time i felt that she did not care about me at all. i want to know if others have had similar experiences/advice about how i should better approach my mom's ADHD. what is reasonable to take personally, and what's not? how can i better support my mom?

my mom was diagnosed a couple years ago in her mid 50's with severe ADHD, and she also has GAD. My sister also has ADHD, and i was diagnosed 6 months ago at 20 with level 1 autism. I know a bit about ADHD due to some heavy autism research and their overlap, but not as much as I'd like to.

Growing up, I slowly realized that no one wanted to hear me infodump and monologue. While I think this was necessary for me to learn, having your mom never want to listen to you and get bored was very painful for me.

I eventually became sort of a therapist/friend character in her life. It was the only way I could have her listen to me. When my sisters mental health got really bad, so did hers, and there was a period of a few years where we barely spoke to each other. She hardly acknowledged me, would forget important things about my life and myself, and express disinterest and boredom at the things I was saying. She would sidetrack conversations into things she was preoccupied with. And it felt like she was never occupied with me, right in front of her. 

Later we learned that that was a depressive episode. Along with that, her often rather severe anxiety makes it worse. When we could have a conversation, it would be about her or my sisters mental health/problems. My dad was similarly, if not more, disinterested.

I spent a long time considering my feelings for her. I felt ignored and uncared for. I spent countless nights crying my eyes out, feeling deep in my soul that I had uncovered the undeniable truth that she did not love me or care about me.

Our relationship is much better now. She and my sister are doing worlds better. She's more herself than I've ever seen her, and I'm genuinely happy for her. I know it took a lot of effort for her to get here. But i still can't really see her as my mother because of how long that period of feeling unloved was. I KNOW that she loves me, but I guess it hasn't really hit my heart yet.

I am better at reading when she doesn't care about what I'm saying, and I'm much much better at not taking it personally when she stops listening to me and starts doing something else or interrupts me or whatever. I know that she's gotten a lot of shit for my dad for her undiagnosed neurodivergence. she was made to feel stupid, ditzy, unorganized, and as my dad puts it, ""sloppy"". i never want to make her feel like that, ever.

so i guess my question is, how can i tell the difference between what's her not caring, and what's the ADHD pulling her brain in a thousand directions? it's hard not to take it personally, but ever since her diagnosis its really put my whole life with her into perspective and i feel guilty that i took it all so personally, so intensely, for so so long. my autistic brain wants to put her into a category, an uncaring mom or a caring mom, a bad mom or a good mom, but i know logically that there is rarely such a clean cut case.";r/adhd_anxiety;17;11;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lsradx/can_adhd_make_it_seem_like_you_dont_care_about/
2025-07-05 03:48:03;Medication never seem to work long term? Any better option?;"Hi there cool ppl:) 

30 year young brain here, been diagnosed and on/off meds the last 3 years. Usually in the start the effects are great, but after a while, I turn into a lonely empty shell of a human being. 

Im looking for better alternatives and wonder if anyone can relate and have any tips.

More details if you wanna read: 

I decided to take up Vyvanse again 3 months ago. This time i did 20mg at breakfast + 15mg at lunch (and no meds at Sundays). I felt great the first month, like I could handle life little a bit better. 

Gradually the effects got worse + my sleep got worse. After 2 months, I got into bad habits again, I couldn't feel love for my girlfriend and started being rude to her without me even knowing it. I lost touch with my creativity, lost my spiritual side and every night when the meds wore off I felt this intense dark energy like I was on some satanic suicidal shit, totally hopeless. Then in the morning I take the meds to feel OK, then the cycle continues. If i skip meds a day I get very tiered and its hard to talk and I get autism traits.

Now im tapering down slowly (at 20mg now). My goal is to only use it when I really need it. Ive tried Ritalin, L-tyrosine and Dextroamphetamine and these where even worse. 

I am a super sensitive creative individual, and my psychiatrist told me I have ADD but the total score of symptoms is way less than the average person with the diagnosis. So I guess everyone is diffrent. I still struggle with focus and to juggle between making money, making art, having good relationships and taking care of myself. I had some good effects with microdosing magic mushrooms before, but Ive heard its not a ""valid ADHD treatment"", plus its illegal and that makes me anxious. 

Just wondering if anyone is in the same boat and have any tips. Im constantly thinking about tweaking my brain chemistry to function well. Im sure there is a more simple way to go about it and Im more than happy to hear if anyone has found something that works for them. 

Much love

That was around a year ago, and it's been one of the hardest years of my life, largely because of the new job, which I thought would be my dream job, but it turns out it's a nightmare for my ADHD self. 

As a result of the job and the diagnosis, I've tried a number of of medications and treatments, but including basically all of the stimulants, and recently Wellbutrin, which I only lasted two days on. 

I really haven't liked any meds. 

Part of me appreciates the positives of the diagnosis - the ""reasons"" for many things line up now, but I also often wonder if I actually handled things better before. The ADHD symptoms were always there, and I had ways of coping, but I would mostly hold myself to ""normal"" expectations in one way or another.

Because of all of this I am on medication of course. I'm on CymbaIta (Duloxetine ) for anxiety, wellbutrin for some slight depressive issues and then propranolol for physical anxiety symptoms. I've been on all three for over a year. My neurologist recently changed me to rizatriptan for a migraine abortive and my psychiatrist started me on Vyvanse which I began Saturday. Bottom line I hate taking so many meds and I'm freaking out. I am very worried I'm going to get seraronin syndrome if I try the new triptan or from the Vyvanse. I've been super anxious and don't know if it is something like seraronin syndrome, or just the Vyvanse or me working myself up.

2025-07-01 22:08:36;Can ADHD affect social skills / social anxiety over time? Similar Experiences / Needed Advice;"Hey everyone,

I'm a 19-year-old male, diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago. Growing up, I was always either reserved and shy or on the more eccentric side so people usually saw me as either quiet or just kind of “weird.” Despite this, I managed socially pretty well. I had friends throughout primary and high school and still maintain some of those relationships today. From the outside, I’ve always seemed “normal.”

But in the past few years, socialising has started to feel more and more difficult. I’ve developed a noticeable and drastic increase in social anxiety, and while some of this made more sense after my ADHD diagnosis, things have become such a struggle that I’ve started to wonder whether I might also be autistic which is something I never considered seriously until now.

I've listed out my social struggles here:

* Difficulty initiating conversation (even if I already know the person e.g. coworker) 
* Avoiding social environments leading to isolation 
* Difficulty maintaining already established relationships (lost many friendships) 
   * Difficulty checking up on people 
   * Habit of flaking 
   * Difficulty texting people and maintaining conversation over text 
   * Avoiding 1 on 1 conversations and overly anxious in 1 on 1 social situations (always needing to be in a group or group chat) (unsure why) 
* Either too passive socially (can be perceived as very shy) or overly expressive and chatty 
* Excessive Rejection Sensitivity 
* Constant agonizing about “social performance” after social interaction with someone and worry about weather I annoyed / weirded out / angered them 
* Difficulty with “small talk” and carrying conversation as well as anxious feeling of needing to always keep conversation moving 
* Either anxious about silence or overly withdrawn 
* Not always finding humor about what others find funny in conversation (come off as annoyed) 
* Forgetting names
* Unless I have a long standing connection with a person most social interaction feels forced and uncomfortable
* Strong dislike and finding discomfort with eye contact (end up scanning everywhere but their eyes
* Difficulty greeting people I see / engage with (feels awkward and uncomfortable) 
* General social awkwardness
* Difficulty projecting voice and anxiety about how I sound 
* Zoning out during conversation and appearing disinterested which lead to over correction (ends up making conversation feel like a chore which loops back to me avoiding it entirely) 

So I'm making this post to ask if anyone else has the same experience as me and whether or ADHD can affect you socially and cause the effects that I listed out or if its a different cause. I am currently unmediated (I take a couple vyvanse a week but that it; I will be going to my psych soon), so I wanted to know how I can deal with / manage / overcome these symptoms other than taking medication.";r/adhd_anxiety;9;1;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lp2mqg/can_adhd_affect_social_skills_social_anxiety_over/

2025-07-01 01:52:00;Vyvanse thoughts…;Started Vyvanse 30mg a few days ago. The effects were quick and more and more I feel better. My head is so clear. I have had anxiety for a long time and took lexapro awhile then Wellbutrin. Lexapro had too many side effects and was not good for my relationship and Wellbutrin was nightmare fuel. Wild vivid dreams and panic attacks. I’m trying not to placebo myself because I genuinely feel better and I’ve wanted to try this awhile. I had difficulty getting diagnosed… I think I spooked my dr with my family history and he got the impression I was med seeking. My mom was a meth addict but I think she was also self medicating albeit poorly with meth for undiagnosed adhd aswell. My daughter has it and it’s genetic so it made sense. He made me see a few psychiatrist and one came to a conclusion that I had cyclothymia which is like short term bpd. I never felt that was right and anytime after it was let’s try this antidepressant or that one. Changed docs and this dr wanted to confirm and tried the Wellbutrin 150mg. I felt nothing so he upped to 300mg and it was bad from the start. Stopped and here we are now. I’m curious if my untreated adhd was causing my anxiety because along with feeling clearer I feel so much less anxious. Regardless I feel right and that’s really good. Even had a really stressful moment this morning easily brushed off.

I'm sorry for the long post but please help me out! I need some help and any suggestions/opinions. 
Side note: I also have PMDD

I (38f) was diagnosed at 24. The first med I was on was Adderall and it worked great. I took it for at least a year, that I can remember, and life happened and I went unmedicated from roughly 26 until this past January. Went back on Adderall and I've climbed the ladder all the way up to 30mg IR twice a day. ive been able to rule out menstrual cycle (I track it), I'm staying hydrated, eating lots of protein, and staying away from Vitamin C within an hour before and after taking it. I even know that it's not a bunk generic because my friend picked hers up the day after me and she said that they're fine. 

I don't know where to go from here. I've taken methylphenidate before but it gave me more side effects than benefits. Should I ask about Vyvanse maybe? I can ask the Google (and I will) but I want opinions from real people. ";r/ADHDers;2;6;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1lnvsuo/need_advice_med_struggles/

2025-06-29 05:54:45;How to not struggle in the lab;"Hello everyone!

I was recently diagnosed with adhd, and in my testing, it was found out my working memory is low, even if other types of memory are above average.

This semester I've taken 3 lab heavy classes. I've been struggling a lot. Lab time is limited, so I have to get everything done before a certain time, which means I have to work fast. I learn the technique the same day as my lab, so I have no practice. While I'm doing the lab, I have my lab partner talking fast giving me instructions while I'm trying to focus on what I'm doing and the steps. I mess up often.

Recently, the tas have noticed I struggle and have started surrounding me when I am doing anything, to supervise I don't mess up and give me advice. One of them has good intentions and is kind, my only problem is my lab partner starts chiding me as the ta gives me advice so I get overwhelmed by the fast paced conversation going on while I work.

The other TA is a different story. She is very harsh, crowds me, and just starts telling me how wrong everything I'm doing is and even yells. It seems I frustrate her.

I have noticed that when I'm doing unsupervised labs, I perform extremely better. I have time to think about the steps, no one crowding me. The problem is, it is unrealistic to think I could always have that.

I want to get better, since I may want a career in research. Does anyone have any tips? 

Thanks a lot!

Tldr: I struggle with low working memory, so working in the lab has been hard and I want to get better. Any tips?";r/ADHDers;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1lmyg20/how_to_not_struggle_in_the_lab/

I’m newly diagnosed with adhd and I told my doctor lexapro wasn’t doing anything for my anxiety and he said my anxiety is most likely coming from adhd which obviously lexapro wouldn’t target. So we started 10mg xr adderall about a month ago and about 3 times out of 10 it will calm my mind down enough for me to relax and I use the word relax lightly. But other than that it’s really just hit or miss and never does anything for my anxiety. TBH I feel like I’m not on any meds. Nothing is touching me and it’s annoying me so bad. 

I want to be able to relax without this constant need to do something productive. Or racing thoughts 24/7. Or feeling so nervous in public that I could turn inside out to hide from being seen.

2025-06-28 23:30:29;Bizarre Panic/manic episodes in 9yo;"My daughter (9) was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety a few years back. I agreed with the diagnosis of ADHD, as the signs were really clear, but I really wasn't seeing the anxiety (outside of normal kid stuff). She is not medicated.
Fast forward to present day...
My daughter has had 3 episodes now inside of a few weeks where she suddenly jumps up and screams as if someone is murdering her, like as if she was stung by a bee. She screams for water and runs/jumps around. She apparently is having nausea and is super afraid of throwing up. She thinks drinking water helps. She claws at her throat, saying she needs to rinse out her mouth, so it seems some bile could be coming up. We try to get her to sit and eat some crackers...twice it was potentially triggered by hunger/low blood sugar maybe? She is TERRIFIED of throwing up. We can't tell if nausea is triggering this panic, or if some anxiety is triggering the nausea and causing this cycle. They seemingly come out of nowhere/calm moments. This last episode (today) it took a really long time for her to calm down. She'd sit down to eat and then suddenly freak out again and guzzle water. She said it comes in waves. 2 out of the 3 times she had some high sugar item with artificial coloring beforehand (no judgement...I don't buy that stuff for her)
I have been diagnosed with GAD since my early twenties, and her father has a phobia of throwing up, too, but he's never mentioned it to her. I can count on one hand how many times she's thrown up in her life...she's just not a thrower-upper.

2025-06-28 16:39:11;Strange experiences I now know are due to my ADHD...;"Hey friends.....recently got diagnosed and it's sent me into a bit of a spin reassessing everything and every weird experience from my past and present. In short, everything is starting to make a whole lot more sense. I thought it'd be fun to write a few posts as I (re)learn about myself and some of the things I've realised aren't me just being quirky or different, there's actually a cause for them lol. List 1/? (I'm sure there will be many more). Can anyone relate to any? Comment with your own behaviours you didn't understand until you did below....

Hating full pockets / putting my keys in a trouser / jacket pockets.

I've always had an unexplained hatred of putting my jangly house keys in my trouser pockets or jacket pocket. Partially because it stresses me because it feels like I'm more likely to lose them (again), partially because I find the feel of them jabbing my side or leg, or the sound of them jangling away with each step incredibly distracting. I never knew why.

Looking down on people for being too 'slow' or 'sensible'. 

Feeling lonely, different and unlikeable is a common scenario in my head. But one thing that always puzzled me about myself is how judgemental I could get towards others for that weirdest of things. 'She walks too slow' or 'that guy needs to hurry up and say what he needs to say' or at school: 'ugh, why does that teacher force us to do the same tasks in the same way over and over and over and over - what a bore' are all thoughts I've had regularly. Overstimulation and urges to move and do something spontaneous are real. 

Needing to 'walk off"" tasks at work. 

I used to have a job in a busy office where I'd have an online or phone interaction then have a lot of notes to write up after. Most of my colleagues would do an hour long phonecall, power through their notes, and get up only once or twice in a whole 8 hour shift to go bathroom or eat. I used to look on in awe. With many interludes to look out the window during desk tasks, after each call or chat I'd do a full circuit round the building - much to the amusement of my managers who id often accidentally scare with my footsteps at nighttime, in the old Victorian building. 

That look of horror when you unmask. 

I have some strong opinions and views. Most of the time, I keep them to myself because you can guarantee at least someone in the room fervently disagrees. Most of the time the main socialising I used to do was at work, so I'd just skirt round things to keep the peace. Some days though, when I'd feel extra excitable I'd let rip and talk loudly and animated about something I'm passionate about. Half of the time, the colleague or friend in question would look at me with bemusement and horror. I'd always find this so confusing! But now I know....the mask of respectability had slipped. 

Always been the 'hippy one' / 'daydreamer' / 'laid back' 

All my life I've been the ditsy, forgetful, chill, relaxed friend. The one who will listen to your woes and give out hugs and zen. The one who will spontaneously come up with funny stories but lose focus even on you if you talk to me for too long. I used to get shouted at by teachers in chemistry and P.E all the time for zoning out or being in my own world. Mindfulness came naturally to me and I went though quite a serious Buddhist phase. I've always loved making up stories in my head about strangers on the street or gazing out of the window at the street below. Ask me to concentrate on what is going on in the room where the window is, remember your birthday or stay focused on what you have to say for long periods, and you've got no chance. 



List one (of many) I'm sure as time goes on lol 

TLDR: I never understood the following til I got diagnosed: not liking my keys in my pockets, feeling frustrated by 'slowness', needing to 'walk off' overstimulating tasks, people being shocked when you unmask, and being the 'daydreamy' one.

2025-06-28 02:51:22;What are your experiances of self loathing caused ADHD and not fitting in? Or how have you definitively moved on?;"Hi fellow ADHD'ers! (25M) AuDHD'er here.  
Do any of you deal with self-hatred or loathing lurched inside of you?  
Or have you dealt with it definitively and moved on?

Background:  
I was only diagnosed last year and so throughout my childhood, teenage years and a fair few of my young adult life, I have been scorned and disciplined into imitating normality from both parents, school and sibling. The ideal for me has been normality, since if I did not act so, I would be hated or ostracise.  
This left me, as you can imagine, very angry and bitter. But I’ve worked on a lot of it and since my diagnoses and my acceptance of it, I no longer feel this way constantly. Though it does come back with a burning vengeance from time to time, I have very good tools to deal with it when it comes.  
I have a broad social network, a stable job and my own apartment. I have many friends and a fair few very deep connections.

In romance:  
However, when anyone has shown romantic interest in me, it has immediately invoked feelings of disgust and anger in me. Disgust at my being and angry at the person for daring to believe me loveable in any way possible. My whole body wants to revolt and throw up merely thinking that an actual human being, a woman, can find me attractive or loveable in any sense of the word.  
I have therefore turned away six people (two were guys though, but I aren’t that kind of guy) throughout my life, who have shown romantic interest in me.  
This is not willingly. It's waves of strong emotions that comes over me and I instinctively avoid anything romantic or flirting with the person who have shown interest and they usually stop after a month or so.

Thanks for any sharing of experiances and I hope the best for you! :)";r/adhd_anxiety;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lm1v70/what_are_your_experiances_of_self_loathing_caused/
2025-06-26 04:21:14;Do ADHD meds usually do this?;"Hey. I (F20) was recently assessed for ADHD and was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse. I do not know how thorough ADHD assessments usually are, but this was completed in one session and did not contain much evidence from my childhood (little memory of it, no reliable person to ask about childhood). 

The cost of being assessed was very expensive, and a friend offered to let me try her medication to see if it was worth getting tested. Ultimately I decided to get assessed before trialing the medication as I wanted to be safe about it. I did keep this medication though, which was 5mg of short release dexamphetamine (unsure of generic name).

At 12pm I took my prescribed 30mg. I decided that today I would organise my bedroom, including the drawers that I have put off for years.   A task such as this would generally involve 80% staring at walls, daydreaming, overthinking, decision paralysis, and fidgetting. These things may seem like ADHD is a clear issue, however I have other mental disorders that could contribute to these things. I will not go into my symptoms in this post as it will be far too long and is not the purpose of my post anyways.

I was having no trouble getting started with my organising as my first task was fairly simple (organise 1 drawer, already knew what i wanted to toss out) and I was excited to see how tedious tasks feel when I am medicated. Next, I photographed clothes I no longer wanted (already sorted a different day). These tasks felt fine but I dont believe the medication had properly kicked in at this point, so this tells me I was having a good day unrelated to my meds. A good day for me generally involves more productivity, very talkative, very energetic. This made it difficult to judge what was the medication, and what is just my everchanging moods.

At around 2, I felt the same. I understand that there is generally no actual ""feeling"" to when this sort of medication kicks in but I felt like it wasnt doing what I expected. I considered that maybe my expectations were too high. I decided to wait another half hour. At this point, I realised that it had began working as I felt far more motivated to do things that would otherwise have me in a slump. For example, getting a stubborn item out from under my bed would generally have me give up a few times, zone out, and fidget (usually nail biting, skin picking, etc). Instead, I stayed on task, leaving to get a glass of water and speak to my roommate, and then coming back to the task. I asked my roommate some questions about my demeanour, and she came to the conclusion that I seemed a bit more talkative than usual. This I did observe in myself at this point, but not to an unsual extent/something I wouldnt do. She also said I seemed more fidgetty, though I do not agree with this. I was however using hand gestures in conversation and I am unsure if they were more than usual. I noticed a significantly lower amount of fidgetting and recognised that I had not bitten my nails at all, even now writing this which is generally impossible for me.

This is where my story starts to include some not-so-smart decisions. I understand and acknowledge this, and with that I will proceed. At 5pm I became concerned with how much organising I had left to do. But I felt so productive! And I wasn't zoning out, panicking, doomscrolling. I was doing exactly what I set out to do with far more motivation than usual. I could sit down for a break...and just will myself to get up and continue my task. My usual trivial anxieties didnt cross my mind, and if they did they barely brushed the surface. Before this diagnosis, I had spent years researching ADHD. I wanted to get it right, its expensive and I also did not want to put myself in the path of drug addiction. I noticed that when walking back into the room I would immediately have the desire to put music on while I organise. I paused the music and realised that things seem so quiet that it's almost uncomfortable. Or is this a placebo of thinking I have ADHD? Well, then the thought came to me that maybe I want the music because I am seeking stimulation. When I am not on medication I often forget theres no music playing, or get so deep in my own thoughts that it doesnt matter to me. So- If Im seeking stimulation where I dont usually...could that mean I was misdiagnosed? The assessment did not feel very thorough, and it seems like most people my age could get diagnosed due to devices causing low attention spans and such, as well as other mental health issues being so common nowadays. I called my partner and they commented that I seem to be more talkative (I was once again talking about the medication, how it should effect myself vs someone without adhd, my worries about it, etc). Well, I don't want to take this medication If i don't have ADHD, so I felt I needed to test it. Stupid, I know. 

I understand that those without ADHD will feel better focused and motivated on lower dosages of stimulants. I also understand that those with ADHD may feel ""speedy"" effects if taking a dose that is too high for their needs. This test was not as black and white as I hoped.

From my research I have found that many people take long acting Vyvanse in the morning, and then use short Dexamphetamine as a booster later that day if needed. And so...I messaged my friend, asked him what he takes...and at 5pm I took 10mg. I knew that this would likely stop me sleeping, but I did not care. It felt important for me to do this. I felt as though if I maintained focus on the booster of the medication, it would somehow prove my diagnosis was correct. 

At around 6pm I wanted to ask my roommate about her observations of me on my medication. She was watching a tv show and I felt irritated that I could not have a straight conversation and could only talk during advertisements. I felt very talkative during these conversations, but Im unsure if that is simply the topic of conversation. I felt annoyed when the topic changed from ADHD. Was I more talkative because I wanted answers, or could I have been misdiagnosed? Hm.

Went back to organising my room. It's a big job! And at 7:30 I took 5mg. I believe at this point I escaped my ""productive dosage"" and began to feel the ""speedy"" effects. At this point this only really presented as even more talkativeness. Not to a point that is wildly unusual to me, but still far more energetic about topics than I usually am at that time. I did not notice this energy and talkativeness until after I decided to take another 5mg at 9:30pm. I was convinced that if I have ADHD then I would just stay focused when I took more. This was my test, as silly as it may be. I had already accepted that I would be awake all night and set out to clean my room.

Anddd then it kicked in. When I was 15, I took 70mg of Concerta with recreational intentions. I had very speedy effects. If I was in public my mannerisms may have been enough for somebody to assume I was on hard drugs, not to mention my inability to finish a sentence and the very intense need to talk. So when this kicked in, I realised I had fucked up. I did not feel any other speedy side effect except for the fact that I NEEDED to talk. And at this point I knew my clearheaded state was gone. My brain was not overly active or filled with thoughts, I just craved conversation very intensely. But not music. The idea of audio felt irritating. So I spoke to any friend who was awake, until hours went by and there was nobody but myself and my messy room. And so I played a video of my partner on repeat so I could feel as though I was being body doubled. Promised myself some weed and reddit yapping afterwards. And eventually, I succeeded. Despite the slight speediness, organising still seemed far easier than it would without any medication.

My question of course is not ""Do I have ADHD?"". I know this is not a simple answer. If it was, I wouldnt of made such silly decisions.

 I expect to hear comment such as ""you took far more than your prescribed dose in a short amount of time, of course you feel this way"". If this is the case, is it possible that my 30mg dosage is just what I need? But if this dosage helps people without ADHD too...how do I know the truth???

It is now 6am, the day after taking the initial medication at 12pm. I have used a sleep aid and it seems that sleep may visit soon. I hope.

My questions are as follows:

Is there an dosage so low that if somebody reacts ""speedy"" on it, its clear they must not have ADHD?

Is there a dosage so high that if somebody does not react ""speedy"" on it, it is clear that they do have ADHD?

Can I become more talkative on ADHD medication and still have ADHD? I was told I was talkative from my initial prescribed dose. 

Is there any way in Australia to get reassessed at a lower cost? 

I am terrified of developing an addiction to a drug that I was wrongly prescribed. The clearheaded, motivating effects on the Vyvanse alone felt refreshing and my overall mood was stabilised. Being due for my period in a day, I am generally incredibly emotional. Today I felt far more regulated than I usually would. But I was talkative! And the extras made me speedy. Any advice would be very appreciated.

My partner went to pick my meds up on Friday and I also spoke to the pharmacist on the phone because she kept seeing just a note saying 'referred by specialist' with no extra info so she decided to actually look into it and thats when she discovered my drs have been giving me slow realise instead of imediate which are the ones ive found the work for me, the pharmacist is in the process of chasing them up to make sure they sort this asap for me but they can't tell her why or ho this happened. There's a letter of my file stating the exact medication In my treatment which I also have.

Is this common? Is this okay? I'm annoyed because ive been really struggling & has caused me not to be doing great at work and has also affected my mental health.

But honestly, I’m a little scared, so I don’t want to go and be made fun of or not taken seriously. I live in a southern area, and I kind of have always seen this scenario where someone goes to the doctor for possible ADHD, and the doctor just waves them off or doesn’t take it seriously. And I may not even have it, but there are things in my life that make it so much harder. I struggle to stay focused on things, especially chores. It’s not that I don’t want to do them; it’s just that I keep picking so many things up that I never get anything done. I have an awful memory; my wife could tell me something, and I’ll be listening, and just a few minutes later, I couldn’t tell you when she said it. I don’t have a whole lot of passion for anything anymore. And the only reason I suspect that I could have ADHD is that I have some siblings that have autism and ADHD. And I genuinely don’t know if that’s something that can be genetic or not. So what did y’all do when y’all wanted to talk to your doctors about ADHD?

(Also I’m not asking for medical advice I’m just mostly asking about how y’all went about seeking do to the way some doctors handle as far as sometimes not taking younger adults serious about their concerns)";r/ADHDers;2;4;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1lhtwh3/how_to_go_about_getting_a_diagnosis_for_adhd/
2025-06-22 19:22:11;Marriage Falling Apart;"Hi everyone,

I’ve lived with my husband for 5 years and we’ve been together for 8. We got married in October last year. 

A few months ago, he experienced a traumatic experience at work, which led him to the realization that he didn’t like our relationship (my constant “critiques”). We didn’t learn that he had ADHD until about 1-2 months ago, so after the traumatic experience. My husband understands he has this new diagnosis, but also isn’t questioning if this played a role in our relationship dynamic - instead he continues to put the blame on me.

Throughout our relationship before marriage, I often assumed he was lazy, didn’t care to contribute, was irresponsable, and I could never understand why it was so hard to communicate with him. I still accepted our challenges and married him and loved him fully. I do take full accountability for my previous reactions. Since the traumatic experience, I have been working on myself to rebuild our marriage and change my habits and way of thinking to help our marriage. My husband on the other hand is “coasting” and has lost “emotional connection” with me, but is hoping that through therapy (which he goes to 1-2 x a month) and meds (which he starts this upcoming week) will help his brain wake up and make our marriage “a priority”. 

I am conflicted with what to do. He literally is saying our current relationship isn’t the issue and he sees all the efforts I am making and it “is not swaying him”. He says I deserve better and he knows that. He blames himself for my heartache and stress and he says he has this wall up and has this inability to let go of the past, despite never communicating with me how he felt before his traumatic experience since he was masking. 

At one point after this traumatic experience we said we would divorce and we ended up seperating for a bit. He still says that when he considers divorce with me, he feels nothing and is concerned because we were together for 8 years. His therapist is also concerned about this. He continues to say he cares for me and loves me.

I guess my question is: Will the meds actually help him alleviate his emotional dissociation? I am severely depressed from this entire experience and just want to end this on-going unresolved stress. I want my marriage back. I’m in my young 30s and want to live my life, start a family, and be happy, even if my husband has a new diagnosis, I want to be by his side supporting him, but he keeps saying he just wants to do him and doesn’t know if the relationship will work atm since he is struggling emotionally in his life. I know there is no magical pill that exists, but our doctor says for some it can be night and day. 

Any advice would be amazing thank you!";r/ADHDers;7;21;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1lhlkpy/marriage_falling_apart/
2025-06-22 02:27:05;Is ADHD really this common?;"Hi,

I am writing this because I am legitimately curious. Not because I want to doubt the validity of anyone's diagnosis.

I did not get diagnosed with ADHD until I was in my early 20's. I am almost 30 now :(

Growing up, I always remember everything being really hard for me--schoolwork, socializing, dating, working etc.

My question is, where did all of these ADHD people come from? It didn't seem like there were as many people struggling to stay afloat like I was, so I am having a hard time understanding why it's seems so ""common"" now? Were they just hiding it really well? Was I not paying attention?

I have been suggested to have diagnostic testing done for ADHD as 2 seperate therapists and my psychiatrist believe i have it, so I have the full on 3 session testing thing scheduled in October. 

Im making this post because im sure they will suggest medication. For those who struggle(d) with anxiety, bouts of depression, ect., how does being medicated work for you? Im looking for any and all responses. Positive and negative. Im not here to seek out answers for my self, just genuinely curious as to some of yalls experiences. 

Im very much interested in those who are also medicated for their anxiety disorders, or were in the past, and how the combination of medications might have worked for you!

2025-06-18 23:34:47;How did getting tested/diagnosed help you?;"I apologise in advance incase of my assumptions or anything generalises or offends.

I am 24m. I would say for about 10-11 years, pretty much as soon as learning became more intensive, I have always really struggled with my attention. Cue ADHD thoughts.

I have always been a relatively high achiever however, although always from family, friends and teachers they mention how I could still acheive more if I applied myself. Since I was getting by at least always I guess I didn't see the need too much to invest time and energy into the thought. But here I am a week away from my final exams of my masters and I am cannot study for longer then 5 minutes without taking a break.

I know that discipline is important, and I know that you have to train yourself to be able to study effectively. I know that there is growing debate of whether ADHD should be treated as a ""disorder"", as there is no consensus in diagnosing it and no common biological feature between patients. These things also until now have made me doubt if I should entertain it, buckle up and work harder I said.

So, now I'm wondering what you're guys's experience was with it? Did it help getting diagnosed? If even mentally, or from treatment? I dunno, maybe the knowledge or label of, yes I do struggle with discipline, would help me dedicate more time to my work and studies as I'd be aware I need it.

Howdy yall!

Im a 26 year old guy, just recently diagnosed with ADHD combined, due to some previous anxiety issues my psych prescribed methylphenidate 5mg to feel it out. Today i started this project and im sorta confused. I hear that small doses seem to ""relax"" most people, but even with this very light dose i feel pretty energized and floaty, my heart also seems to make some interesting jumps when it starts working but this evens out after 25 or so minutes. My thoughts seem to be less messy or non-existent but at the same time it sorta feels harder to think if that makes sense. Next to this i also experience a interesting ""headrush"" when the medication starts working, like a sort of shiver that runs up my spine and expands over my skull.

Ofcourse im aware every person is different but i was wondering if more people recognize this? Did the feeling change or was the medication changed? 

Because of this i sorta feel confused and maybe question if i actually have ADHD or if theres something else going on.

2025-06-14 14:50:37;OCD and ADHD. obsessive constant urge to redose my vyvanse;"I am really hoping someone has some information, relatable story, or advice for my current situation that has been a battle for years now.I am diagnosed with severe ADHD,  Anxiety and OCD. I am prescribed Vyvanse 40mg and Lexapro 20mg. (Normal vyvanse dose is 60mg but have been trying different doses because of the awful feeling that my ocd is causing)

I am currently really struggling because I can not function without my ADHD medication, however my OCD makes it almost impossible to take it as prescribed. I am constantly obsessing over it wearing off and feel extreme anxiety and distress until I redose. It is a viscous cycle that I would do anything to stop, but in the moment it feels impossible, to the point where it seems easier to just get off the ADHD meds completely, but without them,  I cant function.

I have absolutely no intention of abusing my medication, I am not doing this to feel a certain high or for recreational use. The fact that I am unable to take it normally is honestly such an awful awful feeling and problem I just want to be able to fix. I would do anything to stop, but no matter how badly I want to, the second these obsessive thoughts come into my head, it feels impossible to do anything other than the one thing that will give my mind relief, which is the compusilve behavior, ( in this situation, taking another dose).

Before understanding that this is happening because of my OCD, I truly thought it was happening because the dose wasn't right, or the medication was the wrong one for me and if I just got on the right dose or medication, I would feel balanced enough to take it normal. But since starting ADHD meds again in february, I have already switched medications once, and the dosage 5 times.

So i finally was able to open up to my therapist about it and she explained to me that it is my OCD and nothing is going to stop these thoughts and compulsions besides inner work and therapy to get my OCD under control. I am wondering if anyone has dealt with similar issues and was able to overcome it and take the medication they desperately need, the right way? What did you do to change these thoughts and behaviors, and if it was ERP, does it actually ever get easier?

2025-06-12 19:35:54;Incomplete diagnosis?;"Hi everybody!

For a couple of years now I have been suspecting I might have undiagnosed ADHD. I never really did anything about it, because I lived with my parents, and they don't really ""buy into all that mental health crap"". 

Since I've moved to a bigger city for college, I decided a couple of months ago to get myself checked out with my university's health services. I knew from the start it would be hard, because I was pretty much sure that even if I had ADHD, it was probably not the only thing I had (I've always suspected I had anxiety and even possibly depression). Add to that the fact that I'm a quite high functioning person in general, and have been classified as gifted my whole life (I breezed past every school year with near perfect grades without ever touching a single school book until grade 10, plus I entered the hardest engineering college in Portugal, and nearly entered the hardest major too), and it becomes obvious that things would become a little complicated.

Today I received the results for the tests I performed, and they showed that in every test, my baseline executive function is extremely high, but once you introduce distractions and interruptions, it falls quite dramatically. It also showed that I tend to do things extremely quickly, but let the quality of those things slip significantly. These are things I already knew about myself, so they don't surprise me. 

The psychologist said that the trends in these results tend to show that the problems I have are more related to potential anxiety, for example in how quickly I want to get things done, prioritising speed over quality, my overly negative view of myself, etc...

The thing is, I don't disagree with this. It makes perfect sense that I probably have anxiety, and that that has made everything harder and worse. 

The problem is that it doesn't fit everything. I often find myself having attentive issues even while I'm relaxed and doing something I enjoy. My innatentiveness is often caused by overwhelming thoughts, yes, but not always. Not to mention that my anxiety seems to have only developed in my late teens, whereas I've shown signs of potential ADHD since almost pre-school, with a difficulty in completing boring tasks, a delayed development of speech, my extreme lack of willingness to study, my slight mispellings and misreadings here and there, my very present (even to this day sometimes) difficulty understanding social clues, my absolute impulsivity, talking above other people or interrupting the teachers mid-class, etc...

To summarize, my question to all of you is: is it possible that I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and not ADHD even tho I have both? Is this a relatively common occurrence? If so, what should I do? And is the fact that my baseline executive function scores are extremely high enough to dismiss ADHD entirely?

P. S. To clarify, I'm not at all trying to discredit the psychologist. They were very helpful and professional, and anxiety is in fact something I've thought for a while I might have, and it does help explain a lot of things that ADHD alone wouldn't (like somatic symptoms for example). All I'm trying to understand is whether or not it is possible that I have *both* Anxiety and ADHD, but that the ADHD might have been masked by the Anxiety and my high functioning brain.";r/adhd_anxiety;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1l9k6w5/incomplete_diagnosis/
2025-06-11 04:44:13;Have you seen the show The Rehearsal?;"I just finished it, and it really made me reflect on how having ADHD—or any kind of neurodivergence—isn’t a burden. It’s something that requires feedback, support, and being surrounded by people who understand how you function.

It reminded me that thriving often isn’t just about having a diagnosis or taking medication. It’s also about knowing your own needs, and how important communication is—especially for people like us, who might struggle with expressing emotions, opening up, or navigating social interactions.

Sometimes it’s not about “fixing” ourselves but about creating spaces where we’re seen, heard, and understood. I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences around this.

Also, the main character (Nathan Fielder) seems to be on the autism spectrum, or at least many people relate to him from a neurodivergent perspective. His need to over-prepare and create controlled environments to avoid social discomfort really struck a chord with me.

I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago, and while it was a huge relief to finally put a name to everything I’ve been struggling with, not much has changed since then.

I’m a university student, and honestly, ADHD is seriously messing with my studies. I’m constantly overwhelmed, can’t focus, procrastinate like crazy, and I’m falling behind more than I can admit to anyone in real life. My partner also has ADHD, so we both struggle.

The biggest problem? I can’t afford therapy, coaching, or any professional help right now. So I’m at a point where I know I have to figure this out on my own, at least for now.

If anyone can recommend self-help books that:

* explain ADHD in a relatable and practical way,
* offer real-life strategies (time management, study tips, routines, emotional regulation, etc.),
* and ideally aren’t super clinical or expensive

I would be SO grateful.

English is great (or other languages too, if you’ve got gems to share), and I’ll take anything I can access affordably – libraries, PDFs, cheap e-books, whatever.

2025-06-10 18:39:57;ADHD Medication Confusion!;"Hey everyone, looking for a bit of support — I’ll try to be clear!

I started Titration in March after being diagnosed with high scores for both AD and HD. My life’s generally good but always felt harder than others’. I’m fast-working, ambitious, entrepreneurial, but I burn out quickly, can’t hold hobbies or jobs for long, and often feel low or fed up every other day. I’m tidy on the surface but chaotic underneath — dates, notes, and details slip my mind. Off meds I talk fast and get swept away by music, art, ideas. My mum and brother have ADHD too. I also had surgical trauma in my teens, but EMDR helped.

Starting Elvanse 30mg was emotional — life finally slowed down. I took up bouldering (still going!) and handled redundancy surprisingly well — calmer, rational, organised, seeing friends again. Life felt great for 2 months.

Then on 40mg, fatigue hit. Like my spark, ambition, and enjoyment (even music) faded. Upped to 50mg but BP spiked (156/115) — scary — so I dropped to 40mg. I take it daily at 10–11am but it wears off fast. My drive feels flat. Yesterday I skipped it (had a bug) and felt emotions again, but the old chaos crept back. I'm torn: meds make life manageable but dull; off meds, life is rich but overwhelming.

I would like to find a med that gives me all the perks but makes me happy too. I find that I don't feel happy on the meds. 

I feel lost. Maybe I need weekend breaks from meds or a new prescription (next psych appt in 2 weeks). Stress and job issues haven’t helped. Tried magnesium + L-Theanine but weirdly triggered PMS; I’m on Yasmin also and don't take a break.

Sorry this is long — I just want life to feel easy for once. Off meds I care too much, get lost in depth, distracted. On meds I want to cry as it feels like a relief but the flatness/lack of ambition and happiness is too hard. Maybe this is just adjustment or maybe I need to rethink everything.";r/ADHDers;1;5;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1l7vg8k/adhd_medication_confusion/
2025-06-10 05:42:27;Any tips for school work?;Well hello everyone! I have not been diagnosed with having ADHD, however last week I had a psychiatrist appointment for my anxiety and the doctor really suspects i do. Because my anxiety is so strong we are first seeing how i react to the medication because some of my symtoms may be due to my anxiety. That said i study psychology and many peers have told me over the years i most likely have adhd and maybe some type of autism. I have a hugely important report to finish and my brain is all over the place. I'm super sleepy from the meds and i cant sit down and work for 5 minutes even.

2025-06-10 01:40:41;SSRI’s and Insomnia;"hello, i’m new to this sub. for reference i’m 21F and am newly diagnosed with adhd. i went to the psych for the first time in my life about a year ago and since then I’ve been taking vyvanse + added wellbutrin for my depression a little later on. Neither of these ever affected my sleep. Later, I was also interested in treating my crippling anxiety. i was given lexapro to try first and had to get off it almost a week and a half in because i could not sleep + other side effects. my psych prescribed me Trazodone to help me sleep while weaning off the drug, and it helped me a lot. after this i also tried propranolol and buspirone, neither worked for my anxiety. i stopped trying new meds for awhile until we decided to let me try Prozac. I wasn’t feeling confident because i knew Prozac was an SSRI like Lexapro. I started taking it and just like with Lexapro, around the week and a half mark i started experiencing severe insomnia. Trazodone did nothing for me, even after increasing my dose. I could fall asleep just fine, but would wake up an hour or two later and be awake the entire rest of the night. It was extremely frustrating, greatly interfered with my work and school schedule. I tried to push through and see if it would go away, but I ended up having to get off it for the same reason. My psychiatrist let me try Mirazapine, Seroquil, and Hydroxyzine HCL for the insomnia and none of these helped either. 

Has anyone else also experienced this? I really wanted to keep trying with Prozac but I was getting sent home from work from exhaustion and could not function from the sleep deprivation. This was about two months ago and we haven’t tried any other medications since. I know there are many other popular sleep medications and my psychiatrist didn’t recommend any of them, does anyone know why this might be? I’ve also been told there are no other medications to try to treat my anxiety with.

2025-06-09 20:53:31;Confused: Imposter syndrome or something else?;"

My psychiatrist told me I've just been diagnosed with ADHD which I was surprised about, because the neuropsychologist who oversaw the assessment had told me that my result is most likely going to be inconclusive without any childhood evidence or testimonials from teachers, and my parents are too old to remember anything from that long ago. He told me that, in light of these, for me to test positive for ADHD, I'd have to have done really badly on the assessment.


I have trauma and anxiety so now I'm going through imposter syndrome and/ or doubts about whether my struggles could have been a result of these mental health conditions instead, and whether the results were wrong. I've heard such doubts are common among the newly-diagnosed. I'm further confused because of Dr Russell Barkley's videos about how neuropsych tests are not helpful for diagnosing ADHD.


My assessment consisted of (from what I can remember) 1. Discussing potential childhood and adulthood symptoms, school and work performances, relationships and friendships from childhood to now. 2. The X test 3. Something with shapes, something with numbers I think, vocabulary and words. 


What is the likelihood of misdiagnosis after failing an assessment like this? Could it have been anxiety that’s affecting my life instead? Is #3 the neuropsych test or is it #2 and #3? 


Those that went through this feeling, does the imposter syndrome ever go away? How do you manage it?

2025-06-08 15:42:22;Need advice on medication;"To start off I don't really mean to self diagnose- but recently I've realized a lot of my problems line up scarily well with ADHD symptoms... I do have diagnosed depression, and I've been medicated for that and anxiety before. 

The reasons I'm beginning to suspect it may be ADHD are that I know depression is pretty common along with ADHD and that in the past I have tried stimulant drugs like adderall/vyvanse and I've noticed I don't really feel any sort of high from them, my brain actually kinda shuts up and I can focus on stuff. Thing is I don't know if thats just me not realizing I WAS high from it or not... when I was around people on those drugs they didn't notice me act any more energetic or yk lively. 

Another thing is that caffeine has never done anything for me, if anything it actually helps me sleep sometimes, every now and then I buy a monster after I get off work and when I get home after drinking it I can be dead asleep 30 minutes later even though usually I have very bad issues with getting to sleep.

I really would like to not go on a stimulant prescription if they won't actually help me cause I know they can have issues with withdrawal and addiction and abuse but recently I've been getting more anxious and the ADHD type symptoms have been getting worse or just not changing at all.. Though I would like to just try it out because I mean I don't know what else to do at this point.. this stuffs affecting important parts of my life and therapy and other things haven't really helped. 

And on the topic of trying out ADHD meds, I'm not even sure if my psych would be willing to give me something for it because I told her about an incident I had in the middle of my high school years, which was me ""OD""ing off of xanax... I feel like after telling my psychiatrist that my chances at any effective meds are gone.. I've tried over 10 meds for general/social anxiety and none do anything to help so I'm running out of ideas and in all honesty I at times did turn to other substances to cope. I'm fully aware of the dangers of doing that but like I said its affecting important aspects of life and if I could get properly medicated I don't think I would even have a reason to use other drugs anymore.

For a quick background: I'm officially diagnosed with ADHD, have yet to take any medication. Recently I've been hitting a psychological/emotional breaking point (for multiple reasons I won't get into here). Sometimes, when I'm in this state, I have the sudden and very strong desire to turn into/behave like an animal: Can't talk, only make animal sounds like hissing, growling, purring, etc., move on all fours or hunched over (like dinosaur?) if two legs needed to traverse an area/reach something, biting, scratching, drooling, and other animal like behaviors. When in this state, my mind is usually empty, only reacting to surroundings, unbothered by human thoughts and worries.

I have no idea if this is some sort of adhd thing or a symptom of something else, I just want info on what's happening with me since google has been unhelpful, any insight would be great!";r/adhd_anxiety;4;10;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1l2aad7/urge_to_behave_like_an_animal_when/
2025-06-03 06:56:05;Self Starting, and Other Odds & Ends;"I feel it's always difficult for me to self start, even when I want to do it, this crippling anxiety overtakes me that I can't just 1,2,3, GO! to get it away, it just makes it worse. This bleeds into relationships, I have been robbed by about every person who I ever thought was my friend. I'm autistic diagnosed at 26, with severe PTSD, ADHD, bipolar type 1 (the worse full blown mania one), schizophrenia is on my medical record but I'm not schizophrenic thankfully that was caused by recreational drugs; MDD, GAD, PDD-NOS, hypertension, panic disorder, mild Tourette's syndrome - (facial tics be CRAZY sometimes like I would never want anybody to see me do it), multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, scoliosis, 3 ruptured disks, 1 slipped. I've got these myriad of problems and I haven't begun the process for disability because it feels so difficult to navigate through. I don't have a job because I can't stand up for more than an hour tops without NEEDING to lay down (without kratom I would commit suicide eventually to escape the pain, it's that bad, down to my nerves), jobs at home are kinda difficult as school online would be for someone autistic, ADHD, and I just know I couldn't separate work from home if both were in the same space. I have a terrible resume because I've been jet go from every job I've ever had, and earnest efforts were given and every time customers loved me but managers didn't, didn't matter the genre work. So I've been worked any income whatsoever for a year and a half. I'm always afraid they'll turn me down for disability in the same way I'm afraid to keep going to my back doctor to see how deep this vertebrae problem truly is...I know I've got to do it, but what the fuck hesitates me? I was told to go to the heart doctor at 33 after a seizure last week, and I didn't have any pricked scheduling that. A breeze didn't even think bad thoughts about it. But with getting on disability, I feel like a failure maybe rather than utilizing it as a toolkit in order to create a better life rather than making fun of myself unintentionally for not having the things a 33 year old without crippling mental and Isiah illness should have. It's like I compare to one who has no problems like that and that's not fair to me, but I still do it. I'm finally realizing now with guanfacine added to my treatment plan this month that I have much more control on what I'd like to focus on. The emptier head space rather than hundreds of thousands of thoughts per second flying through hyperspace, like me aura enters a room before I do. My soul is loud and big, I'm not lol but my spirit is. ""we'll make you a generational talent savant with music and a wizard with pharmacology, but we gotta cripple you hard to do it boi"" - the Godhead to Rymo.

With this treatment plan, and not doing external recreational drugs for their recreation like psychedelics and dissociatives and stimulants only the most users of users would even know of let alone how to get. This is the first time in my low I haven't used anything outside of my treatment plan and I include kratom in that because without it's pain management, I would rather not exist anymore after too long. For years I had a treatment plan I never really took seriously and would skip the Effexor and stuff and only take the klonopin and adderall at the time. And like half of my month would be great, the other half would either suck or be better because someone who isn't me parted with some of his recreational bound medication in order to gain the money to place an order for [redacted]. I'd have half a month of my meds then the other half the recreational drugs I can buy and essentially self medicate, only worrying to experiment different types of treatments for the sake of different experiences, so the second half would be filled with a pyrovalerones, dissociatives galore, lysergamide heaven. Now sober since August, haven't had a drink in way longer than that (a former alcoholic who kicked it cold turkey on his own before it killed me or became so problematic I was physically addicted. Still, a pint of Fireball every day just for the feeling that started because I couldn't find any weed one day. Oh alcohol is available, so I did that, became heavy drinker for years, quit on my own (I tried a program for one day and that victim once an addict always an addict mind set is so attaching oneself to something they can get rid of like cancer stop the bad from coming into the body by choice, there is no ""I'm Ryan and I'm an alcoholic. I'm a 32 year recovery addict."" right, you're addicted to thinking you're recovering, so you'll never recover. The man who created the 12 step program only used LSD to break his alcoholism. But he couldn't press that out so he devised a program. Not that one is bad, just, if you have quit something and don't even think about using it anymore, the thought turns you off, then you're not under the spell of alcohol. That's hogwash. If you've been sober a year, you've quit drinking, maybe not forever, but you quit. You aren't still an alcoholic while you drink, that's what tricks people into being 50 years clean and calling it recovery. No my sir you have earned it, you have RECOVERED. That's why I didn't do programs, just abstinence by choice end/rant/explanation). It's overwhelming to have that empty space where I'd think about doing a recreational drug or would rather be doing that, like a strong urge every once in a while that I've got to push away and just stick to my treatment plan. It's even tempting to take another of my meds that can be abused sometimes, thankfully I've got the power of conviction and can abstain. It causes me anxiety though, or I don't even know what the feeling is, it's just emptiness but not in a bad way. It's less cluttered, things are tucked away in my mind, it's like it's room has been cleaned. I don't know what to do with the new feeling, but when I go to do something like get further in a game I'm enjoying, I'll like beat myself up for doing it because I'm not song what most people my age do. It's always comparing, and comparing to those who don't have umpteen hard to believe number of comorbidities probably worsened by a TIA and traumatic brain injuries. Comparison is such the thief of joy. Right now, things are empty, it's life I can live on most folks Saturday or Sundays, no real responsibility and can do what I want sans car or money. You'd be amazed at how you can make mundane things fun when you are unintentionally on kind of a house arrest type of feeling. I love it outside but it's so hard for me to do the mile walk a day I used to do for a decade. I guess in short, I just relate to the new openness that feels strange as heck. In a slightly joyful like what I've been needing way but in a subjectively kind of scary way. Like I need a handler. 
Feels like a jailbird street they her out of prison and have freedom again but in my head. 

I do use cannabis for neuropathic treatment, kratom keeps me alive more so than any medication maybe besides Klonopin, anxiety is the worst thing for me, then focus on things I'm not interested in, then organization like it's hard for me to keep things in order, and when I put things in orderly, it always becomes chaotic. My existence is like the Tasmanian Devil. Always spinning but never getting anywhere. These meds are making me feel 1000% better than the 18 months I had to go cold turkey grill 22 years of 60mg Adderall, 2mg Klonopin, Effexor, Oxcarbazepine, Spravato (Ketamine), Propranolol, Lisinopril. From weekly for years to absolutely nothing without warning. The place had been shut down now, clear why, they almost made me commit suicide. Created the situation for suicidal ideation, but that brought me to my current psychiatrist who is a gem. Knows I'm a pharmacology student of the game and we can talk science of chemicals, I ask him what he thinks about say Memantine for a catch all for everything I've got, asked him to put me in Guanfacine this month because every thing it does seems to benefit what I've got wrong.

Thanks for the time, love all. I want to do something right now, and I feel ABLE to, but like I'm doing something wrong if it's not serious as fuck. Waaay too hard on myself, dude told me that at just three days knowing me in a psych ward that I was in for one week. Dude could tell how hard I am in myself in two days, that's nuts. I don't know how not to be hard on myself. Self improvement is my mantra, Goku loves training, that's what I do but mentally when I write my lyrics or freestyle and improvise. But with that there's always this ""ah ah ah tsk you shouldn't be, say, listening to a podcast and going on a walk, you should be doing what everybody else your age is doing and what you ought to be doing with the deck you were dealt from was damaged before you were even dealt a bad hand kind of luck roll of the dice"", it's brutally unfair to myself and I can't find the right way to enjoy just, playing a game for the enjoyment of it. It's as though now that my head is now clear, I feel if I'm not DOING something then I'm doing no THING therefore the absence of anything, putting me in this vortex void of being caught in a web. Halp? People say just do it anyway and holy shit I wouldn't have problems if I had that ability xD

2025-06-03 05:55:42;Made myself a spreadsheet to stop bouncing between life goals every month;"Wanted to post this to potentially give anyone who wants a tool to help them visualize their long-term goals or habits.

I was diagnosed just last fall with ADHD as a 25 year old adult which opened up a lot of doors for finally understanding how my brain works. The problem I ran into was even though I was able to manage my day-to-day activities or to-do lists, I found myself starting longer habits or projects that eventually fell through or I quit doing to pursue something else.

Eventually I got so overwhelmed with the amount of things I wanted to do in my life that I took the time to make a spreadsheet that would organize “inputs” I gave it into categories that helped me visualize what I actually needed to be focused on and what might just be distractions.

2025-06-03 02:48:15;Multiple Doctors - No Diagnosis;"I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for about 4 months now. I went after my primary care doctor suggested I get checked out for ADHD. 

The one psychiatrist suggested I was “just depressed” when I told them about what I was experiencing and how it is to the point wear it’s impacting my ability to work. I’ve scored “mild” for anxiety and ADHD. But the psychiatrist has insisted it’s most likely anxiety causing me to have similar symptoms to ADHD. 

I know stimulants can worsen ADHD, but I did not originally set out to find meds. I set out to find understanding. I’ve felt the doctors so far have insisted i take anxiety meds(which I have started but my lack of focus/inability to finish tasks/forgetfulness persists). I have had two psychiatrists tell me to take Wellbutrin of Zoloft, but these seem pretty extreme.

It might be worth mentioning that I’ve been out on a 30 day PIP at work. Now I am extremely worried about my livelihood, and the increasing pressure to things perfect only seems to cause me to make more mistakes.

2025-06-02 12:34:32;What do you think about my hypothesis about ADHD?;"I think there is a deep relationship between cerebrospinal fluid, posture, and ADHD, but what do you all think? (I don't think this theory applies to everyone.)

I would like to hear your opinions on my outlandish (ridiculous) hypothesis.

For example, I have been diagnosed with ADHD + CFS, but any drug that increases dopamine only makes me manic, no matter how small the dose, and only SSRIs, SNRIs, and tricyclic antidepressants work for me. (I have never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I never go into a manic state except when I take drugs that increase dopamine.)

In addition to basic executive dysfunction, my symptoms are a constant physical pressure on my brain, stiff neck, easy fatigue, spinal distortion (imaging diagnosis), and degenerative disc disease. (I was surprised to find out that I have degenerated discs even though I'm only 24 years old).

Also, my cortisol level is abnormally low (below 1.0. I was hospitalized and had a test done). Other symptoms include dry eyes and skin, erectile dysfunction, vision problems, and having Marcus Gunn syndrome at birth (now in remission?). I also had obsessive-compulsive disorder at age 10. (My OCD is now in remission.)

All symptoms except ADHD developed after traumatic chronic stress from age 15-17. However, the causal relationship is unclear.

Given this fact, my hypothesis is that ""the problem of my body's distortion causes abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral blood flow, which in turn causes my executive dysfunction by not activating the prefrontal cortex.""

For example, when I take benzo, my executive dysfunction, fatigue, and brain pressure improve all at once. (I have almost no anxiety, and I have not been diagnosed with anxiety. Every time I say this, I am asked, ""Maybe you have some unconscious anxiety?"", but at least I am not aware of it at all.) )

Initially, I thought that benzo's effect on GABA and the balance with glutamate were improving my CFS and executive dysfunction, but now I feel that the muscle relaxant action may be improving neck stiffness and blood flow, and that these changes may be improving my ADHD. (Of course, it is also possible to take a middle-ground view that both mechanisms are involved to a certain extent.)

What I would like to ask you from here is:

① I thought I had CFS, but CFS is a syndrome and may be caused by some kind of disease. (My CFS did not develop post-virally, but after continuous traumatic stress from the age of 15 to 18. The causal relationship is unknown.

I suspect that it may be Low CSF Pressure Syndrome. However, is it also possible that it is EDS? The ANA test was negative. I have a narrow perspective, so there may be a disease I am unaware of that is the true cause.

② If there are any treatments or medications that seem to be effective for my symptoms other than ADHD, please let me know. I have tried almost all SSRIs, SNRIs, and dopamine reuptake inhibitors. The only ones that have been effective are Nortriptyline and Imipramine. , benzo (a drug that helps with sleep; for some reason Clona has almost no effect), Prozac, and Opipramol.

I have yet to try many drugs that affect cerebrospinal fluid or cerebral blood flow. I have never been treated by osteopathic or chiropractic care.

3. Please let me know if there are any drugs that you think would be effective for my ADHD symptoms.

I believe that there may be rare drugs that have not been tried yet that could work for me. I also feel that drugs that act on glutamate, drugs with completely new mechanisms, and peptides have potential.

Thank you for reading this far. When I post things like this, I am sometimes mocked for being obsessed with my health. I think they are right. However, I spent the years between 17 and 24 bedridden due to fatigue and pressure on my brain, unable to do anything due to ADHD, and living in hell every day.

Finally, some medicines have started to work for me, and I am now able to move around a little. From that experience, I want to research even the smallest information and possibilities in detail and somehow rebuild my life.

This is a long post, but even a partial answer is fine. I would be happy if you could point out some of my foolish assumptions and knowledge.";r/ADHDers;0;5;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1l193ru/what_do_you_think_about_my_hypothesis_about_adhd/

I felt back to life. Eventually I was put on a mood stabilizer for my mood swings as they were pretty brutal and they did good for a while. I’ve bounced back and forth between “do I have depression?” For YEARS. I’m talking like 7-8 years. I’ve tried all the medications, but I’ve only tried one ssri since being diagnosed with adhd and when I took it, it made me feel like a zombie, tired all the time, completely numb. I was on 20mg of Prozac and 20mg Vyvanse at the time.

I’m reading that being on too low of a stimulant while taking an ssri can cause it to that, but I’m not sure. Currently, I’m on 40mg Vyvanse and it was working great, but it seems like everytime we increase it when my executive dysfunction gets bad again and my motivation and energy goes away, it just stops working and I need to increase it again. Has this been depression? I don’t want to die, I don’t get sad, I just feel anhedonia. I don’t get happy or feel good about getting tasks done. I don’t wanna do the things I need to because I just don’t care. I don’t have energy, I’m tired all the time, I don’t enjoy going to the gym or going on walks or being active like I used to. It literally feels like I bounce back and forth. I’ll be good for a while and then it feels like my Vyvanse isn’t as effective. It still helps somewhat for my adhd, but I just feel flat.

Both agree I had ADHD and autism. (I already have an autism diagnosis). Psychologist diagnoses me with ADHD. Take this back to my psychiatrist (who asked me to do this).

OMFG.

She says that despite meeitng all the DSM criteria, its just a matter of self-control and that meds will not help with my crippling anxiety or lack of ability to concentrate on important tasks (I need to s\*lf-h\*rm to motivate myself to complete important tasks and she accused me of having no self-control and that I need to ""deal with it""). Doesn't diagnose me and doesn't prescribe medication - she thinks psychologist is lying. So I get very pissed off and ask her why is she accusing me of having no self control when I have these crippling issues. She legit says ""Because you said that your parents had disciplined you when you were a kid and you performed well in school after that point, besides most of us Indians don't need medication or anything to fix, its ok you can do this!""

She legit just admitted that she only provides medication to white kids because they aren't able to self-control like Indians can because we get hit and abused by our toxic parents who don't think ADHD is real.

I have a full blown meltdown and scream at her to give me my psychologist diagnosis back and I go to another Indian psychiatrist for diagnosis (as this was the only one available within the next few weeks, unlike the rest with over a months plus wait). She does the other way this time, like full assessment with one of my parents.

It was horrible when my parent was there. They both were laughing and smirking at each other whenever I made a comment such as ""its very hard to concentrate so I have to force myself, and I think I have executive dysfunction"". They were literally laughing when i said executive dysfunction because apparently NEITHER of them knew what it meant. At the end, she told me the same thing, that despite meeting the criteria of dsm5 for diagnosis, she thinks its a self control issue and I need to just ""handle it"" like I have been handling it. I asked her why, she said because I had very good high school marks (despite historically low performances during primary school and me explaining that studying had become a special interest of mine to cope with social isolation and anxiety and that despite that, I needed to s\*fl h\*rm to motivate myself to study my college entrance tests).

Both these psychiatrists have invalidated my experiences and my struggles, all because I am Indian and ""indian kids don't deal with these things"".

2025-05-28 20:12:25;😵 One Week on Ritalin 5mg (3x/day) After 2 Years of “Anxiety” Diagnosis… What Is Even Happening to Me?;"Hey all — I’m 32M and just diagnosed with combined-type ADHD after 2 years of therapy, SSRIs, and being told it was “just anxiety” or “depression"" or ""panic attacks"" with little to no effect.

Now I’m on Ritalin 5mg every 4 hours for the last 7 days (3x/day) and honestly… it’s been a ride.

Here’s my daily cycle:

~30–45 mins in: I feel a slight rush — a bit overstimulated, tight chest, mild nausea, jaw tension. This creates a bit of panic in me admittedly.

~1.5 hrs in: I hit a calm groove I’ve never felt before but it feels a little off (kinda fake) — but like real quiet. I start yawning a lot and feel a little spaced out.

~3 hrs in: I feel sleepy and then back to baseline (I guess?)


I keep asking myself: Do I actually have ADHD or am I still just anxious like they always said?

👉 Is this kind of cycle normal in the first week?
👉 Did any of you go through this mental/emotional confusion too?

On one hand, I'm convinced I have adhd because the meds calm me down a little and reduce the noise, on the other I feel overstimulated when they kick in even if its just 5mg...

Would love to hear from people who’ve been here. It’s exciting and terrifying at once. 🙏 P.S.

2025-05-28 19:11:18;I've always struggled to cook but I've found a way to cook consistently;"I recently hit rock bottom, and it pushed me to rethink my life—operating on the assumption that I might have ADHD. This isn’t a diagnosis I picked up from a casual Google search; rather, several people close to me have noticed and mentioned that many of my habits line up with ADHD traits.

After extensive research, I decided to try a dopamine detox to reset my baseline dopamine levels. At the same time, I used this reset as a springboard to build new habits in three key areas: sleep, diet, and physical activity.

It’s been 3 weeks, and I’ve kept up habits that once felt impossible: rising early to meditate, making my bed, sticking to both morning and evening skincare routines, working out, and more.

One habit that I’m working on is cooking. Until just a few years ago, I’d never prepared a meal at all, and the thought of planning, grocery shopping—let alone putting it all together in the kitchen—has always filled me with dread because I don’t even know where to begin.

I started using Artificial Intelligence (you can guess which app) and cooking is starting to be painless. I’ll type something like, “I have chicken breast and some spices—what can I cook?” and it spits out a handful of healthy, fool-proof recipes. Every Friday, I ask for a week’s worth of simple meals, choose my favorites, and it rolls everything into one concise grocery list. Shopping suddenly feels manageable instead of overwhelming.

He was willing to trial ritalin, and I have been responding very well to it. 

To get to the point, my half sister who came into my life in 2023 (quite a long story) is much older than me and a practicing psychiatrist. The other day we were on a hike and multiple times she went on a rant about how so many of her patients are coming in asking for adhd/autism diagnoses, and how she doesn't get it since they're adults and ""not impaired by it."" I do think that we as a society have gravitated towards labels since we are in such an uncertain time (and I did express this as a neutral explanation for what she's noticing), but I don't like how dismissive she was, especially about her own patients. She also said that when she was a teenager ""if you felt out of place, you just joined a subculture."" It really makes me scared to tell her that I was diagnosed myself as an (semi)adult. I don't really plan on telling her but it makes me feel bad that I feel like I *can't*, and I worry it will somehow slip out or word will get around, as I did tell our SiL.

I was diagnosed with ADHD back in July and have been on 30 - 40mgs Vivance. In my report I was also diagnosed with GAD, however my psychiatrist never touched on it, and I didnt think I had an anxiety issue, so neither did I. 

Things have been great up until 2 months ago, when it was pointed out that I started to pull at my beard a lot. Never thought anything of it until lately, where it has become a very noticeable habit where I have entire patches out of my beard, where even having stubble has me going. 

When I brought this up to my psychiatrist, he seemed rather dismissive, and told me it is a side effect of the vivance and flat out told me ""which of the benefits do you want?"" which seems a tad off-putting

I’m 21 and I seriously think I might have ADHD, but where I live it’s very hard to access a psychologist or get a proper diagnosis. I’d really appreciate your thoughts based on what I’m experiencing:

I make careless mistakes, even as a dentist. Once, I almost gave a patient the wrong solution that could have caused him a lot of pain.

I can’t organize my day or stick to habits, even after reading tons of books and trying many systems.

I often zone out when people talk, and just pretend to listen. Some think I have hearing problems.

In lectures, I rarely absorb anything. One time I even answered a phone call loudly in class without realizing I was in a lecture. It was really embarrassing.

I procrastinate constantly and keep changing goals—for example, I focus on learning programming while ignoring my dentistry studies.

I have a lot of vivid daydreams—sometimes I laugh out loud at them and people think I’m crazy.

My memory is bad—I've almost left the house without a shirt on more than once (shoutout to my mom for stopping me).

I often interrupt in conversations without meaning to. People think I’m rude.

I’m always fidgeting or moving, even while sitting. I keep changing positions in the chair and can’t sit still.


If any of this sounds familiar to you—or if you’ve been diagnosed and relate—I’d really appreciate your feedback. Feel free to ask me anything.

Thanks in advance.

2025-05-25 20:37:07;Natural or over the counter remedies for symptoms?;"I think I have ADHD, I'm 29m and never once was brought to a doctor due to symptoms. Not because of stigma (as far as I know) but I think my parents just didn't notice.

After reading lists of symptoms online and taking online tests (not official diagnosis tests) I'm pretty confident I've struggled with severe ADHD my whole life. I have just about every symptom at some level except for trouble sleeping. I can fall asleep typically in 30 minutes or less when I choose to go to bed. Otherwise, I experience extreme paralysis when it comes to ANY activity, I have trouble focusing in conversations, I hyperfocus on hobbies and niche study interests for anywhere from several days to several months at a time before I all but completely abandon them, and I can't do or focus on anything unless I'm hyperfocused. As a child, the hyperfocusing led to me to completely change my personality and the way I dressed.

Now I know most people will say, ""get diagnosed, it'll make things much easier."" But the reality is I'm not super interested in meds right now. My wife and I very into holistic healing with diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, etc. I realize that stuff may not completely heal ADHD, but I'm curious what people have tried successfully without using medication. I've heard that L-Theanine and L-Tyrosine could both help. I've also heard of lions mane possibly helping. I know people like caffeine but for some reason in the morning it makes me tired and at night it keeps me up so that's not an option. I've heard some say regular exercise and cold showers can help.

Have you tried those things? If so, what was your experience? Anything I'm missing you think I should try?

I am in my late 30s now and usually don't try to think too much about it. I just take whatever makes me such a mess as a never ending uphill battle. I do have a question relating to something that I noticed lately that eats up large chunks of my time and I noticed that I have done this since probably my late teens; excessive list making. I don't mean obsessively planning my day, although I also always have to-do lists that never once get finished, but things like spending hours making lists on which movies to watch, which books to read, adding stuff to my Youtube Watch later list (it's at +2000 videos now) and every time I pick up a new interest I make lists on what to buy too (like which watches to buy (I don't even have the money), which fragrances to try or which DIY projects to do). They always end up being extremely long lists and I do these instead of doing things on my to do lists that are important in reality and I would benefit of.

Now, that I’m starting my 20’s, it seemed to get way worse with my school and work. So, I decided to see what it was and was recently properly diagnosed with ADHD, thus wanted to try the medication for it. I was prescribed a Vyvanse 20mg once a day for a month.

The first day I took in the morning, it was like something in my brain has completely snapped - everything became quiet. So quiet, so peaceful, I don’t remember the last time I felt like that. I guess I felt happy for a moment and then I became disillusioned, is that how a “normal” brain, should work?

I became incredibly calm, which my friend has noticed, as I was texting them. After an hour, I started to feel anxious about everything, like why am I this way and bla bla bla. I could only take Vyvanse for a week, because in the evening for some reason I started feeling annoyed at everyone and everything. I stopped  taking it and my temperature was 37.2 for a few days afterwards.

I was told by family doctor to try it again for 2 weeks and if not, then maybe I should switch medication. Tried it, was even more annoyed, even in the afternoon, lasted about 3 days.

Got prescribed Biphentin (Methylphenidate) 10 mg for a month. Took it for 5 days, but I didn’t get the same feeling as if with Vyvanse. I was only feeling tired and wanted to sleep a lot more than usual. Also, no feeling of wanting to get something done or start doing anything, but also no feeling annoyed. Took Vyvanse on a 6th day, definitely a difference between them.

I would like to hear if you had the similar experience to mine, if so, what has helped you?

It’s really important for me to be on track right now, but I don’t know what to do. Please, share any tips on Vyvanse, Biphetin or ADHD, that you think may be helpful in this situation!

VYVANSE
Pros: Get stuff done, Friendly and more approachable to people - in the morning/afternoon.
Cons: Annoyed at everyone, anxious about everything, can’t listen to my favourite music or tv-show - in the evening/late afternoon.
BIPHENTIN

I’m now 22, and about 4 months ago met with a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD again and sent a treatment plan to my doctor. I explained that I get anxious from overthinking and she said that it was likely that my adhd causes anxiety (I have POTS as well) They started me on Strattera which did not work at all - then we went to Vyvanse which kind of worked, but not all day. Because of that we moved to Concerta which I have been on for 2.5 months. I take 36 mg in the am and 10 mg Ritalin in the afternoon. It works, but not super well. I think that the Ritalin works kind of in the afternoon, and that the morning dose doesn’t do anything

About 1 month ago, my pharmacy was out of my meds, and I had to wait three days to get them. My boyfriend, who is on Adderall, offered for me to take one of his 2 of the 3 days as I couldn’t focus at all with my job, to the point of sobbing because I was so overwhelmed. When I took the Adderall it was like all of the issues I have with concerta were gone. I wasn’t tweaky, but was able to focus on my tasks, stay on track, and no anxiety at all. I kid you not, but just silence in my head and none of the rambling thoughts to worry about.

Because of this, I again mentioned to my doc that I feel like the afternoon dose helps but the morning doesn’t feel like it does anything, and asked if I had any other options to see if we could make a switch, and she said that since I tolerated the concerta and Ritalin with my anxiety and pots I could either up the dose on concerta or do Ritalin multiple times a day.. we upped the morning dose and still no help..

2025-05-20 17:04:55;What disorders are similar to ADHD?;"I have been diagnosed with ADHD, CFS, and mild OCD, but when I take medication that increases dopamine, even a small amount makes me impulsive and hedonistic, and I can't stop my stereotyped behavior.

However, when I take medication that acts on noradrenaline or tricyclic antidepressants, my ADHD improves. Also, for some reason, when I take medication that increases GABA, my ADHD improves.

(You may be thinking at this point, ``Maybe you have anxiety,'' but I don't usually have much anxiety. Also, I don't get manic at all except when I take medication that acts on dopamine, and I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.)

I developed OCD at the age of 10, and I began to think that I might have PANDAS. Also, at the age of 24, I had a herniated disc, and a stomach scan showed that I had candida.

I suspect that I have some kind of autoimmune disease or a similar disease, and that I have a disease different from general ADHD.

The symptom I want to cure the most right now is executive function disorder. Also, I have poor spatial awareness, and I think there may be a problem with my cerebellum. Also, considering that I suffered from OCD, I may have a problem with the basal ganglia.

In this case,

① What disorders (mainly brain?) could I have? If possible, I would appreciate it if you could give me a comprehensive list.

② What drugs or treatments do you think are worth trying? I would like some ideas, even if they are just your subjective opinions.

I would like to try methylene blue, fasoracetam, and memantine from now on.

Agmatine had no effect at all, because I feel like there is something wrong with glutamate (but I feel like I have a more fundamental brain disorder.

I have a very complicated relationship with medication (self image issues caused my addict parents and ptsd) but a very trusting and open one regarding it with my Dr + substance abuse has never been an issue for me. SO it’s not per the bottle, it’s what works for me in this unexpected situation so I don’t crash out or break any of the good strides I’ve made. 


I did take it per the bottle my first day (in the first half). I hated the onset of the ir 20mg, it made my brain fog awful, and just made me hard to feel feelings around. Super intense. It evened out later in the day and I was back to normal after a 10mg and lunch. After lunch I felt it wearing off, I haven’t necessarily felt a “crash”, don’t ever really at all typically. I could feel exec. dysfunction taking back over. I took 20mgs to make it through the day at work, and then 10mgs for the drive home and I was fine the rest of the day. No probs eating or sleeping. 

Next day, I started with 10 mgs, then 20mgs after I got to work. Made it until lunch, ate a chicky dilla smoothie and took another 20mgs to get through the day. On my drive home I felt fine, but forgot I had to run errands and make some calls so I took at 5 mg around 6, ate dinner had a smoothie finished my day and was ready for bed by ten. 

The downsides are, I’m talking A LOT. I’m normally a yapper tho and have been before my diagnosis and treatment, (big factor probably lol). This is the only big downside aside from anxiety and overthinking. Although I was ready for bed at 10, I kept editing and retyping a post in here asking if I’m an addict… not because I took so much, (I just got over med anxiety and associating myself as a drug addict.) But simply because of how much I talked, leading me to believe co workers are suspecting me of abusing my adhd meds… (literally all because I talked their head off day 1, and then day 2 they didn’t talk to me at all. I can pick up on social cues and my co workers n me have a great working relationship where we can set boundaries but didn’t sense any day 1, but maybe was over analyzing in day2???)

I also suffer from pmdd, my normal regiment also helps me treat those symptoms as well and makes the weeks b4 my period more tolerable. I’m expecting my period any day and going through a breakup, so I’m also now thinking this could b a factor….thoughts?

I'm chronicly stressed, I've got 2 points in my life where I started to get anxious then I really got anxious, I'm never not stressed I've always got nervous energy, I'm overthinking all the time, I can't think when I'm on the spot or deeply stressed, I can't go date and can hardly work because of it

I've tried depression tablets but they don't work for me (SSRI) 

My phycatrist started me with 30mg of vyvanse which was way too much, now I'm on 2x 5mg tablets of aspen dexamfetamine, I'm even more stressed and paranoid and I keep seeing things move at the corners of my eyes (like some sort of black rat running along a wall, when I go to look it's not there)

I've always been paranoid and anxious even as a young kid

Apperntly when I was 2 I was really advanced with speaking and very clear, then I stopped speaking and had to relearn which was really hard

In stressful places like schools I've had different problems like blinking heaps and stuttering but at different occasions, I don't do that anymore but now I can't help to mumble words while thinking. 

I was also a premature baby

I've also struggled with social anxiety and confused on how people turn and and screw people over 

I get obsessed over people and things aswell including my trade , psychology and how the brain works to fix myself 

I get into bad depressive spirals for no reason and when I'm really happy or excited it's hard to calm down

I go out most weekends with a friend to bars and pubs, achohol works to calm my head and meet new people

I have strong guilt and really low self esteem, I'm over weight for my height but I'm constantly working

Ritalin drove away ideations of giving up permanently on life if you know what I mean.

As for Klonopin this one benzo ALWAYS stops crippling, crushing bouts of severe anxiety attacks that can last for DAYS once triggered. Got 2 sources of trauma; once brain gets a ""reminder"" - instant terror. Klonopin never failed whereas Xanax even did as did Ativan and others.
In short - not having Klonopin during attacks caused me to nearly die once, get jumped at night another time, break the law by buying Oxycontin via illicit means once doc denied benzos.

Ritalin - ""legal speed""; Klonopin -""hard as opioids or other hard drugs"".

First I manage to have, the second is more needed in emergencies.

Thus I live in fear now, denied Klonopin and a trigger can come unexpectedly - learned that.

2025-05-15 21:45:56;Tension/agitation in the body: anxiety or ADHD ?;"Hi everyone!

Hope you're all surviving the week !

Long story short, I've been diagnosed GAD (panic option) and ADHD last year (1 month before my 30 !). I've been diagnosed very late because I internalise everything. Even I though I was someone very calm and chill... until i try ritalin !

Now I'm taking paxil (GOAT) and ritalin. 

Yet, I kind of struggle with bodily sensations. I thought it was ADHD, as it's very chaotic. It's feels like there is soft lava under my skin (kinda strange !). Also I feel pressures, between the eyes, on the chest... 
And every time, ritalin helps at the beginning... Then make things worst.

So I'm wondering, is this ""bodily hyperactivity"" really part of ADHD, or is it just my sweet anxiety doing her job off cover ?

(Side note: I might have autism as well as I'm unable to feel/understand my emotions).

Can someone relate with that ?

2025-05-14 19:49:06;Vyvase not working?;"Hi there, so I got diagnosed with ADHD sometime ago and my psychiatrist said I tick all of the boxes for someone who has ADHD. The main issues I struggle with and have since I was young are (and still have these exact same issues with not much improvement):

\-Being a slow learner and people having to explain things to me multiple times, and sometimes I'll forget and they'll need to re-explain it (very bad for the workplace, it's actually part of the reason I've been fired and have been told by my managers that ""I just don't seem to get it"")

\- Poor attention to detail (I've worked on this issue a lot but it's a big struggle of mine)

\- Bad concentration (always been a major issue, my mind is always elsewhere, a lot of the time it's a anti-boredom mechanism for me to keep myself entertained when I'm doing boring work, but even when I'm not my mind is still always occupied. This also affects my attention to detail)

\- Bad memory (seems to be linked to my bad concentration)

\- Low energy (always feel tired/sleepy and low energyish but nothing to do with bad sleep, as my sleep has improved a lot over the years and if I'm working from home I'm quite happy with the quality)

I got prescribed 30mg of Vyvnase and it seemed to give me more of a placebo affect from what I can tell. I seemed to have more energy throughout the day. I then got prescribed 50mg, and it seemed to make a difference in my energy levels and even when I was procrasting all day on my phone scrolling on Instagram, I felt different. Even though I was getting these dopamine hits, after I got off my phone I could work and I wouldn't feel sleepy or feel like the day is dragging on like how it usually is when I don't take Vyvnase.

My question is, are my expectations wrong? Or will I have to keep experimenting with different medications until I find something that works? I don't want to go to a higher dose of Vyvnase as I don't think it's going to do anything.

Vyvnase didn't help with any of the above issues except the low energy problem. But I really need to fix my concentration as the main point as it will helping all those other areas. It's been super frustrating dealing with this my whole life, a lot of jobs I've been terminated from because of my bad performance.";r/adhd_anxiety;5;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kmd4h3/vyvase_not_working/

2025-05-13 00:04:24;Symptom check;"My new medication manager just told me I have ADHD. I am unsure of the validity of this diagnosis. I was diagnosed 9 years ago with anxiety. Before that initial anxiety diagnosis I'd lived for years thinking I was dying due to some of my symptoms. Those symptoms have greatly reduced over the years and I don't often notice them at all anymore. Two weeks ago I lost one of my medications and have been off of it since. It is for depression, not anxiety. At first I thought I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms but they have persisted and even worsened. I used to live with these all of the time, for years and it's really bringing a lot up for me emotionally.

The symptoms are: Disorientation when I walk, turn my head, stand up, even just when switching tasks. Fleeting numbness around my nose and mouth. Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping back into a dissociative headspace, but luckily, so far, it hasn't culminated in losing touch fully.

I will be meeting with my prescriber shortly, but I wonder if anyone has had similar symptoms and if you know what they are attributed to? I am scared at this point and my prescribed is new and I don't trust them.";r/adhd_anxiety;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kkwarz/symptom_check/
2025-05-12 20:42:58;How do people with both ADHD and bipolar react to stimulants compared to those with just ADHD or ADHD + anxiety?;"Hey everyone,

I'm looking to understand how different comorbidities impact how people with ADHD respond to stimulants. If you have ADHD along with bipolar disorder (Bipolar II or on the spectrum), how do you personally react to medications like Adderall, Vyvanse, or Concerta?

A few specific questions:

1-Do stimulants help at first but then trigger anxiety, agitation, emotional distress, or depression?

2-Have mood stabilizers (like Lamotrigine or Lithium) helped you handle stimulants better?

I am trying to compare this with experiences from people who have:

1-ADHD only

2-ADHD with anxiety (but no mood swings or mixed features)

I'd really appreciate hearing how your diagnosis unfolded and what treatments have or haven’t worked for you.

2025-05-12 05:55:03;ADHD as a contributing factor to health anxiety;"I’m (f38) wondering if anyone can relate to this but I think my ADHD is a big contributing factor in how anxious I feel about developing serious health problems. Ironically, I was also diagnosed with MS a few years ago and I struggle with the anxiety of that but so far it hasn’t caused me any issues.  For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with health anxiety more than most people I know. And because of my ADHD, which was diagnosed as an adult and explained SO much, life generally feels overwhelming even when my life is externally no busier or more stressful than most people’s my age. I feel like life and all its responsibilities has been so hard to keep up with and frankly I haven’t been keeping up and am pretty behind but that’s for another post. But I have always felt like I was barely treading water and often doing it poorly or not at all and that’s all while being healthy and feeling good. So even though I didn’t know I had ADHD until later I have always had this sense that I wouldn’t be able to handle one more thing making life more difficult to manage, like if I can’t seem to handle stress and responsibilities when I feel good then how can I possibly handle them when I have to manage health issues that make life that much harder than it already is?? Anyway I didn’t mean for this to be so long and I don’t mean to offend anyone with health conditions, I’m very sorry if I did. I hope all this at least makes sense. 

TL;DR: I think having ADHD is a big factor in why I have always been so worried about my health or developing serious health problems.   ";r/adhd_anxiety;17;12;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kkcgrn/adhd_as_a_contributing_factor_to_health_anxiety/
2025-05-11 16:24:06;how does your ADHD affect your dating life and how do you deal with it?;"i (f24) got diagnosed with adhd (combined type) this week. this makes me think about how adhd has affected my dating life and keeping romantic relationships with people. i feel like adhd makes me feel very anxious and sensitive to rejection, probably due to RSD, but it could also be because of my attachment style (anxious/avoidant) depending on the person i’m with and what their attachment style is.

i’m currently dating someone (f25) and we’ve been talking for more than 5 weeks, texting daily and also have seen each other 5 times now. the thing is… i feel like i might start to actually like her and that thought scares me. it makes me do a lot of self sabotaging. like trying to find things that i don’t like about her so i can have a reason to break things off. i want to run away, because i don’t know how she is feeling about me and that uncertainty is making me freak out. i was so impulsive yesterday and overthinking where our connection was leading to, that i ended up sending her a 10minute long voice message at midnight, asking her how she saw our connection and what she was looking for in a person and basically i was like being pretty intense with my own thoughts and feelings and how i saw our connection and i was just trying to figure out if our interest in each other was mutual, because i don’t seem to pick up from her behaviour. she is pretty nonchalant but she has a secure attachment style and overall has the kind of attitude of “i will see how it goes”and i am absolutely NOT nonchalant. i tend to overshare and put myself in a vulnerable state without the other person asking me to, maybe out of attempt to find out if the other person also feels the same way as me and can deal with me. but i can imagine this being way too intense and overwhelming for most people, especially during the start of the dating stage…

so i wonder if anyone else is struggling with this too. i feel like i’m scaring people away with my honesty and transparency. and i’m just a pretty straight forward type of person. if i like someone, i don’t feel the need to hide that or stay mysterious about it. i often just come off as “too much.” and i really don’t know how to deal with myself.

2025-05-10 15:37:29;Medicate the anxiety too?;"I just got my ADHD diagnosis this week, yay! I've started Ritalin which has made a little difference, but I think I'll need to up the dose when I speak to my psychiatrist next week. I also got diagnosed with anxiety (which I knew) and historic depressive episodes (didn't know). My psychiatrist has offered the option of treating the anxiety once I am settled on my ADHD meds. I tried Citalopram a few years ago and the side effects while I was getting used to it was honestly one of the worst experiences of my life. I was on it for two years and it was ok, I guess?

I just wondered what everyone else's experiences have been like with anxiety+ADHD and medicating both or only one. The first day I tried Ritalin I felt good, but it's day 3 and I feel quite physically anxious. I can't tell if it's the drugs or whether I'm just extra aware of how I'm feeling, and therefore feeling anxious because of it. I'm not sure I want to try anxiety meds again. I know there are other options apart from Citalopram but I'm feeling very wary. Maybe it's too early to be thinking all this and I need to give my body more time to get used to the Ritalin? Maybe I need to chill the fuck out and stop overthinking everything?! ";r/adhd_anxiety;6;7;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kj4rsh/medicate_the_anxiety_too/

I am a 27yo female, who has mental illness trickling throughout her family yet no one (except an aunt and cousin) has been medically diagnosed and treated. You know how it is, mental health and medication wasn't really talked about growing up (although it was very much an issue ... bipolar, ocd, anxiety, depression, adhd tendencies from my father) and I have been struggling with anxiety for as long as I remember. It's manifested differently over the years, but I realized in college that I wasn't operating like my peers/ it wasn't normal to experience what I was experiencing. Anyways, I am at my wits end because I have been managing okay (ish) my entire life but I just can't anymore. I need help, I'm so overwhelmed. My friends with adhd all think I have it and that it could be the root of my anxiety... so I decided to seek a psychiatrist because therapy has only done so much (I started therapy a couple years ago). Long story short... Do you have any advice on what I say to this psychiatrist? What do I ask? How do I propose my history/issues etc. to the best of my abilities so I get accurate help? Any advice or suggestions on how to approach this appointment next week would be really appreciated!!

2025-05-10 00:36:33;THE DOMINO EFFECT(as in my life is failing apart with my mental health);"I feel really depressed. I have exams coming up soon and I can’t study. Unless what I have heard about about ADHD most people do there best work on a deadline. Personally I get into depression and think of how I will fail. I am unable to study because I feel paralyzed my the negative thoughts in my head.

I relate a lot with people with ADHD but I have not yet been officially diagnosed. I just don’t have the money to get tested by a therapist. Therapist are expensive and I know I need it but I don’t have the money for it. I can’t afford to have ADHD either, not that it’s a choice but I have so many responsibilities.

I come from a family of four and I am the last born. My eldest brother died when I was only in high school( may his soul rest in peace), the second born(my elder sister) has three kids and one on the way with an income that can barely sustain her, my immediate elder brother recently left prison with no high school certificate and is an aspiring rapper. In short both my siblings have nothing but primary school certificate. My mother is struggling but she’s not as young as she used to be. My father is late. Hence it’s a lot of pressure considering I am the only one in university.

My school life is going horribly, I repeated first year 3 times and currently in my second year struggling. I failed my first semester and I need to prepare for my second but my mental health is failing me.

I have tried business and failed. I had a business with my ex in which he scammed me and three others who were part of our team. Knowing that if I don’t make this semester I decided to save up money which I gave to my current boyfriend to keep because if I kept it I would use it. Instead he used it and I just forgave him and put it under bad debts. I trying to join the stock market but the documentation is energy consuming considering i am in a foreign country.

I trust easily and I feel like a fool. My boyfriend cheated on me and my ex scammed me. I am trying to recover but it’s hard to get up with all the pressure.

I struggle with depression consistently because my fear of not being enough seemed to have been proven when my boyfriend cheated on me.

I don’t have money. My family doesn’t have money. I come from generational poverty and I don’t want to end up there because I have ADHD and can’t get myself out of depression quick enough. I would love to get a therapist but I have no money. I wish I can talk to family or friends but I barely have friends and the ones I do have, I am not yet confortable sharing my vulnerability with yet. Because they bring it up in jokes or just not take it seriously.

Also I often felt like a burden growing up so it’s really hard to put my mental struggles on people.

How can I navigate ADHD or at least stop being in denial and actually work with it. Did anyone else struggle with accepting it? My friends point it out because I behave or react to things.

I need help, any advice on the above would mean a lot.";r/adhd_anxiety;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kimycc/the_domino_effectas_in_my_life_is_failing_apart/

2025-05-08 12:19:12;Books felt impossible because of my ADHD brain, but now I finish them without forcing it;"I’m 25 and have had an ADHD diagnosis since I was about 15. For most of my life, I just assumed books weren’t really for me. I’d try to read and either feel bored or zone out completely. I figured it was just something my brain couldn’t do. But about a year ago, I picked up a random book out of pure boredom. And surprisingly, I didn’t hate it. I didn’t finish it in one go or anything, but I kept coming back to it. It felt different. 

Now it’s been a year since I started trying to read more, and I’ve noticed some changes - even if my attention span still isn’t amazing. I still can’t read for hours on end. On average, I hit 30 minutes before my brain wants to do something else. But sometimes, if the book hits right, I can go for 2 hours straight. Other times, I open a book and close it after one page. It’s inconsistent, but it’s progress.

I’ve spent the past few months testing different ways to make reading easier. I didn’t try to “fix” my attention span, I just worked with what I had. These are a few things that actually helped me build a reading habit and made my free time feel more meaningful instead of just watching short videos or scrolling:

\- Listening to no-talking ASMR or white noise with headphones: it blocks out background distractions without adding more input to process.

\- video game music loops: they’re composed to hold your attention without being distracting or annoying. I listened to Animal Crossing music and felt really relaxed while reading.

\- Audiobooks are a lifesaver. Especially for books I struggle to get into. Sometimes I listen to the first chapter, or the book summary, and then switch to reading.

\- Using a pen or finger to follow the text: sounds simple but it helps keep my eyes from wandering.

\- Reading in short sessions (10–25 mins) instead of trying to force hour-long deep focus sessions.

I’m not reading 100 books a year or anything. But I’m reading more than I used to. And I’m enjoying it, which is the main thing. If you’re also struggling to focus or feeling like reading just isn’t for you, it might just be that you need a different approach, not a different brain.

Here are some resources (videos/apps/podcasts/tools…) that helped me along the way, either recommended by my therapist or things I found on my own:

\- Music Loop Videos on YouTube: You can search for any your favorite game name + ASMR/calm/relax/jazz cafe music etc… to find your fav music channel. Movies also work!

\- Forest App: I’ve been using this since high school and grow trees with my friend. You plant a tree while you focus, and it dies if you check your phone. Sounds dumb, but it works. Especially when I’m trying to stay offline while reading.

\- BeFreed: This one’s a smart reading app that basically condenses books into short versions (10-min skims, 40-min deep dives, or full storytelling mode). It’s like having a personal YouTuber explain the book to you. I use it when I want to preview a book before reading the full thing, or when I can’t get through a dense chapter. I really like the flashcards that reinforce the key points of the book without having to read long sentences multiple times for nonfiction books. Definitely helped me read more without burning out.

\- Readwise: This one is more for after you read. It saves your highlights and sends you a daily email to remind you of what you’ve read. Helps with memory and makes the reading feel more useful.

\- Hacking Your ADHD Podcast (on many different platforms): the episodes are short, easily digestible and packed w helpful material on ADHD management. I usually listen to it before sleep.

And here are some awesome books I’ve read this year that may helpful for ADHDers like me:

\- How to Keep House While Drowning: A game-changer for releasing shame around “messy” living. The author gives practical, non-judgmental strategies that work with our brain, not against it.

\- The Adult ADHD Toolkit: Other redditors recommended this book to me. Super helpful for understanding how ADHD actually works in real life. It’s full of real strategies (not just “try harder”) and breaks down the science in a way that makes sense.

\- What Happened to You by Oprah & Dr. Bruce Perry: Not ADHD-specific, but incredibly powerful. It helped me connect the dots between trauma, nervous system dysregulation, and how I respond to stress and overwhelm.

Reading isn’t some magical cure. I still sometimes scroll. I still get distracted. But having reading as an option has made a difference. It’s something I do for myself. Some days it’s 5 pages, some days it’s 50. Either way, it feels better than doomscrolling.

If you’ve been wanting to get into reading but feel like your brain just isn’t built for it, it’s about finding the right conditions so reading feels easier.";r/adhd_anxiety;17;7;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1khhemy/books_felt_impossible_because_of_my_adhd_brain/
2025-05-07 16:23:32;Should I continue with therapy?;"I got diagnosed with mild ADHD in my childhood but wasn't aware of it until much later. Not getting into the specifics, I was put on medication during the pandemic. It helped for a while but I also noticed major personality shifts. Like yea I could concentrate and focus more but I didn't feel like myself anymore. Since then, I have been extremely irregular with my meds and psychiatrist visits.

My psychiatrist also diagnosed me with panic disorder and I don't think that's right either :/ 
I have tried several psychologists but they were never quite the right fit for me. My current psychologist is good (I think?) but her schedule is really packed and we haven't been able to have sessions as regularly as recommended. 

I'm really struggling and want to seek help but it feels like every time I try I get disappointed. I think I've gotten to the point where my anxiety is constantly consuming me and I haven't gotten out of the house in weeks, I've missed classes, appointments, social events and I refuse to hang out with my friends outside my house no matter how much they try to convince me. I'm tired of looking for good psychologists in my area, I don't want to go through something as painful as baring my whole heart out to a person just for them to dismiss or disregard me. I don't want to go through several more rounds of trial and error where I'm crying in a stranger's office. 

I would love to have short term solutions, but I'm aware therapy doesn't work that way. Should I continue with therapy, seek other options or smth else?

I'm sorry if this sounded more like a rant post.

tldr: I can't schedule enough sessions with my current psychologist. Should I continue seeking therapy from her, seek other psychologists or quit therapy entirely?";r/adhd_anxiety;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kgs8ej/should_i_continue_with_therapy/
2025-05-06 21:20:36;First time Ritalin and scared!;"I’m a 38-year-old woman and was recently diagnosed with combined-type ADHD. I’ve been on an SSRI for years for a panic disorder, but it hasn’t really helped, and the effects seem to have completely worn off.

Tomorrow, I’ll be starting Ritalin for the first time—an extended-release version. We’re going to see if it helps reduce my anxiety and brings some peace to my mind. I constantly talk myself into anxiety and never feel mentally calm.

And I’m terrified—even though I don’t even have the pills at home yet. I’m really scared to take it, afraid that it will have the opposite effect and leave me in a state of panic all day.

It’s so strange because I was really looking forward to this, and now that the time has come, all I feel is resistance and fear.

Have others experienced a sense of calm with Ritalin?

Update 1: so first update after an hour. I was panicking bad, very bad and very afraid. And all of a sudden, my brain went quiet. It was the most weird experience. I’m playing a video game now, didn’t plan much today. And I can just concentrate on the game and am not bothered by anything else (like my own brain yelling at me). I will keep you posted!

Update 2:
The day went great. Nothing to be afraid of. No weird rebound or anything, just a clear mind. Had grouptherapy (online) and could concentrate the whole time. Sometimes a little panicky, but it went away quickly. I’m very hopeful for the next days 🙏

2025-05-06 06:11:31;First date followup;"

 I (28m) went on a date with a man who has ADHD(dx) (officialy diagnosed, on meds based on what he shared). I was initially planning to hang out for maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it went on for 6 hours. It was a great first date and he did everything right and made me feel validated and showed he was into me using physical touch and all that. He also spoke about future things, like inviting me on a drive to the Eifel (the forest not the tower) and the beach and going stargazing. Unprompted.

 I'm usually very cautious on a first date but he was so captivating and sweet and nice and upfront about a lot of things that I couldn't help but believe in the pictures he was painting. Fast forward 4 days, and not a peep from him. I messaged him once yesterday but no reply at all. 

I know he has a busy schedule so I wasn't so surprised but he has been online a few times since so I don't know if this is a ghost or a cold shoulder.  An important piece of info is that he *didnt* take his meds the day of the date.

The reason I'm asking in this sub is that chatgpt told me that sometimes, especially when unmedicated, people with adhd can make plans in the moment they don't intend on following through. They could completely mean them but later forget or change their mind. I don't know anyone with adhd at this level of close contact, so have no idea if this is true. I was hoping  I could get some input here, and advice about how to navigate this.

2025-05-05 13:53:07;Zoloft and Adderall;Hey guys. So I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 17 but did not medicate until 6 months ago at the age of 33. I was given 10mg of adderall and when I say it was a life saver, it was. For the first time I felt like myself, I could concentrate, get work done. My depression lifted because I was finally able to do things like organize stuff around the house without breaking down mentally, I could remember things and it no longer took me 2 hours to just leave the house. I would only take it during the week and off during the weekend. I stopped it 3 months ago and I had no issues doing that other than having ADHD symptoms. 1.5 months ago I went through a very traumatic event which triggered really bad and severe PTSD coupled with long covid. I was having panic attacks in a daily basis. I was put on Zoloft 50mg and it has really helps my panic attacks. I was told by my doctor that I could take Adderall. I took 5 mg in the morning. I started having some anxiety with adderall despite me never having side affect from adderall. And on top of the fact that the adderall doesn’t work nearly as well as it used to when I wasn’t taking Zoloft. Zoloft blunts my emotions a bit. I can still feel emotions but I can’t cry. Well, I took adderall and like an hour later I broke down and cried. The adderall made me super emotional and I’ve been wanting to cry all day long. Has anyone had a similar experience. I’m debating if I should continue this and see if it levels down? I’m a bit disheartened because Adderall worked so well and it was God sent. It worked that good and had never given me anxiety. I’ve only been on Zoloft for 6 weeks and my panic attacks are gone. It’s like choosing panic attacks or debilitating ADHD which I feel the Zoloft has worsen my ADHD. ;r/adhd_anxiety;5;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1kf4e89/zoloft_and_adderall/
2025-05-05 07:18:02;29M — ADHD, Procrastination, Weed, and the Pain of “Almost Starting Everything But Finishing Nothing;"
Hey everyone,
I’m 29, probably ADHD (not officially diagnosed yet), and stuck in a loop that’s slowly crushing me.

I don’t feel like I have any real skills. I’ve dabbled in software/dev, a few startup ideas, some marketing — but I’ve never finished anything properly.
I start things, get hyped, talk about them, plan them to death… then burn out, disappear, and hate myself for never finishing.

I smoke weed almost every day. At first it was to “relax,” to reduce stress, to feel something good.
But now it’s become a way to avoid doing anything hard. I use it to numb the shame, the pressure, the fear of not being good enough.
And even though I know it’s making things worse — I still do it. That makes me feel even more like a failure.

It’s like my brain gives me a reward for just talking about projects. I explain them, sketch them out, maybe even write a few lines of code — and then I feel like I’ve done something.
But I haven’t. I just tricked myself. And the real work never happens.

I feel fake. Lazy. Like the people around me see potential in me that I can't live up to. It’s not pressure from them — it’s pressure I feel inside because I know I’m not doing what I could be doing.

I’m tired of:

Starting 20% of a project then ghosting it

Escaping into weed, YouTube, shows, or endless overthinking

Waking up already disappointed in myself

Feeling like I missed my shot, and now I’m just pretending


I’ve been trying lately. For real. I’ve started tackling small bugs I used to avoid. I’ve even started choosing effort over escape, just a little bit.
But the fear of going back to that “disappear and relapse” version of me is always hovering.

If anyone here has dealt with this — ADHD, weed, false starts, shame, unfinished projects — how did you break the cycle?
How do you find structure when you feel like your self-trust is gone?

The tests are expensive, so I’m trying to decide if they’re worth it. I’d love to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD later in life—
Did the diagnosis and treatment make a meaningful difference for you?

2025-04-30 05:23:01;Adhd? Boh…;Good evening, I recently turned 20 and I think I have ADHD. I did some research and read that to get a diagnosis I would have to go to a psychiatrist, and so I did. I have never had to deal with a psychologist or even a psychiatrist, so I had the first session, he asked me some personal questions and it lasted about an hour. He informed me that he did not deal with ADHD specifically, but he still asked me some questions about the deficit and made a request for the doctor specialized in ADHD, so that I could also go to the other doctor for some tests. I told him about some of my problems, related to the dissatisfaction I am having at an academic level and he and another doctor prescribed me three drugs and made requests for other visits... Have you had experiences like this? Did you find them positive? I am a bit hesitant because I am 20 years old and I would not like to depend on any medicine of this kind, especially if they have spoken to me for not just an hour. I would also like to discuss it privately with someone, if you have had to deal with a psychiatrist...

She dismissed me entirely and said I might simply have a personality disorder. I was NOT happy. Today, I tried again. Finally talked it through with someone who, IMO, was actually educated in psychiatry. We talked it through, I mentioned my symptoms, and I explained a bit in detail. She believes I have Attention Deficit Disorder. I guess that means 50% ADHD😅 Well, thats my story for now.

2025-04-29 17:07:30;Counterproductive Introspection;"Not asking for a diagnosis, just thoughts based on personal experiences and facts. Has anyone experienced/ witnessed anything similar?


My gp wanted me to get tested for adhd. My psychiatrist focused on educating me about my mixed episodes.

For me, it’s feeling like I can do anything but don’t have the energy to. When I actually do something about my ideas, hundreds of realizations and trauma processing come up. 

When I notice so much, too much, I crave perceiving and feeling the mundane things/situations/sights in depth. The mundane remains mundane to everyone. And I honestly just want to live through and flow through the mundane with appreciation instead of fear and disgust.


Past 2 months:
My state wasn’t sudden, I felt it slowly building up like I always do. Been very critical about myself physically and mentally… so much doubts (my abilities) and disbelief (as in I literally have headaches because I didn’t wanna speak cos i felt like whatever came out of my mouth aren’t true/proven haha or I isolate cos I feel like no one knows what they’re saying and it’ll just cloud my already clouded mind)


I was having a really really really hard time looking after myself and needed a change of environment. The dissociation has been affecting me big time and I’m sure the people around me have been somewhat affected by it too. Working on grounding, I wanna feel less hollow.

I feel like my body has been decaying, dying. My tension pains and aches have been taking over me. 

Earlier, I had to bite my fist and feel the backs of my teeth with my finger tips/ apply pressure on em cos I needed to feel that I am here. That I can snap out of it. Out of my head.

Piling thoughts around:
- Mama not being here forever → grieving my loss for something that’s still in front of me.
- Lingering pressure to understand the purpose of getting my diploma on photography → What are you gonna do next? Sell stock photos/ photography service? Become a director?
- Why am i taking ages to get past the 4 sentences on an essay that was due 2 weeks ago?
- Looking at nostalgic photos from the past and trying to ignite the now gone carefree artist in me. Why am I so technical? Back/neck/shoulder pain.
- Challenges are amplified and it’s difficult to open myself up to good change. I want to process this and that. I have to be very careful because I’ve put myself in a lot of risk in a short amount of time.
- Connecting and then reviewing my emotional/mental/behavioural patterns in each relationship.
- Tension pains. Homeostasis struggle is real. Water intake is never enough, I still need to always take huge deep breaths and put in so much effort to carry/ straighten up my back.
- Songs constantly playing in my head, maybe to soothe and slow my thoughts done.

This morning, while walking to the bus stop, I focused on getting from one point to a marker (any leaf/ water meters) that’s around 5-20 meters im front. Training my vision and brain to focus on getting the the next nearest point without looking too much into the process of getting home as a WHOLE.

-> done regular chiropractic adjustments before, cbt and trauma-informed therapy, am on antipsychotics+mood stabilizers+antidepressants

I always thought I had anxiety especially school and productivity. But now I am wondering if maybe I have ADHD and don't realize it. I am a male in my early 20s and I will admit I'm pretty high functioning but just not hyper at all. My Dad is diagnosed with ADHD as well so that is another factor to consider.

I don't want to jump to conclusions or self diagnose but I really feel great on Vyvanse. I just feel less tense and honestly more free. I want to bring this up to my therapist, but I also want to hear other opinions first.

I would love to hear from anyone who has gone through something like this or is knowledgable in this area. If I am tripping, please tell me. I would appreciate any help or discussion on this matter.";r/adhd_anxiety;8;13;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1k69mrb/vyvanse_erases_my_anxiety_could_this_be_a_sign_of/

I did a lot of research and it would definitely basically explain my whole life haha. And I actually think my mom has it as well. 


I spent the last few years travelling a lot and doing odd jobs in between bc I realised I can’t really function in normal society I guess? I just always thought I was weird. And now I took a break from it for a few months and went back home. But I feel like my symptoms are pretty bad now. My thoughts are racing so much and I don’t know if I actually have adhd or not. I want to get assessed but I don’t have the money for it right now and I feel like I’m just gonna keep obsessing over it until I get an answer. I don’t know what to do haha.

“But everyone has that”.

Honestly that doesn't bother me and I would have said the same thing before I was diagnosed. 

But then I tell them this:  
I can be in the middle of a 1 on 1 conversation with my manager, talking about something that I'm actually interested in. He's speaking directly to me, and I'll have a random tangential thought. Thirty seconds later I will zone back into the conversation because I need to respond to him, and have to guess what he was talking about.

2025-04-19 07:04:24;Wondering if I may have ADHD;"Hello everyone, I am a 19-year-old male who is currently in University, but having a rough time overall, and I am now realizing that some of this could possibly be a sign I may have ADHD. For some background, I was homeschooled my entire life, and didn't have a lot of structure at all when I was at home. I also was (and still am) a very anxious person in general, and also may have OCD, as I have had several severe bouts of intrusive thoughts that made me feel so bad that I could barely eat.   
  
I talked to the therapist I had on campus about this, and he said he was pretty sure it was OCD, but since it was just for a semester, I wasn't able to get a proper diagnosis for anything. When I was younger, these things didn't affect me as badly (in interfering with school)  because I didn't really start doing schoolwork properly until high school. I did do math, though, and it was always a constant struggle for me, as it was hard to understand and took me such a long time to complete the problems. 

This was caused by a mixture of my not understanding it, as well as getting distracted and daydreaming, or running off to read a book or play with Legos. I tended to avoid harder or more complicated tasks in general when I was younger, as it would always take me a gruelingly long time to complete them. I find it hard to focus and stay motivated. This really affects my grades (in high school, but it's even been worse in University). I just don't want to burn out and become even worse because this first semester (I am a freshman) has already been pretty rough, and I know this will be unsustainable for 4 or 5 years.";r/adhd_anxiety;2;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1k2i7s0/wondering_if_i_may_have_adhd/
2025-04-18 14:26:53;Neuropsychologist or psychiatrist for diagnosis/medication?;"I talked to my PCP about my (undiagnosed) ADHD and he referred me to see either a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist. This was a new PCP who I seeked out since my parents and I had the same PCP and we split due to recent events. I had just one visit with this man but he was truly an amazing listener and made me feel so heard. He did suggest that I preferably go to a private practice because a lot of big name providers are ultimately pill pushers. My primary goal/intended first step is to medicated because going off of my many years of introspection, I am 99% confident that medication is the only thing that can truly help me with my ADHD and put me in a place where I can make positive changes. I don't expect to take the pills and magically have all my problems go away, but I hope that will be the catalyst for my self-betterment.

Anyways, In classic ADHD fashion, I got this referral in December and it is currently April, whoops. I'm not necessarily looking to get evaluated, diagnosed, receive a prescription, and never see the doctor again, but I am afraid of wasting time and money on a doctor who will dismiss my issues. Of course, neither a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist are inherently better/worse for this, but I would appreciate any personal stories or professional insight as to what would be best given my situation. I would reach out to ask my PCP again and I'm sure he'd be receptive but I'm embarrassed about having put this off for so long (I also want answers now at 2AM lol).";r/adhd_anxiety;1;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1k1y9ga/neuropsychologist_or_psychiatrist_for/
2025-04-18 13:56:09;at a loss;"I just turned 25 this past February, and I feel completely lost. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Out of everything, I feel like ADHD has impacted my ability to learn the most—it’s been a struggle for as long as I can remember.

I never really got a proper education. I might’ve made it to freshman year, but after that, everything fell apart. I’ve never had a traditional job—only under-the-table work or self-employment. Now I’m trying to get my life together, but I have no idea where to start, and it’s driving me crazy.

I’ve been trying to study for my GED, but every time I open the book, I feel like I’m not really learning. It’s more like it’s just preparing me for the test without teaching me any real foundational knowledge. Maybe I’m wrong, but that’s how it feels. And I don’t just want to pass a test—I want to actually learn. I want to absorb academic knowledge. I want to understand the world in the way educated people do. I want to be smart, to be intelligent, to feel confident in my ability to learn and grow.

I’d love to take college courses one day in subjects I’m passionate about. Honestly, I’m passionate about knowledge in general. I just don’t know how to get to that point. I don’t know how to bridge the gap between where I am now and where I dream of being. It’s like there’s something in my brain that blocks me from learning in traditional ways, and I haven’t figured out what works for me yet.

I’m on multiple medications, including ADHD meds. They help me regulate my emotions, but they don’t help me focus the way other people describe. Sometimes I wonder if I have another undiagnosed learning disability, because no matter how hard I try to study, it feels like my brain just refuses to cooperate.

The only time I’ve really been able to learn is when I’m deeply interested in something. But when it comes to school, or anything I have to do, I feel hopeless. I feel stupid. And more than anything, I feel scared for my future. There are days where I think, “What’s the point?” because it feels like I’m already too far behind. But I don’t want to give up. I want to keep trying. I just don’t know how.

I’ve never had support in this. I’ve always had to figure things out on my own. That’s why I’m here now, asking for help—because I don’t know what else to do. If anyone can offer guidance, advice, resources, or even just encouragement, I would be so grateful.

On top of all of this, I’m also supposed to be looking for a part-time job. But most places I’ve applied to either never get back to me or say I need a high school diploma or GED. I don’t know how I’m supposed to manage school, a job, and my mental health all at once when just one of those things feels like too much.

If anyone out there has been through something like this, or knows where I can start—how to learn with ADHD, how to find the right kind of support, or even how to just believe in myself again—please, I’m begging you, help me. I’m trying. I just need someone to point me in the right direction.";r/adhd_anxiety;3;3;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1k1xsz3/at_a_loss/

2025-04-17 23:19:09;Need advice!!;"I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and have tried several medications over the past year: Vyvanse (up to 70mg), Adderall XR and IR, Ritalin, bupropion, and Strattera (which I’m currently on at 60mg). Most of them haven’t helped in a meaningful way. Some gave side effects, others didn’t do much at all, and even the ones that helped a little never brought real clarity or focus.

Right now, I’m still on Strattera 60mg because I think it’s doing something—but honestly, I’m not sure. It’s really hard to tell what’s improving and what isn’t, because I’m stuck in this constant cycle of mentally checking in with myself throughout the day. I wake up already thinking:
	•	“Is this working?”
	•	“Did I make the right decision?”
	•	“What if I’m lying to myself?”
	•	“What if I’m wasting time or doing this wrong?”

These thoughts come automatically. I don’t have visible compulsions or panic, but I get stuck in loops of doubt, checking, analyzing, and trying to be sure. I also experience intrusive thoughts that are sometimes vile or graphic, but I’ve become numb to them—I don’t physically react to them anymore, but they still show up and feed into the overall uncertainty.

A psychologist I saw recently diagnosed me with Pure OCD based on these patterns. And while the diagnosis makes some sense, I still question it. I wonder if this is just ADHD showing up as obsessive thinking, or if I’ve just lived in my head for so long that I don’t know what’s me vs what’s a symptom anymore. Part of me still believes maybe I’m just unlucky with ADHD treatment, or genetically wired in a way that makes medication less effective.

I’ve also noticed I can be very moody, especially around my mom or at home. I’m extremely self-aware of it and feel bad afterward, but in the moment, I sometimes can’t stop it. I don’t know if that’s emotional dysregulation from ADHD, something OCD-related, or another factor.

I’m now looking into possibly starting an SSRI, but I’m honestly terrified. I’m scared of making the wrong choice, scared of side effects, and scared it’ll make things worse instead of better. I don’t know if OCD is really the issue, or if I’m just grasping for a label and hoping something explains all of this.

If anyone has experience with Pure OCD, ADHD + OCD, or this kind of constant internal checking/doubt loop—especially where it affects medication response—I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I just want to understand what I’m actually dealing with so I can move forward without second-guessing every step.

2025-04-16 23:06:34;PLEASE, Anyone in a situation where you have access to fewer meds, how do you cope?;"I am from South Asian country, I was diagnosed for ADHD about 3y ago, before a decade ago diagnosed for OCD, probably autistic too. OCD does not bother me that much, but ADHD does, I procrastinate a lot, mind is always filled with thoughts, difficulty sleeping, emotional dysregulation creating social problems.

I believe I'm smart guy, have first class bachelors in CS (2017), used to work as Sr. SE months ago, left because underpaid work uninteresting. Others also see my talent for work, but wondering why my career is stagnant, we all know why. I procrastinate on things (projects) I love, because my working memory is messy and does not focus on interesting aspects of the project, instead of boring stuff. My peers have move up in their careers and earn well, I feel terrible about myself and distant my self from social connections, here people do not comprehend my problem, they say that I do not have problem, probably because of my education.

About medications:

I have given Atomoxitine by psychiatrist, which only worked for about first two days by clearing mind, I was overjoyed even with high BP, but clarity did not last long. Also have exhaustion, prostate issues.

Then given MPH (Ritalin) (only IR form available), this improves my mood, anxiety, give motivation (better med for anxiety and OCD than the Fluoxetine I used to take for years), but there is no clearing of mind, just a jolt of energy. Problem with this is crashes leads to depression, higher the dose worse the depression. Also, it causes wiered light sweating (feels like body boils from inside) and Diarrhea (having to go to toilet after some time of taking meds).

Then the Bupropion, this does actually nothing except make me forget things I have known for years.

Above are the meds available in our country for ADHD, I wish there was Lisdexamfetamine. There is a form by regulatory authority to import meds, but my doctor keep avoiding that because none have used that form before and probably do not want to deal with bureaucracy.

Also, our MDs do not understand emotional dysregulation part of ADHD, they want to fix things by therapies, do not understand the importance of different release formulations of meds specially in case of comorbid anxiety.

Only things seem to help with physical exercise, but I struggle to get them consistently. Also tried Ashwaghanda, L-Tyrosine but no improvement, have pending order for L-theanine.

Last September, my mom passed after stroke enduring lot of pain, she was already having severe issues due to Parkinsonism. I did help her, but I have regrets not being able to help her fully due to my struggles.

So my questions is, anyone in similar situation? What could I do to get out of this situation?

Edit:

If anyone showing similar response to above medications, what meds worked for you? If I could narrow it down, I could try my psychiatrist to sign the form just once.";r/adhd_anxiety;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1k0mp27/please_anyone_in_a_situation_where_you_have/

I sure had it pending but then canceled when I heard about the landlord wanting eviction because he milked my veterans rental money & “no longer in program” he knew but was very firm on letting me know that he would not release from lease for me or take spouse off when judge ordered eviction on restraining order for her.

So I’m here now.
Stockholm syndrome.
Supportive buddy, but the orally pressed tablets of meth-Adderall is his vice so our money for being 100% service connected is not helpful to him because he cannot handle having a months worth of his supply because he admitted he will go through it too fast. So he goes daily to get them. And that means times of him I found him going through my meds; stole my Dextroamphetamine tablets I had last year. Still showed this behavior of rooting so I left 3 days in.

July I’ll be alone in apartment I can afford fine.

But I have a spouse who is rooting for my downfall to be stuck with her forever. 

Her sense of me not being near her —space has upgraded her meaning to ensure torture to take my mind off what I need.

She plays caretaker & need for ride to work with bus block away. I feel sad. 

The woman I love is dying to have a kid & ensure that I have my soul truly what I think is almost a belief of what that twin flame concept means “parters meant?”

But I want to grieve her
Know I love her
Accept her love and forgive to move forward if she does have peace.

Actually love life for what I haven’t done with what is now on my mind,’ often: “I am okay in all areas, and my sanity is there: I have dependency to meds & addiction to few of them. When away this fresh sense of reducing need through forgetting meds comes over me.

I want to live singly; enjoy running without music still to get back to 40 miles a week like I did alone in army 2021-2022 opened most miles ran (1,200). 

I’m 26 & I’m a young guy who grieved and abused meds to cope with dad & mom (16 for father passing & 18 was mother): I love whoever pointed out she came back into my life during HEAVY grieving. She did best of time to become someone who enjoys law while I was out in Colorado; but there were so many torturous moments of now her linking herself to having bipolar not diagnosed then; that forgiveness without the bipolar there I can have but what hurts and is keeping me up until 3:42am right now, is that the truth overwhelms me that I have strong moments of being in abusiveness, where today I finally ran after 1 week or not because her needs (of house cleaning) was priority, but I became paralyzed by moments from one med stolen & had to withdrawal without it when she recently said to get out over disagreement (similar to me hurting her feelings by sharing my day when asked why I was 2 hours late to home from pharmacy —police pulled over in bad area and searched car seeing meds picked up with fatigue in ms, and let me go, hit unlock on phone and see 20, 30, 40+ calls…, insanity. 


did 2019-2023 and was blessed to have been retired with financial stability, 100% SC means covering enough to pay rent in high rent area, pay a lot close to rent with half still left over each month I was solely paying with her and I there no complaint.

I want a nice moment, to know how life is happy by new times happening.

I think of the amazement of how my interactions go & had blocking this strong potential with women close to my age of 26 while running in an area just 10 minutes away from where I’ll live:
I go have our time loving small talk & big talk into plans of a beach trip, a movie night get bored and go explore our city to spend time, and how amazing it is to reflect on how I appreciate physical attraction  lately because I allowed myself to know I’m able to make friends, but lately the in person interactions have been limited because I can “go easily get girls, so one day I’ll meet a beautiful woman I’ll marry & maybe she’ll appreciate all you do for her, go down & please her while I get the chance to be with a life that’s now wasted time. I was there when you were struggling, so you can’t just let go of 10+ years”.
I’m perfectly fine with wearing my ring outside knowing divorce is imminent, with her time invested in not allowing separation or divorce planning, instead, has 100% valued belief of her of “always be together” and scary for me knowing all of this life.

All of my life & the time I can spend with the part I’m open to start with is my casual guy friendships & casual female friendships with emotions and emotional regulation or whichever it is that works to even have my expression of physical connection in moments that pass in life, knowing this life is livable beyond being so harmful to our lives in all cases where a friend invests hurt or a woman  want forever to instill a forced reaction to wanting more for them, and that’s okay. I just am not okay being all of them,‘with life shut down by any friendship or physical intimacy a normal aspect that I can understand.

My maturity and love for life is hurt and there’s too many quality people to share moments of memories made to think “how happy I was to xyz”

2025-04-12 00:44:53;Medication for ADHD & anxiety;"Hello everyone, my first ever Reddit post 👋🏻
My story: I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago after being in therapy for depression up to that point.
During the last year i was put on different types of methylphenidate and tried Vyvanse during the last weeks. 
Up to a few weeks ago, un-retarded methylphenidate was what worked best for me, as it helps with task paralysis and general energy/drive. While trying Vyvanse, i thought that i feel better at first, because i felt a bit more relaxed and calm, something methylphenidate didnt do for me. But over a few weeks i realized it doesnt help at all with my task paralysis, also energy levels fell, my sleep rhythm was completely messed up and i didnt do a lot of things i should have done.
During a session with my ergotherapeut (i see her as an addition to my Doc), i realized im probably suffering from anxiety for almost all of my life, but never truly realized this. Now that the penny dropped this seems crystal clear to me.
So my theory is that methylphenidate helps with my ADHD related symptoms, while Vyvanse maybe has helped a little bit with Anxiety symptoms, but both dont cover the big picture.
I was wondering if any of you have similar experience and what has helped you? Was it a combination of medications or a different one altogether?
My Doc is on holidays and i wanted to use the time until then to better understand my situation. Thank you everyone! 🙌🏻";r/adhd_anxiety;1;0;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1jwug6j/medication_for_adhd_anxiety/
2025-04-10 16:07:57;Advice :Potential diagnosing adhd with anxiety ??;"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out for some guidance and support.

I’ve been struggling for a while with anxiety and trauma rooted in my childhood, which I’ve been working through in therapy. Recently, my psychologist suggested I look into ADHD—something I had also been wondering about—and it really resonated with me.

Both of my siblings have ADHD (one is also autistic), and I recognize a lot of the same traits in myself. But I also have severe anxiety and trauma, and I’m scared those might be masking or mimicking ADHD symptoms. It’s hard to know what’s what.

My sister, who’s studying medicine and has ADHD herself, told me it’s not worth getting assessed. She said the treatment would be similar anyway, that ADHD meds could worsen my anxiety, and that doctors might not take me seriously because of my anxiety diagnosis. While I respect her medical insight, it left me feeling invalidated and stuck. I can’t help but feel like there might be some bias there—like she doesn’t fully want to accept that I could have my own struggles.

I just want to understand myself better. I feel like something is wrong with me, and I’m not living up to my potential. Right now, I’m just stuck—wasting time and feeling frustrated with myself. Therapy has been helpful, but it’s expensive and often inconsistent due to uni scheduling, and I’m feeling really alone in all of this.

If anyone has had a similar experience—especially with anxiety or trauma making ADHD harder to diagnose—did you end up going through with an assessment? Did it give you clarity or help with your treatment? Was it worth it? What was your evaluation like? What evidence did you provide??

Thank you so much for reading. I really appreciate any insight or experiences you’re open to sharing.

2025-04-10 02:11:03;Adderall Rage!;"
So recently was diagnosed with adhd and never taken any type of stimulant before. However my previous provider had me on Wellbutrin and that was a hot mess! That made me so forgetful i honestly thought i was developing dementia, anyway adderall has been okay, the two positives I’ve taken from it are no appetite and more focus however the cons outweigh the pros. I can’t explain how angry i am on this stuff, so concerning!!! I feel so bad for my hubby because my patience is NONEXISTENT! Mind you i am a mom as well. I guess my question is.. is anyone else this angry?! I had to stop it completely i think I’m done trying meds at this point, I’m so over this I can’t deal with the side effects and not to mention the prior authorization all meds require now smh! Insurance is not cooperating anyway lol i want to know if I’m alone here because idk what else to do! HELP";r/adhd_anxiety;14;26;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1jvckkv/adderall_rage/
2025-04-09 10:29:07;Silence…That’s how I knew the medicine was working.;"So I’ve had undiagnosed ADHD since childhood. When I was growing up it wasn’t a thing 32(m). I always felt different and could never just fit in. Always tired and just kinda surviving. Nothing excited me and just felt completely empty. I had to just focus as hard as I could on one thing of enjoyment to get me through the day. It was innocent at first, was a huge wrestling fan as a kid so Raw and Smackdown was where I’d get my dopamine fix. Of course as I got older I stopped watching and it was video games then into young adulthood alcohol. That’s what stopped my rapid thinking so I abused it. I drank everyday for 10 years. After a few years it wasn’t fun anymore just habit. Everything started falling apart my health, money, work ethic. I just walked around tired and hungover. It strained my marriage greatly. I had a wake up call early 

January of this year. Sitting in an emergency room lobby at 2am. I had lacerated my elbow while heavily intoxicated and lost a lot of blood. My son witnessed everything. Very traumatic for him. As I waited on a ride to pick me up after having my elbow stapled I could feel the look on peoples face of disgust. I felt dirty lower than low. As I sobered up I realized I hated alcohol. It was never my friend, it brought out the worst of me. I liked that side at one point confident, focused, made me feel I could conquer whatever task. It was silence. I eventually sobered up and realized that can never happen again. It was hard! I went cold turkey and went through major withdrawals. Ended up doing 1 day, 1 week, 1 month by telling myself you made it yesterday why not today? Therapy was a key vital to all of this, helped me understand I was self medicating. After months of trying different medications I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall. Started it on Sunday 20mg IR 2x a day. I kept thinking it’s not working 


I don’t feel amped up full of energy. It’s a bad batch etc. went down a huge rabbit hole that I was getting less effective medicine because of the manufacturer and it being generic. I kept saying I feel tired, slow to hit these tasks then expected. As I drove home today I sat there…no racing thoughts or constant worrying. I typically always feel on edge but yet I was calm and very clear minded. Just silence. That’s when I realized the medicine is working.

2025-04-07 04:57:23;How do you deal with RSD?;"I’m 21M, diagnosed and medicated. I live with my SO who is 22F. When it comes to our relationship, we’re pretty much complete opposites of each other. RSD has been a huge problem in our relationship on my end. We used to live apart, and it was heightened at that time. After getting diagnosed, medicated, and moving in together, it got better. However, sometimes it’s harder than others. Today is one of those days. She was out all day yesterday and has been out for most of the day today too. My parents invited us to go eat dinner with them later today, and I asked her if she could come. She said no since she was planning on eating dinner with her friends. I communicated with her that I’d really like it if she comes along because she’s been out the entire weekend and it would be nice to spend time with her and my family. She left my message on read, and I know I can’t control her decisions, I’m here asking how you’re able to deal with the RSD effectively? I know progress isn’t linear, I just want to see if anyone else has advice on how to deal with it.

I'm currently on week 2 of my adhd diagnosis and I'm on:
-10mg adderall XR 
-20mg fluoxitine 2x a day
-20mg of hydroxizine 2x a day
 My adhd was diagnosed from being very hyperfocused and alot of my doctors before my diagnosis said this was anxiety and depression.
Most people would calm this ""health anxiety"" I'm very very hyperfocused on my health especially terminal illnesses I think i have them..
I got blood work done and head scans and ecg to check my heart and my doctor said everything is great.
I feel extreme fatigue, lile to the point where it's almost to much to type this out and it scares me like I was in the store and felt like I needed to get out of there cause I was gonna pass out or something..
I still play baseball and I'm preety active but it sure seems to effect these things cpuld this be an imbalance or is it from me trying to figure out my adhd meds..... IDK...
I also chew tobacco and i don't think the nicotine helps my case 1 bit but maybe it beneficial, just looking to see if anyone else has these symptoms and how I can approach this and not feel alone

2025-04-03 08:25:23;Any ADHD Academic failure turned into success(college students) ?;"Hey y’all, I’m making this post because I am feeling defeated. Since 2020 I have been taking classes at my local community college in hopes of getting an associates and transferring there have been a few semesters where I’ve done alright got at least a 3.0 but there have also been semesters where I failed every single class and had to take them again and then failed again. I should mentioned that I was undiagnosed up until about a month ago, I’m now a 23 year old female and still in community college with about five classes to go before I can transfer. I’ve had to switch my major three times and I’ve truly struggled. Eventually this time last year. I decided that I was sick of continuously, failing and feeling humiliated. This has been a secret I’ve kept from everyone close to me. The only people that know are the people that can see my transcripts for example my counselor. Now that I’ve been formally diagnosed after a lengthy process of begging for help and accommodations time and time again, I have received accommodations. I was put on Adderall a couple weeks ago and the future seems brighter to me. I’m just not sure if my transcripts will allow for me to get into schools of my choice because of all the f’s on my transcript. My dream schools are USC, UCLA, Pepperdine, Uc San Diego. 

I am very intelligent, but I struggle with ADHD paralysis and perfectionism. Previously before being diagnosed, I would procrastinate very often. I’d open my computer to do schoolwork and not be able to get anything done for hours just staring at the screen. I also felt that if I couldn’t do something perfect and I shouldn’t do it at all or turn it in. It makes me sad that this was overlooked, in my younger years, although I should note that I was experiencing homelessness with my family as a child, so long as I presented as intelligent and spoke well, could hyper focus, my parents neglected to have me diagnosed. I think they felt a sense of shame because people see me as intelligent. They’d brag about this telling others that I am very smart but when my report cards would sometimes come back I’d have a few bad grades which didn’t translate to how I presented. This has created a lot of shame for me. Especially since they would rarely acknowledge the bad grades and only the praise.

Has anyone had a similar experience with trying to get into the UCs? Private schools? I’m looking for some success stories because I feel discouraged. I’m getting my GPA back up, but I don’t know how to explain the amount of failed classes that I’ve taken. I may be able to get some excused withdrawals, but I’m honestly not sure. 


This has been my biggest nightmare, but slowly and surely I am crawling out of this dark hole trying to change for the better. Sometimes I wonder why I didn’t give up but I’m very stubborn in that way and I don’t take no for an answer, especially from myself. Getting my bachelors degree is something that I will do and it has been hard, but I believe in myself.

Please offer any advice that you may have that can help me while applying to the schools or some verbiage about your experience.

2025-04-03 02:09:21;Currently on adderall, want to start medication for my anxiety also. Should I wait til I can get a more thorough assessment, or have my family doctor prescribe something?;"Hello friends, after much probing, my doctor finally took me seriously and gave me an anxiety diagnosis. During that visit (about a year and a half ago), he had said that we could look into medication as a treatment option. I'm at a place in my life right now where I desperately need relief from these symptoms, so I've finally decided to go ahead with it.

What is making me hesitant, however, is that my doc had said GAD, and I'm suspecting that it's actually something else (OCD). When I saw him, I was expecting a longer and more thorough assessment, but the procedure seemed really brief and informal; he just listened to me tell him about my experience, and then at the end of it, said something like, ""So it sounds like you have something called generalized anxiety disorder ..."" lol. And I realise that interviews are a valid diagnostic method, but I think I was expecting to at least fill out like a questionnaire or something. It just leaves me wondering whether he got the full picture.

My concern here is starting medication that is not right for me in the case that I am misdiagnosed. If there is a treatment out there that we know to be most effective for whatever it is that I specifically have, then I want to make sure we know exactly what I have with the highest accuracy possible. I'm worried about wasting time trying something that gives me lackluster results, or worse, introduces some new problems. :(

So my question now is: Should I go ahead and accept the avenue that my doc is suggesting, under the assumption that I have GAD? Or is it worth sharing the concerns above, asking if he can refer me to someone more specialized, and waiting a little longer (possibly a *lot* longer..?) to potentially receive more fine-tuned treatment?

Some more context:

* I'm in Ontario
* I'm feeling lukewarm about the adderall... I don't know if it's giving me the benefits it's supposed to, so I've already been considering trying something different. This is why I'm especially concerned about my future treatment being an ill fit...

If you are like me and received an anxiety diagnosis following ADHD, I'd love to hear your experiences in finding the right cocktail of medication. Thank you hugely in advance for any advice. 💜

**Update:** Big thank you to everyone who responded. I asked my doc to refer me to a psychiatrist for a second opinion and he did. 😊 It's a two-to-three-month wait to see them lol, but oh well. I'm happy that the wheels are in motion.";r/adhd_anxiety;9;14;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1jpvguo/currently_on_adderall_want_to_start_medication/
2025-04-02 23:20:09;Getting your brain to shift into higher gears without exacerbating anxiety?;"Hey all! Long time listener, first time caller. I’m starting with a new psychiatrist and have a therapist, but I’m at a point where I don’t know where to go with treatment and am looking for some advice to create some suggestions for my providers. 

Ultimately I’m trying to find a way to get my brain to shift into “able to critically think and concentrate” mode without exacerbating my existing anxiety. 

I’m diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and GAD. Currently I’ve hit the reset button and am off everything. Previous treatment has been along the lines of the following (not chronological order): 

SNRI + stimulant 

SNRI + Wellbutrin + stimulant

SNRI + Wellbutrin 

SNRI + Intuniv

SNRI + Lamictal + Wellbutrin

Lamictal + Wellbutrin

Wellbutrin

Clonidine at night + stim in the morning 


It seems like I don’t respond well to stims. It’s like things jump from fatigue to increased anxiety with fatigue lol. I feel like how cartoon characters are drawn when they drink coffee; my outline is squiggly with energy but it’s not going anywhere. SNRIs also tended to exacerbate anxiety. I’ve had sleep issues as well, but have tested negative for sleep apnea. 

Symptoms I deal with are along the lines of: fatigue, feeling anxious and worried, lack of mental endurance/emotional capacity, paralysis by analysis, unable to focus enough to read well or write well (like I have to comb through an email multiple times), feeling dumb, lacking confidence, bouncing between things without finishing them, lack of awareness, and a general disinterest in things I used to like, and lack of dreaming/deep sleep.

2025-04-02 15:41:31;15mg buspar 20mg vyvanse;"hi all, late diagnosed adhd 22yo female here. currently on 10mg buspar, 18mg concerta, but wasn’t completely happy with the constant body anxiety i was having/uncomfortably high heart rate/chest pain. my dr just prescribed me 15mg buspar and 20mg vyvanse. 

ive tried adderall and ritalin in the past, but stopped after the Great Shortage in my area and only got back into medication when i developed a panic disorder in january (stems from health anxiety, ie feeling too much of my body at all times lol). i got cleared by my cardiologist which helped with the whole “my heart is going to explode out of my chest” thing, and i know vyvanse is still a stim, but im hoping it’ll react better than concerta?

curious about others’ experiences on this combo, as my therapist suggested it since it might be a little gentler on my body and hopefully work better on my anxiety and adhd? concerta didn’t do much for my focus, but right now im just hoping it takes away the anxiety since it makes it really difficult to function. OH, also! anyone lactose intolerant with buspar and do anything to remedy the lactose affects of the meds? i find it super difficult to eat, not bc of the appetite suppressant effects, but bc i feel constantly bloated while taking the meds lmao

low doses right now and hope not to have to increase much, as i had serotonin syndrome from 150mg prozac 300mg wellbutrin combo prior to my adhd diagnosis, and nervous to go too high </3

TLDR, starting on 15mg buspar, 20mg vyvanse and would like to know others’ experiences on this combo. ";r/adhd_anxiety;3;2;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1jpj3ml/15mg_buspar_20mg_vyvanse/

2025-03-31 16:49:14;Living with impaired memory, no emotions, and a blank mind - desperate for help;"I recently wrote about my cognitive experience in full to try and make sense of things: [https://open.substack.com/pub/dymphna444/p/living-with-no-memory-no-emotions](https://open.substack.com/pub/dymphna444/p/living-with-no-memory-no-emotions)

It's too long for Reddit, but I'd appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and can offer help.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety, but what's truly devastating is the combination of three interconnected challenges:

1. **Poor memory**: Severely impaired across all types - short term, long term, working memory, and especially recall (cued recall works slightly better). Information doesn't seem to properly encode in the first place, my life feels like a camera that isn't recording anything.
2. **Lack of emotions**: Complete emotional numbness, very unreactive no feelings whatsoever.
3. **Blank mind**: No spontaneous thoughts, automatic associations, opinions, and struggle to think on the spot. Can’t problem-solve real-time situations.

This has been lifelong but has really caught up with me in my 20s (I’m 26). The implications are devastating - extreme alienation, no sense of self or continuity, inability to build on past experiences, can't sustain relationships, constant anxiety and dissociation. Nothing feels real or important, and I never know what to do with myself. I'm quite suicidal and desperate because of this.

My social functioning is severely impacted. I can't hold basic conversations, connect with people, or maintain relationships. I've developed seriously avoidant behaviors and isolation as a result.

I'm currently trying therapy, medication (including treatments for anxiety and ADHD that don't address these core issues), and various lifestyle changes. I exercise regularly, maintain a healthy diet, and practice meditation.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone here has experienced similar symptoms beyond typical ADHD/anxiety. I'm looking for specialized treatment approaches, relevant research, or professionals who understand these specific cognitive issues.

Has anyone here found relief or improvement for similar symptoms? Any perspective would be deeply appreciated.";r/adhd_anxiety;4;6;https://reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1jnypam/living_with_impaired_memory_no_emotions_and_a/

2025-01-25 22:51:48;You're going to shoot yourself in the foot if you don't put up a barrier between yourself and society's discourse on ADHD.;"**ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition present from birth.** It is a lifelong condition, and the best treatments are medication combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy.

**One of the key issues with ADHD is the following:** In the brains of individuals with ADHD, an anomaly in the dopaminergic system is observed. Specifically, when dopamine is released, it is reabsorbed too quickly by neurons through a process called synaptic reuptake. This means that dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, focus, and behavioral regulation, remains active in neural circuits for a shorter period of time.

This deficiency leads to difficulties in staying motivated to complete tasks, planning, maintaining focus, or executing complex steps. It is not a matter of willpower or discipline but a direct consequence of the brain's structure and functioning in ADHD.

**The only way to directly and structurally address this dopamine issue is through medication.** 

Taking medication has saved the lives of many people with ADHD. Many people document how they see their lives as “before” and “after” medication, because the change is so drastic. Yes, there are some side effects, but they are almost never as harmful as living without treatment.

**Despite the effectiveness of medication and the positive impact it has on people's lives, uninformed individuals continue to denigrate these treatments.** Why?

1. **Toxic Positivity:** ""ADHD is not a disorder! They just want to medicate people to control them!"" ⇒ Of course, living on average 13 fewer years than others clearly shows that ADHD isn’t a serious, empirically documented issue. ADHD is not comparable to simple personality traits. My personality is not my disorder. I am someone; my ADHD is something else. Who I am is not the problem—my ADHD is. Adopting this perspective means you deny the truth and unintentionally reduce people to their condition.
2. **False Belief:** ""Adult ADHD doesn’t exist."" ⇒ Yes, of course, your brain structure magically rearranges itself once you turn 18, even though you’ve been this way since birth. Just like you stop being autistic as an adult because only children can be autistic.
3. **Downplaying Severity:** ""ADHD can be managed with willpower and discipline."" ⇒ Oh sure, I can totally control the behavior of my neurotransmitters with my willpower and discipline. Systems and habits work when combined with treatment because allowing dopamine to circulate properly enables individuals to adopt healthy behaviors. Without treatment, the individual simply won’t follow through. Why? Because their brain fundamentally prevents them from doing so.
4. **Minimization:** ""Everyone has ADHD (sometimes they add “nowadays”)."" ⇒ What distinguishes normality from pathology is **intensity**. Everyone has an imagination—not everyone has psychosis. Everyone feels sad sometimes—not everyone is depressed. Everyone experiences stress—not everyone has generalized anxiety disorder. Similarly, while everyone might have trouble concentrating, procrastinate, or forget things occasionally, not everyone has their life derailed because these issues persist regardless of their efforts.
5. **Irrational Fear of Medication:** ""It’s just Big Pharma trying to make money off people."" ⇒ Right, just like they make money selling aspirin, insulin, acetaminophen, acne treatments, and so on. Pharmaceutical companies sell medication, and those who need it buy it. Is there corruption? Yes, as in any industry. However, I’d be curious to know how you’ve concluded that ADHD treatments specifically are a scam, despite extensive research proving otherwise.
6. **Blaming Modernity:** ""Everyone develops ADHD because of screens and TikTok."" ⇒ According to this thesis, people are born with a ""normal"" brain, but technology rewires their brain to resemble that of someone with ADHD. This assumes ADHD is something you “develop” during life rather than being born with, which research has proven false. Of course, screens and social media negatively affect focus and productivity, but unlike ADHD, doing a “dopamine detox” can actually help combat these effects because the problem isn’t structural.
7. **Alternative Solutions:** ""ADHD can be managed with a proper lifestyle, including a good diet and exercise."" ⇒ A good lifestyle benefits everyone—it is not a cure for ADHD. Sure, it can reduce symptom severity, but all else being equal, an individual with ADHD and a perfect lifestyle will still struggle more with focus than a someone else with an average lifestyle. Once again, the issue is structural.
8. **""ADHD is due to trauma.""** ⇒ ADHD doesn’t emerge after trauma, but having ADHD can certainly traumatize a child. Growing up being told you’re stupid and being asked to explain behaviors you can’t understand yourself is, indeed, traumatizing.

**The people who spread such ideas generally fall into the following categories:**

* **Uninformed individuals** who’ve never read a single academic article on the subject.
* **People with ADHD** who’ve internalized society’s guilt-laden narratives about productivity and “willpower,” or who simply don’t accept what they’re experiencing.
* **Businesspeople** selling “magic” solutions.

**Ultimately, the contempt for this condition (and not others) stems from a modern obsession with productivity.**

**Let me highlight the fundamental hypocrisy society shows toward people with ADHD:**

**Scenario 1:**

* Society says people with ADHD must be productive.
* Therefore, the person with ADHD takes their medication to be productive.
* However, society shames them for taking medication to be productive.

**Scenario 2:**

* The person with ADHD does not take their medication.
* Therefore, they are not productive.
* Society shames and belittles them for being unproductive.

Thus, people with ADHD are always at a loss. If they don’t take their medication and their symptoms manifest, they are unproductive and have no value to the system. If they do take their medication to be productive, regardless of its effectiveness, they’re in the wrong because they’re a “drug addict” enslaved by Big Pharma with a “fake” condition.

**To please society, the following narrative would have to materialize:** ""I was diagnosed with ADHD by my psychiatrist, but I said screw it because ADHD is a fake condition and Big Pharma is trying to control me, so I cured my ADHD with the power of my will and discipline!"". This narrative would guarantee applause from everyone.

**My point is the following:** As someone with ADHD, it is impossible to satisfy society because the scenario described above is unrealistic for the overwhelming majority of people with ADHD. For most individuals with ADHD, the only way to meet society’s standards is simply **not to exist**, because whether we take our treatment or not, we are always at fault. Putting up a barrier is necessary.

I, too, used to think ADHD could be resolved with willpower and discipline. That’s why I tried going off my medication for several months. I was part of that second category of people.

I was quickly reminded of the truth: I have a neurodevelopmental disorder, and I was depriving myself of a normal life by refusing to take my medication—not because of the treatment itself, but because of others’ opinions about **my treatment** for **my condition**!

**If a treatment exists and it helps you, take it. Do not feel guilty for wanting to live a normal life. You have the right to do so.**

**And never forget to be extremely selective about the fucks you give.**";r/adhdwomen;3386;272;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i9ojp5/youre_going_to_shoot_yourself_in_the_foot_if_you/
2025-01-22 02:20:33;ADHD High IQ Finally realized why I am always exhausted.;"41m. ADHD Inattentive type with high IQ. I finally realized why I am always exhausted.

I manage to be a decently functioning adult.  I am divorced, but I am a good dad and have been dating a woman my kids like for 3+ years (I like her too!).  My house is typically  messy, but I do own a modest house. I struggle sometimes at work, but make above average the median wage and have had the same job for 7 years. I don't have a emergency fund, but I have good credit and contribute to a retirment fund pretty regularly. You get the idea. Things are clearly ok, but things could clearly be better in lots of ways.

But there is also this: I am almost always exhausted. Like bone tired level of exhaustion comes up most days. I first remember this coming up in college. Sometimes I'm also dizzy from exhaustion. Hydration and exercise help some, but not completely.

Here is what I realized.

My processing speed and working memory suck--not official terms, but the same testing during my diagnosis that showed high IQ also showed low processing speed and working memory. But high IQ can solve a lot of problems. So it seems like I've routed my daily tasks through my intellect rather than through the habit building that working memory and processing speed seem to allow. Like when I put laundry away, I have to actually think about how to put laundry away.  When I clean the house, I have to actively think about how to do it.  There are very few daily processes that genuinely just become habit--I have to really think about all of them to make them happen.

2025-01-08 23:11:42;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms worsen right before and during a period, a new study finds;"Snippet from [the story](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/adhd-symptoms-can-fluctuate-with-the-menstrual-cycle/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit):

Michelle Martel, a clinical psychologist and chair of the psychology department at the University of Kentucky, led the new research, which followed 97 female college students across their menstrual cycle. Nearly all participants had a formal ADHD diagnosis, and roughly half took psychostimulants for treatment. Every day, Martel’s team measured participants’ hormone levels and assessed their ADHD symptoms with questionnaires and cognitive tests.

Martel and her colleagues found that participants reported worse ADHD symptoms, such as inattention and impulsivity, just before and at the start of their period and, to a lesser extent, around ovulation. This aligned with the results of cognitive tasks, and it also echoes what many psychologists, including Martel and Wynchank, have already heard from their patients.

2024-12-16 10:05:27;My son's ADHD saved his sister's life;"My son was only 7 years old when he took a picture of his little sister on his new tablet. He noticed something. One eye was red, one eye was white? He has always hyper fixated on patterns, or differences in things. This has had its ups and downs. He will ask larger people why they are fat (at 5.5 years old- sorry nurse at the ER at some hospital in Flint, MI) or point out someone's physical disability. He means well, he is just fascinated and curious. He has an IEP at school and has a ""combined"" ADHD diagnosis, a ""learning disability"" and ""other trauma and stressor related"" disorder.

My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma ( rare form of pediatric eye cancer) because of this picture, alone. She had her 3 year well child visit less than 2 months prior to her diagnosis.

She had an enucleation, and having told the surgeon and eye specialist the story of why she was diagnosed, she said to tell my 7 year old son he saved his little sister's life. She was in tears when she told me the tumor was a mere 1-2 mm ( THATS MILLIMETERS Y'ALL) from spreading to her brain via her optic nerve. 6 rounds of chemo and she has made one heck of a recovery. She did lose her hair, her right eye and she does struggle in school a bit. Chemo has some nasty side effects, even years down the road from treatment. She doesn't remember having two eyes. As sad as it is, it's worked in her favor.

She is now 6 years old, and in 1st grade. Her brother still has his little sister, and he is my super hero, forever!!  

EDIT/ADDED AFTER- Wow I am so shocked by the attention this has gotten. YES my son absolutely saved his little sister. I have never once said it was his ADHD that saved her. Honestly, it was just a catchy title. Thank you so much for your kind words, and concern that my son may have been misdiagnosed. I promise you all, he is very loved, and no one on this earth cares more about his health and well being. That being said, I don't think him having any other diagnosis would result in any difference in his treatment plan. He has multiple Drs who reassure me that I am taking all of the correct steps, and that additional testing is not necessary, as of right now. I will continue to advocate for all of my children, and I hope this made your day when you read it :) thanks again.

2024-11-30 13:38:35;Diagnosed on Monday at the age of 33. Met with my therapist yesterday. Made her cry.;"So, I was officially diagnosed on Monday with ADD, and the doctor prescribed Concerta for me. She said that if it worked, it would be like putting glasses on - suddenly, I’d be able to read, and things would be more in focus. But that analogy isn’t enough. It’s too small.

I saw my therapist on Friday, and she asked what it’s been like for the past four days being on medication. Do I think it’s working and what evidence do I have that it’s working.

The glasses analogy just isn’t enough. It’s not just like putting glasses on - it’s like putting glasses on, and someone also turned the lights on in the room. They turned off the strobe light, stopped blasting different kinds of music on six different stereos, made the marching band go away and got all the chaotic crazy rabid cats to sit down. And then, I can see that three of the cats weren’t even mine, and one was a raccoon.

Someone turned all the TVs off. They stopped flipping the room upside down all the time. I feel like I’ve been stuck in a maze my whole life - trying to catch these rabid cats - I knew where I was supposed to be going and how to get there, but someone kept moving all the walls. I’ve spent my whole life chasing my tail. And now, the maze is just… gone. It’s a level playing field. I can see what’s happening and what’s going on and what obstacles are coming.

Even small things have changed. I notice that I’m hungry before I’m starving to the point of passing out. I know I need to pee before I’m so desperate I have 30 seconds before I wet myself. I realize I’m a little thirsty and need a drink, instead of going an entire day without drinking anything and then having to chug two liters of water because I’m on the brink of dehydration.

Suddenly, I can just do these things—without getting distracted, without getting caught up in the maze and lost six times on side quests.

Being medicated for ADD is completely life-changing.

My therapist said she had never heard such a detailed, powerful, visual description of what it’s like when the medication works; that it must be totally exhausting to deal with all of that all of the time and no wonder I’m a ball of anxiety and have depression. No wonder I’m a total control freak and no wonder I can’t delegate things and let people help; I have no idea what’s going on! I’m constantly fighting a losing battle and so when I give up trying to control everything, I sink into a hopeless pit of despair because why bother? I never win - I never get anywhere no matter how hard I try. And she cried. And I cried.

2024-11-05 20:24:31;Children with higher IQ scores were diagnosed later with ADHD than those with lower scores. Children with higher cognitive abilities might be able to mask ADHD symptoms better, especially inattentive symptoms, which are less disruptive.;"A study was published in the [British Journal of Psychology](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12485). They've finally done a study on something I think a lot of us have suspected for a while. You're more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD later if you have high IQ. This doesn't surprise me at all to be honest.

I suspect the hierarchy for diagnosis, especially as a child is:

- Hyperactive/ disruptive regardless of intelligence 
- Inattentive with a parent who has it and knows the signs regardless of intelligence 
- Inattentive with average intelligence or less (may or may not be diagnosed as a child)
- Inattentive with high intelligence (unlikely to be diagnosed as a kid and perhaps at all)

2024-09-02 01:35:06;Is this a safe space to actually honestly talk about ADHD?;"Here is the thing :
1) Multiple coping mechanisms or mitigations exist. Medication is a valid one. There is also adaption. There are several things some people think help which are 

2) ADHD just is. It's unhelpful to think of it as ""bad"" or ""good"" without context. SOmething that is disabilitating in one context is sometimes helpful in another.  Some of the drama in the ADHD community amounts to people looking at different aspects of the same thing.  Ultimately, science will get deeper into the root causes and likely what is today called ADHD might well be identified as separate 

3) There is physical evidence for ADHD but the research is involving. I would like to be able to talk about research into the possibilty of imaging being used in diagnosis which is an evolving debate and an evolving research topic.

4) I don't want to be forced to put any peer reviewed ADHD researcher on a pedastil. One should be able to talk about research and of course it's acceptance within the research commmunity. Dr R Barkley and Dr D Amen for example both have peer reviewed papers. Dr Barkley researchers different areas and is looking more into current treatment. That said, the research of Dr Amen using SpECT is not approved clinical standard for diagnosis but it doesn't mean that research into this topic is dead. It's occurring. The typical conclusion by independent researchers is

LIke everyone else with ADHD， Ｉ　ｈａｄ　ｉｔ　ａｌｌ　ｍｙ　ｌｉｆｅ．　I should  be allowed to talk about some of the nuances and even wonder about research that's evolving without being censored by mindless bots.

5) when there is peer reviewed research suggesting that people with ADHD are more creative in certain ways but not others, I should be allowed to say so.  You have a study claiming we are more creative. it looks typically at idea generation or new ideas, or art work generation or story writing. You have a study claiming we aren't creative, it looks at our ability to solve IQ test problems that are creative

6) I should be allowed to share my personal experience without being policed or without someone asserting that my personal experience applies to everyone else or asserting that my personal experience is somehow private. If I try a med one day and say so, it shouldn't be policed.

ADHD falls under the guidelines for a disability, and as such you may qualify for this offer. You can get your pass online for a $10 processing fee, or for free at any National Parks ticket booth. You will need to provide proof of your disability, so either medical records, or a doctor’s note. 

I’ve heard anecdotal stories that sometimes you can just sign an affidavit at a ticket booth, or show your meds, too. I recently applied online and had my pass mailed within 2 weeks.

This is such a great opportunity to make use of. Personally, being in nature is the only time I’m mostly free of my symptoms, and I plan to basically live in National Parks this summer!

2023-11-19 09:32:01;Dopamine is not the pleasure chemical;"This is one of the revelations from my neuropsych college classes. I was surprised because I always heard about dopamine and pleasure.

But…

There isn’t a flood of dopamine when you feel good. All the articles that call it the “feel good” chemical are pulling from theories neuroscientists stopped believing in the 80s. If you had no dopamine receptors, you could still experience pleasure. 

So when you are scrolling, watching videos or having sex, these are not giving you “dopamine hits.”

What does dopamine do? One of the biggest theories is that it is related to motivation. People studied under an MRI showed higher levels of dopamine release when they expected an experience to be rewarding (not always pleasurable, but rewarding), even if the tasks weren’t rewarding. If true, what this means is that what you expect to be rewarding has more connection to dopamine than what is actually so. 


It’s not clear why stimulants like Ritalin and other stimulants improve concentration. It’s quite possible that it related to dopamine but it’s unclear what that relationship is. But, there is no certain evidence that people diagnosed with ADHD have less dopamine receptors than anyone else. People who are not diagnosed also have improved concentration on Ritalin.

2023-08-02 12:14:46;I am a Pharmacy Technician Who Was a Jerk to People Who Use Stimulants. For a Year and a Half, I’ve Been (am) One of You and I Want to Apologize.;"Not seeking empathy but wanting to offer empathy. 

Hey all, as I look at some posts, there are obviously a lot of questions regarding our medications that keep us functioning. I’ve also heard stories of pharmacy staff treating you awful. I was one of them that minimized your need, and have been unkind myself. 

It seems like some of these pharmacies you all have mentioned may have told you incorrect information, made things hard or have been completely rude to you. Perhaps, a conversation can be had and I can help answer questions. 

Unfortunately, because of the few, who make dispensing stimulant medication difficult, we all have to abide by these rules that seem arbitrary, and make getting our meds so difficult to say the least. These few have made pharmacies frustrated, and have given us who use them responsibly a bad reputation. It isn’t right, but is the truth. 

In honesty and transparency, pharmacies really hate doing anything with stimulant medications. Frankly, and unfortunately those of us that use these medications are looked at as an annoyance to many pharmacies. I fill all my other meds at my pharmacy, but I fill my Adderall elsewhere because I am scared of the stigma that would be associated with me because of those few that give folks like us (us as people using stimulants responsibly) a bad rap. It’s sad, but my reality. 

When I started as a technician, I fell into that toxic, judgmental and unfair attitude that exists in the pharmacy industry. Fast forward a year, and I get diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed Adderall. This stuff changed my life for the better, and I am grateful for it. So much so that I am tearing up writing this. I have now been medicated for a year and a half, and it has been the best times of my life. 

I am beyond remorseful for my attitudes and for the last two years. Since diagnosis I have tried every workaround, DUR codes, over rides and may even have committed insurance fraud a few times for those like us, who need these meds. I’ve spent countless hours on the phone with providers and insurance companies. I have gotten into yelling matches with many pharmacists.  I have not only sworn to help everyone who comes and asks me for help, but with special effort to those of us that  rely on these stimulants to give us our quality of life. 

Please not only take my deep and profound apologies for my ignorance and judgments,  but further, that ignorance and judgments the beautiful and noble practice of pharmacy has developed. There are wonderful caring people I promise. Just bad attitudes that come from the few that give us who use stimulants a bad name. It’s not fair but is what it is. 

I am hoping that this thread can be used to further the discussion between responsible stimulant users and and pharmacy. 

Please ask me anything. I hope I can be a pair of eyes and uncover what goes on behind the counter. If you don’t want to publish your question feel free to DM me. 

TL;DR I was a dick to ADHDers with stimulant meds when they came to my pharmacy, and now after using Adderall for a year and a half I’ve am one of you and want to apologize to the community and offer any answers I may have to offer. I hope you know, there are advocates for you behind the counter. 

I am NOT a pharmacist and cannot offer any council regarding the medical detail of medication.

2023-06-09 20:51:57;I’m noticing a tone change in our community that concerns me;"Hi y’all!  

In my experience, this sub has historically been such a lovely safe haven in comparison to the rest of reddit. A place where we can share openly, feel seen and supported without the fear of that hair-trigger downvoting and emotionally reactive commentary we are so used to in the rest of reddit and in our daily lives.  


Recently, I’ve been getting an uneasy feeling when I read some of our posts and comments. For instance: 


**1\. Unnecessary downvoting.** A recent example: One of our members posted about challenges in her relationship and was seeking advice from our community. Some were helping her see that the behaviors she described in her partner seem to align with abuse. She asked, “Do you think there’s any way he could be doing it unintentionally? I don’t think he realizes what he’s doing.” When I was in the thread, she had 26 downvotes for this. It was a genuine question, and one that is directly in line with the mentality of someone who has been in an abusive relationship. Why are we punishing her for this question? Also, downvoting is an RSD bombshell. Why pile on and downvote instead of moving past the post or comment and upvoting the sentiments we agree with?


**2\. Airing frustrations about the “Am I the only one?” posts, with lamentations about how we should search before posting.** I understand it can be annoying to see the same queries over and over (I get annoyed, too, sometimes.) At the same time, the reason people come here is to learn about and connect *their own* experiences to others. Rote searching and reading does not provide the connection to *our* experience - that “click” - that so many of us have been missing for so long. Also, frankly, our brand of neurodiversity has a tendency to fire things off without doing deep research.


**3\. Harsh directives seem to sometimes be taking the place of gentle and open questioning, consideration of the other’s point of view, and offering support.** We are a fabulous bunch, *and* we are also internet strangers - why not ask and consider vs. project our own experiences and judge/direct? Of course, this can fall into that behavior of firing things off impulsively that many of us can relate to. I just notice a tone that seems more…judgmental than I’m used to on this sub.


A gift many of us have is that we have gut feelings equivalent to emotion/tone Geiger counters. Any other Geigers going off? Also, is it beneficial for this sub to have a downvote option? Just a thought.  


Love y’all, and you’ve helped me so much through my understanding and accepting of my own late diagnosis. Hoping to keep this place wholly supportive so we can all continue to benefit from our collective wisdom.🩷

Anyway because there was only five of us older teens, we got put in games with this party of a bunch of 10 year olds and their parents. And there’s this one girl who just could not focus or sit still, and her dad was blushing real hard as he tried to get her to be quiet. 

Her dad apologised to the chick doing the rules and stuff after she had finished and explained that his kid had ADHD. 

(now what I did probably wasn’t the smartest move) I, also an ADHDer with no real filter, spun around and said “Same!” and gave the kid a high five. 

This kid. She just- beamed! Apparently she had gotten diagnosed only recently and hadn’t met any other people with it yet. Anyway, she started babbling, I of course continued the conversation, also babbling. 

I found out that she’s real into the avengers at the moment, and as a former marvel nerd, I threw some quick hit facts from my glory days. It was fun! 

We paired together in the pairs game, and came 3rd! Beat only by two of my friends and then a father and son duo. 

After the games had ended for the 10 year olds (us older teens had one more game left). and the party was packing up, the dad of the kid came over and thanked me.

I finally got my prescription for meds at the end of April, and I come back in early-mid May to check in on my meds. My psychiatrist adds, ""By the way, I see you've started scheduling that sleep study. Good. By the way, sleep apnea is a strong rule-out for ADHD and if you're detected with sleep apnea we're going to want you to suspend your medication for a week and just use a CPAP.""

NO.

ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'VE HAD IT. I've put up with five months of dilatory behavior from this clinic so far but this is where I'm drawing the line. I don't know why I stuck around when I was told TO MY FACE that if I hadn't had an ADHD diagnosis as a kid I wouldn't have even been allowed to start approaching treatment as an adult, but this is a step too far.

I don't know if it's the clinic or if it's *you*, but this apparent aggressive stance toward minimizing adult ADHD is crossing all kinds of lines. I DO NOT CONSENT to have a sleep study if it's going to jeopardize my ADHD diagnosis OR my medication. I will LEAVE the clinic if this horseshit continues to happen because it's making me reluctant to discuss ANY health issues, mental or physical, with the clinic for fear of having my diagnosis and my meds removed.

I cannot have a medical relationship with an organization that is displaying this level of BLATANT ableism. Either you fix your shit NOW, or I'm GONE.";r/ADHDers;97;22;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/13gvz5q/i_complained_and_i_feel_worse/
2023-05-08 11:38:04;I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share;"(Disclaimer: I am not any sort of recruiter and gain nothing financial from this posting. I’m just trying to share my experience in hopes that it can help someone like me.)

I’m a 27yo female diagnosed with ADHD and started medication in 2021. I showed a ton of signs of ADHD as a child but was never diagnosed because I was good at masking/coping, but that’s a story for a different post.

I was previously a teacher and did some social work. I loved the job but like my symptoms were awful in that career because of the lack of daily closure and endless deadlines.

I will never stop talking about how perfect my career is for a brain like mine. And that career is radiologic technologist. If you don’t know what a rad tech is, they’re the people who take your x-rays, CTs, MRIs, and other medical imaging. 

Here’s why it’s perfect:

-All rad techs (except ultrasound) start in x-ray, which is what I do. When you get bored with x-ray, there are tons of opportunities to cross train in MRI, CT, IR, cath lab, vascular IR, mammography, and lots more. I love knowing that when I inevitably become tired of X-ray, I can easily change fields without having to change my place of work. And if I want to leave, I can work in a variety of environments.

-The instant gratification is incredible. There are no long term projects, no calendars full of deadlines, no long boring meetings. I x-ray a patient, get a small high when my images come out beautiful, I scan in like two papers, and then I send the patient on their merry way. If the patient is challenging, my brain is so happy to think outside the box and try different techniques to get things just perfect.

-The job is constantly on the go, which I LOVE! 

-School is only two years and is very hands on. I struggle with lectures so this worked very well for me.

-And best of all, no one judges me when I pound down my Ritalin with a Celsius because they’re all doing the same thing!

I really hope this helps somebody!☺️

EDIT: Wow, I did not anticipate to wake up with this much attention to this post! I wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions that I’m seeing over and over:

1. EDUCATION: A degree in X-ray which is where the majority of people start, is an Associate’s degree. I did the program in 20 months, which included a summer, and took most of my general education credits simultaneously. Several people in my graduating class did the program in three years so their gen eds were done ahead of time. There are Bachelors degrees but they’re not required. Some schools also offer 2+1 programs where you can graduate having done X-ray plus a modality. These are cool if you want to fast track yourself into a modality such as MRI or CT! While some modalities require a formal education, where I live most places will train the ones that don’t right on the job. I encourage those interested in a specific area to go to ARRT.org

2. THE SCHOOLING IS NO JOKE: Although school is short, it’s not for the faint of heart. You do clinicals along with didactic courses, and then at the end, you have to take and pass a massive board exam to get a license. The time those things take are a big commitment. I was really passionate about it all so it wasn’t as hard for me as it was for others!

3. SCHOOLING CAN BE FREE: I didn’t pay a penny to go back to school because I applied for every scholarship and every grant my community college offered. Hospitals need imaging professionals now more than ever so I know many hospitals are sponsoring students to go or offering massive amounts loan forgiveness.

4. PAY: I have a hard time answering questions about pay because it is so variable depending on if you work in a hospital or outpatient setting, if you take call, if you work a shift with high premiums, etc. Most of all, it totally depend on what state you’re in! X-ray techs generally are paid the lowest, but if you can work somewhere that cross trains in other modalities, you can make a lot more. My MRI friends have base pays higher than the staff nurses at the hospital. 

5. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH STOMACH: We see just as much as nurses/doctors if not more. Although I don’t generally have to clean patients, I do see open wounds and all of the bodily fluids. You also have to go to the OR during your schooling but you can find jobs that don’t require you to go to the OR. I have many friends in outpatient and they don’t deal with like any bodily fluids or super gross and sickly patients, but you do have to rotate through hospitals during school.

6. AN ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE IS A MUST: I have a very high level of empathy like many of us ADHDers do. At first, it was hard. A patient comes in for a scan worried their cancer has returned, and you do the scan and see that it has. We don’t diagnose so we can’t tell the patient, we just have to smile and go back in and talk to the patient. When I started, this sucked. But I direct my empathy towards taking care of their immediate needs like getting them a warm blanket or being a listening ear, and don’t really focus on the bad stuff. It happens to every healthcare worker with time. Every once in a while I get a sweet patient with a horrible prognosis and after they leave, I shed a few tears, I’m human. But I am always satisfied that in my short time with them, I helped them feel more comfortable and heard and cared for, and that’s all that matters.

7. IM IN THE UNITED STATES: Other countries require more education. Like nursing though, the US has radiology travelers too! They make really good money and generally only need a year of experience!

8. WORK/LIFE BALANCE AND STRESS: I left teaching because of how unhealthy my work/life balance was. I love my job now because I clock in, do my job, and leave. The only thing I ever have to do outside of work is continuing education credits to maintain my license, which are not hard or very tedious and are only required every other year. The job can be stressful day in and day out if it’s busy or there are hard patients, but that stress is very short term. I clock out and forget about it, and the next day is a new day!!

2023-04-29 17:50:29;Shout out to the parents in the late 90’s & 2000’s who despite being judged harshly by society, saw their child struggling & took them to get a diagnosis & help for their ADHD.;"I remember being in my teens sometime around ‘99, listening to my mum shit talking with other mums about kids in my school being given ADHD medication. They were saying ‘Oh it’s because the parents don’t discipline them enough’ and ‘They never should have been parents if they couldn’t handle their kids’. I also worked at a pharmacy in the early to mid 2000’s & witnessed the judgement from adult staff after they handed over ADHD medication, saying shit like ‘Must be a single mum who dopes up her kids instead of doing her job’ & ‘They need to be smacked more not given pills’.

I am not even being hyperbolic here. In Australia during that time (and beyond), that seemed to be the general consensus. Kids diagnosed with ADHD were just assholes who needed to be hit more. It certainly was my parent’s opinion especially while I was suffering through my teen years depressed, anxious and completely burnt out. Even when I finally went and got my own diagnosis at 37 years old, my mum was enraged when I posted about it on social media thinking she would be judged.

Not presuming these parents were all perfect & the kids didn’t still struggle. But they are still deserving of acknowledgement that during a time where they would have faced harsh judgement, still decided to get their kids help instead of just trying to beat the neurological disorder out of them instead.";r/ADHD;5656;376;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/132oq8r/shout_out_to_the_parents_in_the_late_90s_2000s/

It just took everything out of me and no matter how much hard i push myself or scold my self or even lie low in hopes that may be rest might kickstart me, I am unable to do even basic chores around my house. 
Not only that, I have recently been diagnosed with diabetes as well. I need to loose some weight and I have gym membership too but nope I am doing zilch. The constant fear that I will end up making my condition worse is scaring me but I don't see things improving much. Hubby is going overboard to help me. He cooks and picks up all the slack alone on top of his very very fucked up job. And I end up feeling even more guilty. He says sometimes this happens. Just ride it out it will get better. We both been diagnosed with PTSD and we believe we have ADHD as well, but for that the therapist we went to said to us that every IT person has adhd  and ignored it.
So yeah, that's where I am at.

2023-02-14 01:56:52;"the ""trend"" of adhd makes me insecure of my own diagnosis";"I love that there are more people coming forward about their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed for adhd. it's amazing that there's a lot of light shed on adhd now, and now there's people finally getting the help they need.

what I don't like is the sheer amount of people faking they have it for the ""quirkiness"" aspect of it. I thought this was just a thing where it was a small minority of people on the internet faking it for attention. Apparently, it's worse than that. 

I recently got my younger brother, who just started high school to get a diagnosis as well. since my diagnosis, I realized he was very similar to how I am and got him to see a specialist. I didn't want him to go through what I did at that age. he got diagnosed with adhd a couple of months ago. the diagnosis helped him immensely, and the accommodations he received got his grades to skyrocket.

recently, his new semester started, and when he went to a teacher to tell him about his adhd, the teacher straight up didn't believe him. told my brother that there have been at least 10 students that year that have faked adhd to get away with shit. that it was ""obvious,"" my brother was faking it. we had to get the principle involved because even the doctors note wasn't convincing the teacher.

my brother also told me that it was hard for him to tell others because he was scared nobody would believe him, because ""everyone has adhd these days"". I have to say, I've also been afraid of telling people I know about my adhd as well over the same fear. I'm so unbelievably angry for my brother. he's finally thriving in school, and now he's insecure because of this. 

don't people realize how much adhd can ruin someone's life? it made my life so freaking difficult. I have so many regrets. I had so much potential in so many things, but I couldn't try and live up to that potential because of this. I've fallen into a terrible depression because of the position I'm currently in because of my late diagnosis.

adhd isn't cute. it's not fun.

I’ve been dodging in person lectures, specifically for this course, because of my anxiety building up around public speech setting of the course.

As a result, i was not prepared at all, as a result, I failed the final. He told me that I failed right after the 20 minute ended, and my heart dropped.

Then he started to ask me if there’s something going on in my life, etc. I explained how I’ve been missing classes & my recent diagnosis of ADHD/Anxiety and not having any support system or family, he was empathetic enough to disregard my current failed grade.

He also told me that he has anxiety himself, and he’d be able to coach me with dealing with speaking skills when you have anxiety, if I want. 

He’s also letting me re-do my final after my other finals would be finished, and tutor me for what i’ve missed. At this point I started crying. I’m unsure if this was because of pure embarrassment or because i haven’t felt like I deserve this level of support from anyone.

2022-10-28 08:31:31;I just found out I don't have ADHD/ADD and want to die.;"I know it might sound really dramatic but let me explain. All my life I've felt that I'm stupid. That I don't understand stuff like other people do. All my life I've felt like there's something wrong with my brain. And I've hated myself for it. All my life. I had to get mentors and tutoring and did summer school.. I just had a really hard time in school. Doing my homework literally took 4h when other could do it in 30 minutes. 

Now as an adult I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation. I think I've actually struggled with that all my life because I have hated myself for my incompetence. My teachers and parents always told me that I need to ""try harder"" but I actually did. I put more effort into anything I did because for me it took way more effort and time. I've always felt similar to people with ADD and my friends from childhood have it were positive that I had it. 

Anyway, back to the diagnosis.. Today my mother vas interviewed and me as well. She was confident I don't have ADD or ADHD she just feels like I view things differently. She thinks I just have a different way of understanding things. I read the results today and I found out I don't have ADD nor ADHD. And my whole world has fallen apart. I was already talking with my doctors about starting medication. I was so excited to turn my miserable and unfocused life around. I guess not. 

Now I'll never know what is wrong with me. I thought I finally did.. I want to end my life because I feel like this further proves that I'm just stupid and simple compared to others and I just desperately tried to explain it by claiming I have adhd..

2022-09-15 20:31:31;The severity of this condition into adulthood isn't talked about enough.;"People just think it's staring out a window when the teacher is giving a lecture- that it's zoning out occasionally and coming back. They romanticize it like it's some cutesy thing kids do because they're curious or bored.

ADHD ruins people's ability to perform well in life. It gets in the way of EVERYTHING. ADHD doesn't ""get better with age"" it just manifests itself differently, and oftentimes having to transition into an adult is harder on the individual. 

Those who were diagnosed late may have lived their whole lives up until that point thinking that they were lazy, broken, worthless and pathetic. People saw them as such. They were raised to think that of themselves. Deep rooted trauma due to untreated ADHD is REAL.

I'm 22 years old. My birthday present this year was my ADHD diagnosis. After two decades of struggling with this unknowingly, I finally have an answer to the question: ""Why am I like this?"". I finally have the next step into a better path for my health and wellbeing. 

For anyone who was diagnosed late: i see you. I understand. You are not alone. You are not worthless, you are not broken, you are not useless. Do not let the opinions of people in your past define how you see yourself today.

And for any self-diagnosed adults, or undiagnosed adults with suspicions: get an assessment. Trust me when I say, the answer might be expensive (depending on where you live) but the result is worth it. The relief you feel once your suspicions are confirmed is beyond validating. And doors open for treatment options afterwards.

Many people will be understanding upfront and throw it back in your face when it suits them.

This can be used as a way to undermine any point you try to bring to their attention, or cast doubt on whether you are even capable of making a coherent point “due to your condition”. 

De-stigmatization has come a long way since I was young, but it is still there. Unfortunately, many of us still have to hide/lie about naturally occurring conditions in order to be taken seriously.

2022-07-23 23:12:51;I might have saved my niece from sharing my fate last night;"At a family dinner last night, I was listening to my older sister-in-law asking my mom about how to deal with my niece’s studying problems and what my mom would do in the situation. I eavesdropped for long enough to realize that she was JUST describing ADHD. It’s a pretty safe call considering 4 of my 5 siblings are diagnosed and she’s shown every sign of it since she was born.

Anyways my niece is 9, she tested in the 97th-99th percentile last year depending on the subject, and my sister-in-law was lamenting how she doesn’t always put in her “best effort” when it comes to things like spelling homework. I had the exact same thing and my parents managed to entirely destroy my confidence by always criticizing that my low 90s on tests wasn’t “good enough” because I “could do better if I was trying my best”.

So I of course invited myself to the conversation and hopefully some stuff stuck. Big piece of advice was: Get her diagnosed. Then don’t be afraid of either therapy or medication because it’s better to have her develop correctly with it than struggle without because of stereotypes.

I laid out some basic tips like assigning daily tasks that she’s expected to finish and then not checking in through the day to make sure she’s working on it but rather praise her when she does it before last minute and only mention it if it DOESN’T get done, make the goal in studying for a specific amount time rather about completing it to a specific criteria so she can learn HOW to regulate herself for effective work instead of focusing on how much she gets done, and things like that.

BUT what I really tried to hammer in that I think stuck was: Nothing she learns in elementary school is more important than her development. The big things to watch out for are making sure she’s not being ostracized for talking to loud/too often/or talking over her friends constantly, making sure she grows up confident knowing that it’s ok to fail and to pick yourself up when you do, and learning just basic discipline in structure so she knows HOW to regulate herself to finishing tasks but also just making her bed and putting laundry away without the additional stress of “if i don’t do this, i will be in trouble.”

I have a mental illness, or learning disability, or disorder, whatever you wanna call it, and I am not able to do everything as easily as other people can. So why should I be trying to do exactly the same stuff? I can’t! 

okay I can set a reminder for myself to vacuum the house later but the problem isn’t always that I forget, the problem is the vacuuming. I can set so much time aside to do the dishes but the problem isn’t the time, it’s doing the dishes. so why do we still try to do everything that other people do when we have a diagnosed issue? Well, stop! 

if you struggle with bringing the vacuum all the way from the closet to the living room to vacuum, stop! Keep the vacuum in the living room, better yet, keep it plugged in if you’re able

if you struggle with doing dishes, absolutely nothing is stopping you from just using paper plates

if you struggle with bringing trash to the kitchen, just keep a giant trash can in every room  

if you struggle with putting clothes away after washing them, just don’t fucking put them away!! fold them straight out of the dryer and just keep all your clothes in baskets

if you physically cannot focus on homework while you’re at home, instead of trying to force yourself to focus, just go to a coffee shop or library if you can. even sitting in a different room can help

if the crusty toothpaste bottle grosses you out and that deters you from brushing, look up how to make little single use toothpaste pellets 

if you struggle with bringing a charger everywhere and your phone is always dead, just put chargers everywhere! I have one in my bedroom, car, living room, and bathroom

If you struggle with cooking or preparing food, just get pre prepared food! it took me a long time and a lot of rotten fruit before I finally started buying precut fruit and guess what? haven’t wasted any since. it feels like it’s more expensive but just think about all the food you’ve wasted because it wasn’t prepared and you couldn’t bring yourself to cook it      

if you have the luxury of being able to afford a housekeeper, or a roomba, or a weekly mealkit service use them!! I know it makes you feel guilty but that’s what those services are for!!! they’re there so you can use them! never feel guilty about taking advantage of a system that’s designed to help you! (easier said than done I know)

do you get it?

stop feeling bad about having to be different to cater to your disorder. YOU HAVE A DISORDER! YOU’RE ALLOWED TO BREAK “RULES.” if you had a physical disorder would you feel bad? hmm? if you were in a wheelchair would you feel bad every time you used the elevator? just because our disorder is not as apparent doesn’t mean you have to struggle in silence. these tips aren’t going to fix everything, but they will definitely make your life a little easier

2022-03-10 00:08:01;After years of procrastination, I visited a dermatologist for the first time in my life for my chronic dry skin. I requested a simple moisturising routine because ADHD. She said: Don't hide behind lazy excuses. You just have to decide to commit to routines, even if complex. It's all in your mind.;"I just wanted to vent about how surreal it felt to witness that some medical professionals do not have even a basic crossdisciplinary awareness about mental health issues. She was truly convinced that I was wilfully indolent and complacent and that I was just refusing to apply myself. Even though I had a 'legit' diagnosis from certified experts. 🤷🏾‍♀️

(After a shocked Pikachu moment I did emphatically stand my ground despite her chastising, but not everyone in my place should be expected to do that.)

Medical 'solutions' that refuse to account for relevant mental health conditions are not solutions at all!

Edit:
Thanks so much for all your words of support. 🌸🌸🌸

I read some comments that said it's all about willpower, discipline and forcing oneself into making good habits. That advice is alas not very useful, as many of us know from frustrating experience. I found this wonderful essay very helpful in understanding related deficits in the ADHD brain and how we might strategize to plan for success.

2022-03-09 04:05:07;ohhhhh, no wonder parents don't think ADHD is real;"ok, so if ADHD is genetic, odds are one or both of your parents have it too. but if they never got a diagnosis, then they've just dealt with it their entire lives and have gotten to a point where they don't even consider it a possibility. this is especially true if your parents are way too boomer to go see someone about their mental health. so if you exhibit the same symptoms they just think you take after them. after all, you're their kid, so naturally they'd expect you to act kinda like them. and then they try to give you the same ""coping skills"" which of course won't necessarily work, especially considering you're a generation removed so it's a different ballgame.

huh.

2021-12-08 12:49:34;55 years on ritalin, I'll answer any questions about my experiences;"Hi, I'm Tom,
In 1966 I had several sessions with the UCLA medical center psychology department and was diagnosed with adhd. I have been on ritalin for the most part ever since. 

I am in good health, heart is strong, blood pressure normal, blood tests show no compromise to liver or kidneys. I do have high cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Currently, I am taking zoloft to keep me balanced, a pill for triglycerides and 20mg of ritalin once or twice a day as needed. I used to take as many as 5 pills a day as prescribed. Now that I'm older (m63) my metabolism is slower and I don't need as much. 

A couple of times I stopped for a year or two and watched things spiral. 
One of the prevalent benefits of ritalin is that I like myself.  Without ritalin I'm an ass and lack the discipline to curb my actions and words.
I recall in 1969 while riding my bike without ritalin, I sat at the side of the road and cried because I lacked the focus to pedal. 
With ritalin I had a long (37 year) career as an industrial engineer even though I didn't finish college. 

I am happily married to the woman of my dreams. 

I am no longer hyperactive.  I was and I'd like to share a story. 
In 1964 I was 6 and in 1st grade, I was so short that my feet didn't touch the floor. I sat in the front front row of the class and my legs would swing all day. Well the nun teaching (we'll call her sister Karen) was always yelling at me and called my parents stating that I was trying to kick her. My mother said that no old so and so was going to treat me like that. She took me out of school and home schooled me the rest of the year. I returned to traditional school for 2nd grade the following year .

I will gladly answer your questions about my personal experiences in particular for parents concerned for a adhd child.";r/ADHDers;98;29;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/rbj1cq/55_years_on_ritalin_ill_answer_any_questions/
2021-09-27 23:58:44;A lot of us before diagnosis believed we had a motivation problem, and thought we just need more motivation in order to force through. But after learning that I/we have a focus disability, I believe if any normal person had motivation equal to that of an ADHD person, they would conquer the world.;"This might be different for people who are only hyperactive, I don't know how that affects you guys. (I'm primarily inattentive)

How many times have we set up schedules, device reminders/alarms, tried associating certain tasks to certain other tasks, locked apps/devices/distractions, etc., all just to accomplish normal things?  How many of us have started running/lifting/exercising just to get bored and not really do anything while there and to end up not going next time?  Then we try again, fail, try again, get frustrated, just to try again and fail later?  Eventually we get discouraged and quit for a while, just to get frustrated and try again later.

We don't lack motivation, not at all, we just lack control over our focus.  No normal person is like this.  They just...do things.  When they want to.  They might struggle sometimes, but never to this extent.  And because of that, they don't have _nearly_ as much motivation as _we_ do.  No one is more motivated than someone who feels like they _should_ be able to make it work _if only they could just try harder._

Imagine what we could have accomplished with all this motivation if we didn't have this disability.  Think of that goal you gave up on because you just couldn't get the hard stuff done.  Think of all the wasted time trying and failing at homework that could've been used in a different way if we were able to finish this stuff in time.

If we kept the motivation level and just gained a normal person's focus control, I think we'd all have accomplished incredible things.

2021-06-23 18:14:36;I just finished three highschool classes at age 30. Started highschool at age 15, dropped out, almost finishing twice, dealing with depression, failure, failed attempts and more in the past 15 years. And now for the first time: I am god damn proud of myself!;"Hi :)  
Sorry for the rant, I just feel like sharing :)  
**TL:DR at the bottom**

I've tried finishing highschool (what is equivalent in Denmark) since I was 15 (in 2005). I was 3 months from finishing the 3 years, when I dropped out because I broke down. It was the worst years of my life at that point. Later (when I was 21) I was retroactively diagnosed with clinical depression from the age of 15. When I was 19, I tried finishing a 2 year compressed high school course, and that's when my depression really hit me, and I stopped attending with 4 months left. I was living on my own, and I basically hid for a few months in my apartment. After that I was diagnosed with depression and started on anti-depressants etc. A couple of times I tried taking a online courses to finish the subjects I was missing to get the full diploma, but I couldn't get through them. I've had nightmares of sitting in classrooms, the stress of having assignments due that I couldn't get done and all that stuff.

Fast forward to 2018. Working full time as a sales assistant in a retail store. I started cutting down on my antidepressants on my own, and finally in December 2018 I stopped, without withdrawals.  
4 months later I meet the girl of my dreams, and I got myself a girlfriend. I felt good. But I had a hard time relaxing, focusing and anxiety from too much talk, and thoughts about the future. Fast forward again to 2020. I decide, with my girlfriend's support, to slowly start taking a couple of courses online, so I can get my diploma. I'd start with 3 classes, two of the biggest, and one easier one: English (advanced foreign language), Danish (literature - biggest subject of all, in highschool), and Geography (introduction). These are all compressed 1-year courses. I start in September. But I am still stressed, anxious... my brain is overworked. Not because of the courses, but because of everything.  
In February I make an appointment with my doc, and after a talk she refers me to a psychiatrist and soon I am diagnosed with ADHD(ADD), I start taking my Ritalin (later Concerta), and later some Sertralin for my anxiety. It all works - it's awesome!!! LUCKILY because I of the Covid-19 situation most exams are cancelled, and I just have to have a casual conversation with some of the teachers, so they can assess a grade from the conversation and all my assignments. For 10+ years I've feared exams, and feared all of this... I've avoided it at all cost. ""Sadly"" it turns out that the Danish oral exam and written exam are not cancelled, because of the sheer size and importance of the class. It's hard, and my biggest fear tbh.

I know I'm decent at English, but I suck at the formalities, and at limiting my answers and understanding the questions, because I overanalyse everything. So I had no idea about what grades I would get.  
Geography I'm good at, since I like everything scientific and fact-based. But my teacher apparently didn't understand my reasoning in my reflection when I talked to her because I do a LOT of reflection. So I guess it can be confusing to people who don't.  
Danish I figured I would get a mediocre grade. I only read what was required to do the assignments, and I suck at remembering the formalities, and analyses, what to focus on etc. So I always have to start over, with every new assignment. I panicked when I found out I had to do an oral exam.

First was the written danish exam. 5 hours. I had planned my time, and what kind of assignment I would chose. The first hour I would use on reading the texts, form my opinion, and get ready to discuss the subject. The next three I would spend on writing, and the last hour I would use to read through the assignment and make corrections. At the exam... I spent the first 2,5 hours reading, analysing, forming an opinion, and get an idea of what to write... then I spent 1 hour trying to write, but I was stuck. Then I had a breakthrough and I spent 1,5 hours writing, and the last 5 minutes I got the formalities (headline, page number etc), but I never read it over or anything :o

Next was the oral exam... I had great plans to read up on all the subjects, but it was more of a quick glance at the curriculum. Then came the day, where I had my first REAL oral exam... I was sure I was going to fuck it up, but at least it would be over soon! I had feared this in all the years since I was 15... now 30.  
When I get there I drink some energy drink, my mind is all over...  
I go in to meet the examiners, and I play it as cool as I possibly can, make a joke, smile etc.  
I pull the question and the text, and get 50-60 minutes to prepare. I have no idea about what to do. I spent 40 minutes reading about the genre, and 15 minutes analysing the text.  
I come back in to the exam, and I start talking... I talk, I talk... after a while they ask me some questions, I have NO idea what to answer... But I talk and pretend... And suddenly the 30 minutes are up. I go outside and think... at least it's all over and I can do with a D or a C... after only 10 seconds they ask me to come back in.  
And immediately say: ""Well obviously you get an A!""  
I'm dumbfounded. What the fuck... I start laughing and I say ""WHAT? A? I thought maybe a C?"" but they assure me, I nailed it.  
I honestly can't believe it. How can I, someone who has had a deep fear of everything related to this, get the best possible grade in the subject I find the hardest?! For the first time since I can remember I felt proud! I had a real success! A feeling we rarely get with our ADHD brains... I called my girlfriend, she starts crying. I call my mom and my dad, they get so happy.

A few days later (yesterday) I get the grades for my other classes! Geography: A, English Oral: A, English Written: B and Danish Written: B!!!!  
I honestly can't believe it!! I had never ever thought I would be able to do this good! I've never lived up to my potential before, but I thought grades like that was unreachable for someone with my brain...  
I am proud of myself! I don't feel proud or happy all the time... but for a few seconds sometimes, I get a burst of a feeling I haven't felt before. Proudness! It's crazy.

Now, for the next year I'm going to take more classes, and cut down on work :) And after NEXT summer I'll start getting my bachelors degree.

*""For those whose ADD was not diagnosed and treated until they became grown-ups, the magnetism of past experience keeps bringing them back to old habits and old states of mind, even if they have received the best treatment available.*

*They are haunted by fears of failure, even if they have succeeded many times. They are still tormented by feelings of insecurity, even if they are objectively as secure as any human can be. They can't believe they have achieved what they've achieved, which means they can't fully own it, enjoy it, and feel nourished by it.""*

2021-05-26 07:23:50;I'm a 38 year old woman, not an 8 year old boy. Just because you don't recognize my ADHD doesn't mean it's not real.;"I have struggled with whether to speak openly about my ADHD for a long time. I was diagnosed at 9 years old and again at 21. I was not given medication the first time, and so I developed a LOT of coping mechanism which I'm very thankful for. I've always played it off with ""oh well I'm just a list person"". 

I was told by the psychologist who diagnosed me as an undergraduate that I'd never be able to do grad school without meds, so I tried them for the first time my first year of my MA. It was amazing! I compare it to a radio that is not completely tuned to the station. You can hear the announcer's voice, but nothing is clear and it's grating to listen to. Then suddenly: the radio is properly tuned and you can enjoy the station. Everything was so clear and I could focus on whatever I wanted. However I couldn't stand the side effects, and quickly stopped the medication and never tried anything new.

Instead, I color coded, organized, and sweat my way through. You're all familiar with working twice as many hours to keep up with everyone else. But I did it, I actually got two separate master's degrees. Because I'm not stupid, my brain just works differently. It really helped that I could do work when my head was in the game, and take breaks, and change locations... All much harder in the working world. 

But lately I've been thinking, a lot of people don't realized I have ADHD, and when I talk about it I'm shocked at how many people will out right say, ""oh but you must not have BAD ADHD"". My boss recently said, ""oh my son has REAL ADHD, you can tell because he can't sit still through a movie"". 

I want to blow up. I want to be visible, and educate people that basing a ""diagnosis"" only on the symptoms that bother you is not acknowledging what is actually going on for a person with ADHD. I understand your little boy won't sit still in class and ""doesn't listen"", but that's not what's going on for him. And the expression of ADHD symptoms for girls and women can include talking fast or a lot, or reading a lot of books. These are a couple traits that have been with me for years. I'm the girl waking down the street reading a book because I'm hyper focused and can't tear myself away, but I have to be somewhere. I also have days when I can't shower because the steps to getting there (undress, turn on water, wash both armpits...) Are all jumbled up and I don't have the executive function to sort it out.

But don't tell me you know I can't have ADHD because I'm not a hyper active 8 year old. Or because I'm good at school. And it makes me so mad I just don't want to talk about it to anyone.

I still get quite a lot of messages about this so thought I'd provide you with some insight. I posted another update 7 months ago with a bunch of info. Feel free to go through my profile and have a look for it.
I'm 6 months post treatment now and absolutely thriving after 3 years of having cancer and not knowing about it. I managed to start working only 2 months after my final infusion.
I still get scared about getting cancer again and being less fortunate this time. It has turned my into a bit of a health freak.
For those who are scared they might have lymohoma, please rest assured that it is one of the most treatable cancers out there, even at stage 4.
I can't diagnose anyone in hear, your best bet is to see your doctor. They will most likely take a biopsy, chest x-ray, blood tests etc...

2021-05-18 20:06:58;I have brushed and flossed for 41 WEEKS straight!;"For the first time in my 50+ years, I am actually excited to go to the dentist today. Prior to this I had never even managed to do both for the week before or after an appointment.

I have brushed and flossed for every single one of the **287 days** since my last appointment in August.

I was so disappointed when I rescheduled my previous appointment, but they aren't as covid aware as I would like. However, it has now been 13 days since my second shot, so I'm willing to chance it.

I fully expect them to say, ""*Romecat! What are you even doing here? Obviously you went to different dentist in the interim? Stop wasting our time!*""

TL;DR  I am a dental hygiene goddess and am really, really proud of myself!!

Edit:

So, I just found out that I am the type of person who posts, *""Thank you SO much for the awards!!""*

Normally I would feel embarrassed about being so proud of (what non-ADDers consider to be) basic hygiene, but it took me 4.5 decades to get here, so....

For my fellow ADDers:

My type is off-the-charts inattentive and I wasn't diagnosed until I was 40 so I have a LOT of *""You just need to try harder,""* baggage.

I have tried 5-6 meds and have untenable side effects to them all, so I am kind of pissed off in general. LOL

Obviously, the basic answer to how I did it is, ""I just did."" But that is a completely *worthless* response.

Last year I saw someone post about flossing for 30 days in a row and I was so freaking proud of them and was pleasantly surprised by how few snarky responses there were. I thought, I could do that.

But it wasn't until my appointment last August where I was fucking mortified by how bad it had gotten that I vowed to not let that happen again.

Even though I pay for dental insurance and have 2 ""free"" cleanings and 1 ""free"" exam per year, I had not been in 5 years. I also wasted up to $10k's worth of 50% coverage. There were more than a dozen factors that lead to that, but it still makes zero sense.

I put dental floss everywhere! Both bathrooms, by the sofa in the living room *(I don't care if that sounds gross,)* and by my bed.

My bottom teeth are really crowded because I lost my retainer when I was 15--shocker! I have to use waxed and I started tying a 12"" long piece in a loop since that made it easier to reach my back teeth and less likely to shred than using a pick.

Charts don't work for me so I just kept a, *""There is no way I am breaking this streak,""* mindset. We went on an overnight trip and I packed dental floss 3 different times, just in case any went missing. A LOT of things go missing whenever I am involved.

One of my main motivations was to post here.

All of this to say that if I can do it then I really believe that you can, too!!

 

Update, per request. How it actually went down.

I managed to get there at 3pm *on the dot*\--it was 12 miles away, so it took about 20 minutes so I was already winning from the get go. LOL

Many ADHD people suffer from POTS for years without realising.;"My psychiatrist told me that POTS is extremely common and heavily co-morbid with ADHD. Notably, it seems to be much more common in women (five times more than men), and sources such as [this](https://www.univadis.co.uk/viewarticle/apa-2019-1-in-10-pots-patients-is-diagnosed-with-adhd-instead-672604) claim that ADHD medication can exacerbate the symptoms.

According to Wikipedia: The primary symptom is an increase in heart rate of more than 30 beats per minute within ten minutes of standing up. These orthostatic symptoms include palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness or ""heaviness"" in the lower legs, blurred vision, and cognitive difficulties. Symptoms may be exacerbated with prolonged sitting, prolonged standing, alcohol, heat, exercise, or eating a large meal. In up to one third of people with POTS, fainting occurs in response to postural changes or exercise. Migraine-like headaches are common, sometimes with symptoms worsening in an upright position (orthostatic headache). 40-50% of patients with POTS develop acrocyanosis of extremities, a reddish-purple color in the legs and/or hands when they stand (indicative of blood pooling). 48% of people with POTS report chronic fatigue and 32% report sleep disturbances.

This was interesting to me because I've been suffering from symptoms for over a year now which have had no obvious cause or explanation despite many investigations on my part. Headaches, nausea, and just a general feeling of unwellness that gets worse throughout the day and by late afternoon, the only thing I can do is lie in bed. This has gotten worse overtime and is debilitating for my productivity, leaving me with only a measly few hours in the day that I feel well enough to work. I have realised my symptoms are likely POTS as the condition often begins in one's early 20's like I am, and the symptoms are only helped by lying down. However, the lack of research on the relation between POTS and ADHD (especially in women) leaves me uncertain on how to manage it, particularly in the context of ADHD medication.

Do any of you suffer from POTS or think you might suffer from it? I'd be interested to know if this is common among ADHD people.";r/ADHDers;124;37;https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/n5gobe/adhd_and_pots_postural_tachycardia_syndrome_1_in/
2021-05-05 20:31:05;"I am sick of trying to read stuff on the internet about ADHD when seemingly over 70% of the content talks about ""your child....."" or ""children with ADHD...."".";"I am a 24 year old male from the UK who got diagnosed last year. Sometimes I find myself procrastinating and start to research ADHD stuff when I become aware that I am procrastinating. I am SICK of reading yet another article or whatever presumably by someone who doesn't have ADHD starting sentences with ""if your child...."" or ""it's best to speak to your child"" or ""homework this homework that"". It makes me feel patronised, invisible, and ridiculed all at the same time. If these people are so knowledgeable about ADHD, which they claim to be, then why don't they include the word 'adult' and stop pretending we don't exist? There's this weird feeling I get where every time I see ADHD being mentioned in the context of children, I feel ignored and more importantly, as if I'm just a big baby who can't get their shit together and has to be compared to school children.

I know this is something that everyone is aware of (the fact that there is a big misconception about adult ADHD) but it still pisses me off every time. On a side note, I also don't like hearing professionals' opinion about ADHD when they don't have it themselves - it feels like we are their 'lab mice' and they have dedicated their life to studying something they will never truly understand. I know they know more than me and this is my sensitive and overly emotional side speaking but I can't help but feel like they don't really know what it's like. This is why I would always prefer to be treated by someone who has it. Rant over haha";r/ADHD;6353;471;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/n5esmt/i_am_sick_of_trying_to_read_stuff_on_the_internet/
2021-04-12 03:32:29;Hi my name is holly and I have ADHD inattentive type. I’m almost 23 and I was diagnosed when I was 16. I’m an artist so I thought I’d share a lil drawing I did the other day about having ADHD. Lemme know what you think!;[No description];r/adhdwomen;5642;141;https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/moxkjr/hi_my_name_is_holly_and_i_have_adhd_inattentive/
2021-04-10 04:28:12;Don't assume that because you relate to the stories, experiences, and memes on this page that you have ADHD.;"I was a long-time lurker on this sub. I was sure I had ADHD, and after battling anxiety over it I saw a therapist followed by a Psychiatric Nurse (PMHNP), where I found out I have cyclothymia. Lots of mental disorders can result in distraction, lack of focus, hyperactivity, and many mental disorders can mimic each other. 

All this to say that just because someone's story sounds exactly like yours doesn't mean that you have ADHD. To all the lurkers out there, please go **seek help** **with an open-mind** to determine whether or not you have this disorder. These professionals \[probably\] won't judge you, they won't necessarily think you're after drugs, and they may be able to shed some light on your focus problems. 

I still see posts and relate incredibly closely to them, but I do not have ADHD.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments of support. It’s fantastic to hear all of the similar stories of misdiagnosis and difficulty in finding answers. Now I’m definitely going to seek a second opinion on cyclothymia and consider the possibility of having more than one diagnosis. Seriously, thank you all! I learned so many new things about misdiagnosis.";r/ADHD;4580;568;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mnpxsq/dont_assume_that_because_you_relate_to_the/
2021-04-02 22:14:38;Really quick before I forget to ask, is it a common adhd experience to finally make a plan and then willfully disregard it like a petulant child because it's too restricting and your past self is an idiot who doesn't understand that you need to trim your nails and research pets and take a nap etc;"instead of actually following the plan? I feel like a parent who just can't get my child to follow directions, the child being me. I haven't been diagnosed officially but I have terrible executive functioning and this particular issue is driving me crazy. It would be nice if I at least respected reminders when they came to my attention. Does anyone else have this issue? How do you get around it? Thanks

2021-02-23 02:22:05;ADHD should really be renamed something like Executive Function Disorder or Executive/Emotional Regulation Disorder;"It’s wild how misleading “attention deficit hyperactivity” is. How many people have never been diagnosed because they saw the name and were like “*ok I clearly don’t have ADHD because I have attention but I just can’t help where it goes or when, also my emotions and memory and motivation are all whack but who knows why*” and never get the right support they need.

At least give ADHD a more relevant name that doesn’t immediately mislead people. 

It not only hinders productive conversation about ADHD but also really downplays the myriad of other symptoms that can have way more serious impacts on people’s wellbeing than something like “Can’t Stop Fidgeting Disorder” suggests.";r/ADHD;6744;540;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lpvp2p/adhd_should_really_be_renamed_something_like/

2020-09-08 06:53:57;I went through 700 reddit comments and collected 131 ADHD pro-tips!;"So there was that awesome [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/?sort=top) with a bunch of ADHD'ers sharing **real tips** that have changed their life.

I thought it was a great change from most advice on the internet which is written by non-ADHD'ers (and it's painfully obvious that it is).

I read through the 700+ comments and paraphrased, merged and categorised all the tips.

&#x200B;

The 131 tips are split into the following categories:

* General
* Cleaning
* Memory
* Time Blindness
* Distractions
* Getting Things Done
* Emotional Dysregulation
* Sleep
* Relationships
* Work
* School
* Executive Function
* Nutrition/Medication

# General

* Pack things the day before so you don’t forget \~ **(**u/digi-cow**)**
* Don’t drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people \~ **(**u/HiTechTek**,** u/beatadhd)
* Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. \~ **(**u/robertaloblaw**,** u/beatadhd)
* Use text-to-speech generators to help you read webpages/books \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Stretch once in awhile. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a deep breath. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**,** u/beatadhd)
* Get a therapist if you can. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* If you aren’t diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don’t spend more time wondering - you’ll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don’t worry… \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. \~ **(**u/amazona_auropalliata**)**
* Buy a whiteboard to sketch out things when your mind starts going into overdrive. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don’t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. \~ **(**u/ksettle**)**  
>  
>*People are in such a rush these days… You can’t expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.*

# Cleaning

* Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) \~ **(**u/BrownShoeJenny**)**
* Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Whenever you lose something that you “put away,” start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. \~ **(**u/FullDisclosureDaemon**)**
* In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don’t have a place. \~ **(**u/mmc09**)**
* If you’re moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It’s already on your way and it’s one less thing cluttering your room. \~ **(**u/SweetTeaBags**)**
* If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. \~ **(**u/swarleyknope**)**
* Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you’re cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It’s fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can “habit-chain” cleaning into going to bed. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) \~ **(**u/dani-tp**)**  
>  
>*Cleaning became so easy once I started using a “side” to stimulate my brain. I’m mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .*

# Memory

* Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks \~ **(**u/zombiessalad**)**
* Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way \~ **(**u/gibbousboi**)**
* Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. \~ **(**u/GoodGuyVik**)**
* Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. \~ **(**u/girlabout2fallasleep**)**
* Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. \~ **(**u/fizzzzzpop**)**
* Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. \~ **(Unknown)**
* Three point check when you close the front door: Phone, wallet, keys \~ **(**u/cowboyhugbees**)**
* Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time” \~ **(**u/theviciousfish**)**
* Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can’t leave without your lunch \~ **(**u/Therealdickbut**,** u/Maktube, u/mismanager)
* If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. \~ **(**u/redbananass**)**
* Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It’s hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) \~ **(**u/TotallyLegitEstoc**,** u/nathanb131)
* Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it’s too hard to do it for everything) \~ **(**u/nathanb131**)**
* Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) \~ (u/significanttoday**)**
* If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. \~ **(**u/VectorGambiteer**)**
* Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It’ll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it’s not too much that you’ll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) \~ **(**u/bethknowsbest**)**
* Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can’t leave without ALL the stuff you need. \~ **(**u/pockunit**)**
* ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I’m going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. \~ **(**u/sdjrp**)**
* Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it’s routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly* ***feels like cheating***\*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I’m currently using my own private tool\* 😉

# Time Blindness

* Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose \~ **(**u/Anonredditthoughts**)**
* Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment \~ **(**u/Alyscupcakes**)**
* A schedule is only as good as the alarms and info you put in \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you’re working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. \~ **(**u/dinamyte519**)**
* Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it’ll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. \~ **(**u/insaxon**)**  
>  
>*Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I’ll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can’t trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer*

# Distractions

* Disable all your notifications on your phone except for essential apps (Texting, Voicemail, Calendar) \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Use website blockers for distracting websites *(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)* \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**,** u/michaeltheobnoxious)
* If you can’t stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don’t actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you’ll respond when you get a minute. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Your brain focuses better after some exercise. *Cardio works best* \~ **(**u/unofficialuser112**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (“I don’t regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.”) \~ **(**u/rn7889**)**  
>  
>*Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.*  
>  
>*If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.*

# Getting Things Done

* If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it’s the first thing you see \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Learn to plan around transitions. It’s easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use the pomodoro technique for everything. It’s great having a break to look forward to. \~ **(**u/ontapeina_sthrnaccnt**)**
* Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. \~ **(**u/xxxistentialist**)**
* Attach numbers to events. e.g: Going to bed (3) - Brush, Floss, Mouthwash. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Lie to yourself. I’ll tell myself that I’m just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I’ve started, I’ll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. \~ **(**u/coffeeclichehere**)**
* Decide what you’re going to do each day beforehand, preferably while your meds are at their workingest. Make sure it’s only 1 thing. \~ **(**u/optimisticaspie**)**
* Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you’ll do something later, understand that future you is still you. Future you isn’t more likely to muster up the desire to do the work. f you don’t have the motivation to do it in the next 24 hours then future you probably won’t either. \~ **(**u/Moon_In_Scorpio**)**
* When you need to transition between tasks, pretend that you are talking to a friend who is having issues with something. Give yourself a nudge and remind yourself it’s time to switch tasks/get started. (Detach yourself from the task) \~ **(**u/Gerryislandgirl**)**
* When you take breaks, make sure your break isn’t too interesting. That way you won’t get absorbed in your break. Just clean during your break or something like that. \~ **(**u/Treppenwitz_shitz**)**
* Gamify things and set a limited amount of time to accomplish something. e.g: Brew your coffee and get as many chores done as you can before the coffee is finished brewing. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Write TODO lists as a brain dump. And then order them in importance or the order you want to do them in. That way you don’t pause while writing down tasks. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Don’t be afraid to stimulate yourself if you need it. Listen to a podcast or music to get yourself to do something. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* Reward yourself when you get things done. Positive Reinforcement is good and you’ll feel like getting more things done. \~ **(**u/prince-ali-but-short**)**
* Change your environment and work from a place where there are fewer distractions. e.g: Cafe/library. You’ll get more stuff done \~ **(**u/humbled_lightbringer**)**
* Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you don’t feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. \~ **(**u/talking_face**)**
* Change your alarm sounds/timer sounds frequently, but use alarms and timers as much as possible. \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Treat timers and alarms like non-negotiable laws. When the timer goes off, doesn’t matter what you were doing seconds ago, it’s time to go. Half showered, wet hair, one eye done, whatever it is, you’re out the door. \~ **(Unknown)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Body doubling - if you need to do some work that requires focus without much fun, have someone in the room with you. They could be working too, or not. Just having them there makes everything just a little more interesting and a little more accountable. \~ **(**u/Creebjeez**)**  
>  
>*I feel like a lot of people are missing some sort of accountability system in their lives. I don’t do body doubling but I use Beeminder to keep me accountable.*

# Emotional Dysregulation

* Brain dump in a notebook by your bed every night. \~ **(**u/ALyscupcakes**)**
* Don’t feel bad about sucking at school/work. You’ll get better as you learn more strategies for coping with ADHD. Things get better \~ **(**u/astrozork321**)**
* Use writing/journaling as cognitive therapy to defuse emotional history \~ **(**u/Tman1307**)**
* Remind yourself that the world won’t end if a few things fall behind. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Write a reverse todo-list. Write down the things you have accomplished for the day. That way you won’t feel overwhelmed and it’ll make you feel better. \~ **(**u/SuspiciousEchidna**)**
* You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)
* Forgive yourself for your limits. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Meditation. Active breaks for people that struggle to take breaks. Use a meditation app when you’re starting. Like Headspace \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**)**
* Start working on letting go of shame. It depresses your motivation and only makes things worse. You wouldn’t shame someone in a wheelchair for not getting things done, your difficulty is in your brain instead of your legs but it’s no less real. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**
* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy + meditation **\~ (**u/beatadhd**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)  
>  
>*Stop hating yourself. Don’t look at the future. Don’t look at the past. Look at the present. I used to always hate myself for being so unproductive. I realised how pointless that was and I started to focus on improving myself in the* ***present.***

# Sleep

* Put your phone on the other side of the room and make your alarm super loud. Gets you out off bed and will make you turn it off so you don’t wake other people up. \~ **(**u/Valendr0s**)**
* If you’re having trouble getting out of bed then set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes and chuck it across the room. It’ll force you to get up and turn it off. \~ **(**u/PMDicksInTinyClothes**)**
* Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15min before you want your alarm to go off in the morning. The lights help your body know its daytime \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Change your thermostat so the temperature goes down an hour before bedtime and gets warmer 30 minutes before you wake up. The cooler temperatures get your body to sleep and the warmer temperatures help you wake up \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use a reminder app for starting your bedtime routine, not just your bedtime. (And have a bedtime routine) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Try setup meetings/commitments early in the morning. They'll force you to get out of bed \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Set two alarms when you get up in the morning. One to get out of bed and one for your medication. e.g: 5:30 AM wake up and take medication and then fall back to bed. By your 6AM alarm you’ll have waken up and your meds will have kicked in \~ **(**u/BizzarduousTask**)**  
>  
>*What a great lifehack.* *I’ve been doing this the past few days (except I don’t wake up at 6AM) - it works pretty well. Also I throw my phone on the other side of the room so it forces me to get out of bed.*

# Relationships

* It’s okay to be in a room with people and just let people breathe. You don’t need to fill the silence. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* When having a conversation or learning something, repeat every word the person says in your head. It’ll help you not drift off as much. It also makes it so you’ll interrupt people less. \~ **(**u/TheNocturne**)**
* Try to avoid the word 'but' when faced with a conflict. Instead try be constructive towards arguments/discussions with the word 'and'. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** For maintaining eye contact: Imagine a red dot on someone’s nose for intense focus. Bridge of the nose for paying attention. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**  
>  
>*Haven’t tried this one but I used to have trouble with eye contact a few years ago so this stood out to me. I’m pretty good with eye contact now, but I’ll be trying it over the next few weeks anyway.*

# Work

* If you hate your job. Make a job switch. It’ll help you make positive changes in your life. \~ **(**u/Mooberry_**)**
* Find a job that works WITH your system. If you can’t wake up and be functional in the morning then stop trying. Find a job that doesn’t need you to wake up in the morning. Stop beating yourself up over things your brains isn’t designed for \~ **(**u/obxunseeker**)**
* Be self-employed and start a business. “No matter where I worked or what I did, I was constantly watching the clock, hating every single second of it. On Saturday I worked 27 straight hours to finish a job on time and it was still less painful than working an 8 hour shift as an employee. Those 27 hours disappeared and left me feeling gratified because I made someone’s house beautiful and I got to see how happy I made her the first time she saw her new home.” \~ (u/jake7697**)**
* When promising a timescale to a client, double or triple the amount of time that you initially think it will take. That way worst case scenario, you will finish it on deadline and meet expectations or best case, finish before and exceed expectations. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* The moment you know you aren’t going to make a deadline, let the client know and again give them an overestimate of time for new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative for this quick communication. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Reply to emails and messages when you read them. 99% of the time, days and weeks will go by if you tell yourself that you’ll reply later on… \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can’t understand our inability to do basic things at times. Especially if you come across as smart and creative, they can misplace our struggles for laziness and lack of care. If you fuck up own it, explain why and apologise. It doesn’t have to be long winded but it is important to state how you aim to rectify the situation and again. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Stop comparing your output and motivation to others and embrace a slower, more considered, creative one. You are not other people. You are you. Trying to jam your freeform, 12 sided shape into the round hole is painful and won’t work. You don’t need a hole, you need self acceptance. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Learn to say no to taking on things that you know may cause you stress and excess pressure just because it’s money. It is not worth it, just put the boundaries that will save your mental health in the first place and you won’t have to deal with the fallout later. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**

# School

* Use Active Recall + Spaced Repetition to study for all your exams. I've seen countless people go from C's to straight A's after adopting them \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If you're finding it difficult to start assignments early then ONLY read + annotate the assignment brief early and go take a break after that. Your subconscious should process the information and it'll be easier to start later on. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* It’s better to turn in an assignment that is 75% done. It’ll drag your grades down less than if you never turned it in \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**)**
* Print out lectures and powerpoints in advance (ask the teacher for them). That way you won’t need to listen and write at the same time. You can annotate the printed versions instead. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Visit your school's inclusivity and disability team. They will hopefully have policies for helping people with ADHD \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

# Executive Function

* Setup a morning routine + a reset routine. A reset routine is something you do when you're feeling super unfocused. Mine consists of meditation, exercise, journaling, playing music and making some tea. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If it takes less than ten minutes to do the task, just do it immediately. \~ **(**u/Zzazu**)**
* Have a uniform for work, social and casual scenarios. Don’t mix your work clothes with your casual clothes. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* If you start to feel frustrated for no reason, eat something and keep yourself hydrated. (Self-care flowchart) \~ (u/enjakuro)
* it’s better to half-ass most things than it is to not do them at all. \~ **(**u/coffeclichehere**)**
* Set alarms using music rather than the default alarm sounds. It’ll help you get going. (And music releases norepinephrine in your brain!) \~ **(**u/redditraptor6**)**
* Make yourself kits for common repeated household tasks. e.g: Cleaning Kit, Package mailing kit… Reduces the friction needed to get started on a task \~ **(**u/sonjavalentine**)**
* Refine your routine and rituals to reduce the overall time it takes to get them ready. Reduce the friction needed to start your morning routine. e.g: Prepare a filled pot of coffee the night before. \~ **(**u/lazyoracle**)**
* Set just a few non-negotiable standards and laws for yourself. Pick those that improve your life the most. e.g: No phone in bed at night or in the morning. Not even a quick email check. And read your goals every morning. \~ **(**u/AllsFarrin**)**
* When you’re trying to get started on a task: Write down the steps you’ve already done and the steps you plan to do next. Helps a lot with spaghetti thoughts \~ **(**u/qui_gone_Gym**)**
* Drink a big glass of water when you know you are going to have to start doing a thing in a bit. When you inevitably have to go pee, start after you wash your hands. You are already up and your brain already had to switch gears. Use it as momentum. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** On tough days. Use the 1-thing theory. Just try and accomplish just one-thing for that day. e.g. Clean the kitchen. \~ **(**u/soggysocks63**,** u/GoodGuyVik)  
>  
>*A bit less life-hacky compared to the others but I’ve found that getting started is a lot easier when you only have a single priority.*

# Nutrition/Medication

* If you are Vitamin D deficient then take Vitamin D supplements (see a doctor first). It’ll help your mood and energy levels. \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**
* Eat lots of protein and stay hydrated. \~ **(**u/chlordane_zero**)**
* Figure out if you're deficient in anything and try fix those things. This includes getting a food allergy test, figuring out deficiencies and eating a healthy diet. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a 7-day pill organiser with AM/PM slots and put your medication and supplements there. \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

2020-06-18 10:14:12;I told my boss about my adhd diagnosis and it went perfectly;"Yesterday I decided to quit my job after 3 years. I emailed my letter of resignation stating my diagnosis and how I had to take time to work on myself. I also told my boss that the new store manager was undervaluing me because she took my quietness and chilled out nature as a sign that I had a bad attitude and no enthusiasm to work there.

I thought that was it. Then he called me and seemed very shocked and upset about my reasons for quitting. He said he totally disagreed with the new managers opinion of me and said that I was a solid rock of our store. He then said he didn't want me to have to leave in the middle of a pandemic (noone else is really hiring at the moment) and made a deal with me.

So, I'm now getting 2 months paid leave and then transferring somewhere away from that manager. I'm so shocked with the outcome and my recent diagnosis made me think I was gonna be fucked forever. I don't know why I'm posting here I'm just really happy";r/ADHD;4271;130;https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hb5mu6/i_told_my_boss_about_my_adhd_diagnosis_and_it/

2019-01-27 12:32:32;A Message to the ADHD Community (serious);"I'm the father of an 11 year old boy with ADHD.  I don't remember the exact year that my wife and I had him diagnosed, but I always knew he had it.  My wife didn't always know, but that's a long story for another post.

Many of you are probably wondering what the point of this post is.  Maybe I am too.  But I have been lurking here occasionally, and some of the stories I read break my heart.

So here's my message to this community...


It's okay.  

It's okay that I asked you to take out the trash and you forgot.  It's just trash.

It's okay that sometimes you're late for school, and sometimes you forget to bring your homework home.  What I care about are the other times.  The times you come home happy that you made a new friend, or that you got an A.  Or a B.  Or a C.  It's just school.

It's okay that you are sometimes irritable.  Irritating.  Infuriating.  You're also kind.  Humble.  Caring.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  And that's more than just okay.

It's okay that sometimes you're a little hard to follow.   That sometimes you talk about three different things at once.  I wish I knew as much as you, that I had the passion that you have about the things that excite you.  

It's okay if you choose to take medication to make your life easier.  Don't like meds?  That's okay too.

The point is this.  You are all wonderful, beautiful, amazing people.  You come from all walks of life.   You've all taken a different path.  Just know that there are people who care about you.  There are people who get you.  There are people who love you, and want you to be happy.

It will be okay.
